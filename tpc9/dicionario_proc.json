        "Ankle Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nRegional anesthesia is increasing in its utility in the treatment of injuries, foreign body removal, and even in the operative setting. By providing a regional block, the affected anatomy can be properly cleaned, explored, and treated without causing unnecessary pain to the patient. In many settings, regional anesthetic is also preferred because it prevents the distortion of the anatomy commonly seen in local anesthesia. \nRegional anesthesia of the ankle presents a challenge to the provider because of the complicated nerve supply to the foot and the varied locations of the nerves around the ankle. However, by adequately anesthetizing the foot, patients can be offered relief from often painful injuries while the complex anatomy of the foot is examined and repaired. See Ankle Joint Anatomy for more information. \n\n\nProviding local anesthesia to the foot, particularly to the sole, presents many difficulties. First, the thick but sensitive skin must be penetrated with a needle, which often must be a larger gauge than might be used elsewhere to pass through the skin — this can be very painful. Second, the underlying soft tissue of the sole is tightly bound to the fascia and does not separate easily; injecting even small amounts of anesthesia locally into the sole can result in compression of blood vessels and vascular damage to the tissue that is already injured. But, with regional anesthesia, each of these difficulties can be avoided by blocking the pain sensation carried from the foot at the point where the nerves pass through a safe, readily accessible region of anatomy.\n [1] \nAn image depicting a cross-section of the ankle can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-section of the ankle. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Bullard Laryngoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nBullard laryngoscopy uses a rigid fiberoptic laryngoscope that was designed for use with patients who are difficult to intubate. In certain patients, it is not possible to visualize and access a target area, such as the glottis, without considerable effort and distortion of the internal anatomy of the patient. The Bullard laryngoscope (see the image below) resolves this problem with its simple and effective design. Bullard laryngoscopy allows visualization of the larynx without requiring alignment of the pharyngeal, laryngeal, and oral axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullard laryngoscope. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nThe Bullard laryngoscope was invented by James Roger Bullard of Augusta, GA, in 1993 and was patented for use in 1995. It was a breakthrough in the area of fiberoptic medical devices for visualization and minimally invasive procedures. The Bullard laryngoscope refined manipulation and visualization in the field of laryngoscopy.\n\n\n\n\nLaryngoscopy is a procedure whereby the airway and the passage into the airway (the glottis) is visualized or exposed to provide a route for the administration of anesthetic gases, introduce an endotracheal tube for securing the airway, allow a detailed examination of the larynx and its structures, or perform minor endolaryngeal procedures (eg, obtaining tissue specimens for biopsy).\n\n\n\n\nIn the resting human larynx, the epiglottis usually protects, and thus covers, the opening of the glottis. Therefore, it needs to be retracted out of the way when doing any of the other procedures. This retraction of the epiglottis is facilitated by laryngoscopy with the help of the blade of the laryngoscope.\n\nThe first generation of laryngoscopes have a straight (Miller) or a curved (Mackintosh) blade, which is adequate for performing routine laryngoscopy in a patient. However, certain characteristics of a patient or a clinical situation may render laryngoscopy cumbersome or even hazardous. These scenarios may give rise to what is known as difficult intubation. In these cases, standard endotracheal intubation using a Miller or a Mackintosh blade may prove challenging and even result in failure. Alternative methods are then used, which may include the use of a Bullard laryngoscope to bypass or overcome these difficulties.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe larynx is located within the anterior aspect of the neck, anterior to the inferior portion of the pharynx and superior to the trachea. Its primary function is to protect the lower airway by closing abruptly upon mechanical stimulation, thereby halting respiration and preventing the entry of foreign matter into the airway. Other functions of the larynx include the production of sound (phonation), coughing, the Valsalva maneuver, and control of ventilation, and acting as a sensory organ.\n\nThe larynx is composed of 3 large, unpaired cartilages (cricoid, thyroid, epiglottis); 3 pairs of smaller cartilages (arytenoids, corniculate, cuneiform); and a number of intrinsic muscles (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarynx anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Larynx Anatomy and Throat Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nIndications for Bullard laryngoscopy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn obese or overweight patient with a thick, short neck\n\n\n\n\nBreast hypertrophy\n\n\n\n\nProminent incisors, receding mandible, anterior larynx, intraoral masses, edema, secretions, scar, or bleeding\n\n\n\n\nLimited mouth opening due to structural problems, such as temporomandibular joint syndrome, ankylosis, large tongue, or facial fractures\n\n\n\n\nInability to position the patient optimally for intubation, such as in disease and/or instability of the cervical spine (eg, kyphosis with barrel-chest deformity, spinal fractures)\n\n\n\nBullard laryngoscopy has distinct advantages in patients who are difficult to intubate, have limited or undesirable head and neck movements, have limited mouth openings, have facial fractures, or are morbidly obese. Bullard laryngoscopy causes less cervical spine movement than conventional laryngoscopy. Moreover, in patients with cervical spine disease, the Bullard laryngoscope provides quicker intubation compared with flexible fiberoptic intubation.\n\nOther advantages include rapidity of intubation, but the time for intubation may be longer for patients with Mallampati class III scores than for patients with Mallampati class I or II scores.\n [1] \n\nWith Bullard laryngoscopy, there is a low risk of failed intubation, less trauma to the lips and teeth, and less discomfort in the awake patient than other methods. The Bullard laryngoscope is sturdy and less likely to be damaged. It causes less cardiovascular instability than the Macintosh blade with conventional intubation technique.\n\nIn patients with severe maxillofacial injuries (eg, after a motor vehicle collision), awake intubation with conventional direct laryngoscopy may be unsuccessful because of distorted airway anatomy, a cervical collar, presence of excessive blood in the oropharynx, and lack of patient cooperation. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy may not even be attempted because blood and secretions may be too numerous to allow adequate visualization.\n [2] \n\nThe use of the Bullard laryngoscope, in conjunction with forceful oxygen flow through its insufflation port, may allow the practitioner to effectively clear blood and secretions in patients with maxillofacial injuries. The oxygen insufflation port of the Bullard blade is much larger in diameter than that of a conventional fiberoptic bronchoscope. This allows for more forceful delivery of oxygen through the instrument. In addition, the Bullard laryngoscope is particularly effective in trauma situations because the patient's head may be maintained in a neutral position (eg, without removing the cervical collar, if present).\n [2] \n\nThe Bullard laryngoscope may be an ideal instrument for intubation of the trachea in a patient with acute epiglottitis. Traditional laryngoscopes involve pressure on an already swollen and compromised epiglottis. Fiberoptic laryngoscopes are easily deflected by the donut shape of the epiglottis. Considerable trauma can occur while blindly trying to slide the tube over the scope itself.\n [3] The Bullard laryngoscope barely touches the epiglottis on insertion and provides a clear view of the vocal cords and larynx. Also, the endotracheal tube can be viewed as the tube is placed into the trachea.\n [3] \n\nIn a study of cadaver models, both with restricted and unrestricted mobility of the cervical spine, the Bullard laryngoscope was found to produce less cervical spine movement and a better view, with intubating time similar to the GlideScope, Viewmax, and Macintosh laryngoscopes.\n [4] \n\nContraindications\nNo absolute contraindications exist for the use of Bullard laryngoscope. However, there is a considerable learning curve and inexperienced persons are not encouraged to use this laryngoscope in difficult situations. For example, it has been found that the video-optical intubation stylet is especially useful when a difficult tracheal intubation is anticipated or encountered, as it is simpler to execute and more effective.\n [5] \n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nThere is a considerable learning curve for the use of Bullard laryngoscope. Inexperienced persons are not encouraged to use this laryngoscope in difficult situations. In addition, the Bullard laryngoscope is expensive and is cumbersome to clean and maintain.\n\nConstant positioning and repositioning while changing the tip extender blade may increase the costs and risks of the surgical procedure being undertaken.\n\nIf a tracheal tube larger than 7.5 mm is used, the introducing stylet may be pushed posteriorly and thus obscure the view.\n\nSometimes, the orotracheal tube may hit against the right arytenoid cartilage and a large epiglottis, leading to problems.\n\nIf laser is to be used, the metallic laser tube cannot be fitted over the introducing stylet. In these cases, a standard tube has to positioned first and then the metal laser tube should be introduced using a tube exchanger.\n\nProcedure Planning\n\nBefore use, the tip of the laryngoscope blade housing the image bundle at the end of the sheath should be cleaned thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Carpal Tunnel Steroid Injection": "\nOverview\n\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common mononeuropathy due to entrapment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Symptoms include hand paresthesia, numbness, and pain in the median nerve distribution of the hand. Conservative treatment options, in addition to carpal tunnel steroid injection, include rest, splinting, oral steroids, ultrasound, yoga, physical therapy, and ergonomic modification.\n [1] Surgical intervention is reserved for severe symptoms.\nClinical testing for carpal tunnel syndrome includes the Tinel test, which is performed by lightly tapping the median nerve eliciting paresthesia in the nerve distribution of the hand. Additional testing includes the Phalen test, which increases pressure in the carpal tunnel by forced wrist flexion for several minutes.\n\n\nCarpal tunnel steroid injection has been shown to reduce short-term symptoms prior to definitive surgical intervention. Local steroid injection and surgical decompression both are effective treatments at 2-year follow-up, with surgical intervention having some additional benefit.2\n [2] \nElectrodiagnositc studies such as nerve conduction studies and electromyography can be used to determine median nerve compression severity.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe wrist is a complex joint consisting of the distal portion of the radius and ulna articulating with eight carpal bones which in turn articulate with the proximal aspects of five metacarpal bones. Together, these bones are responsible for flexing and extending, pronating and supinating as well as ulnar and radial deviation.\n\n\n\n\nThe carpal tunnel is defined ventrally by the flexor retinaculum, attached radially to the scaphoid and trapezium, and the pisiform and hamate on the ulnar side. The carpal bones define the dorsal border of the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel contains four tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus, four tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis as well as the flexor pollicis longus tendon. Just deep to the flexor retinaculum is where the median nerve traverses the carpal tunnel. This branch of the median nerve supplies the sensory innervation of the first three digits and the radial half of the fourth digit.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Wrist Joint Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Deep Peroneal Nerve Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nDeep peroneal nerve block is one of the 2 deep nerve blocks at the level of the ankle. The deep peroneal nerve block is easy to perform and may constitute part of an ankle block.\nThe deep peroneal nerve block is useful for anesthesia and postoperative analgesia to surgeries of the first web space (eg, Morton neuroma). It can also be used to treat chronic pain conditions like anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome.\n\n\nAnatomy\nThe common peroneal nerve (root values: L4, L5, S1, and S2) winds around the fibula through the fibular tunnel. The tunnel is bordered by the peroneus longus tendon and the fibula. Just distal to the fibular tunnel, the nerve divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The deep peroneal nerve (or the anterior tibial nerve) begins at the bifurcation of the common peroneal nerve, between the fibula and upper part of peroneus longus.\n [1, 2] In the distal one third of the ankle, the nerve is located between the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus muscles and is superficial to the anterior tibial artery. At an average distance of 12.5 mm proximal to the ankle, the nerve crosses deep to the extensor hallucis longus tendon and courses between the extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus tendons.\n [3] The image below shows the nerve and adjacent structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep peroneal nerve and adjacent structures. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the leg, the deep peroneal nerve supplies muscular branches to the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius, and extensor hallucis longus. It also provides an articular branch to the ankle joint.\n\nThe deep peroneal branch continues into the foot along with the tibial artery and the vein. It passes beneath the dense superficial fascia of the ankle. Then it divides into lateral terminal and medial terminal branches.\n\nThe lateral terminal branch (external branch) passes across the tarsus anterolaterally, enlarges and supplies the extensor digitorum brevis. From the enlargement, 3 minute interosseous branches (dorsal interosseous nerves) are given off, which supply the tarsal joints and the metatarsophalangeal joints of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th toes. The medial terminal branch (internal branch) accompanies and runs medial to the dorsalis pedis artery along the dorsum of the foot. At the first interosseous space, it divides into dorsal digital nerves, which provide sensory innervation to the first webspace and the adjacent dorsum of the foot.\n\nTwo cm distal to the intermalleolar line, the following structures (from medial to lateral) are related to the deep peroneal nerve: \n\n\n\nTendon of tibialis anterior\n\nTendon of extensor hallucis longus\n\nDorsal pedis artery\n\nDeep peroneal nerve\n\nTendon of extensor digitorum longus\n\n\nBlocking the following five nerves (3 superficial and 2 deep) results in complete block of sensory perception beneath the ankle: \n\n\n\nSuperficial peroneal nerve\n\nSaphenous nerve\n\nSural nerve\n\nDeep peroneal nerve\n\nPosterior tibial nerve\n\n\nAll 5 nerves should be blocked if a tourniquet is used for foot surgery.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Digital Nerve Block": "\nBackground\n\n\nDigital nerve blocks are important tools for the emergency medicine clinician. Injuries or infections of the digits are extremely common. Adequate analgesia is essential to properly address the presenting condition and to minimize the patient's discomfort. Digital blocks are useful in many scenarios in which local infiltration of an anesthetic would require several injections into the already painful site of injury. Furthermore, local infiltration around the wound may create increased swelling, making the repair more difficult. Several techniques are available for performing digital blocks.\nRelevant anatomy\nEach digit is innervated by 4 digital nerves. In the upper extremity, the digital nerves arise from the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. The 2 palmar digital nerves innervate the palmar aspect of the digit and the nail bed, whereas the dorsal nerves innervate the dorsum of the digit (see images below). The tibial and peroneal nerves branch off into the digital nerves of the lower extremities, which follow a pattern of distribution analogous to those of the upper extremity.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalmar digital nerves. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDorsal digital nerves. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Ear Anesthesia": "\nOverview\n\n\nAnesthesia of the ear is useful for repair of lacerations, hematoma incision and drainage, and other painful procedures of the ear.\nAnatomy\nThe ear is composed of 3 compartments: the external ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. For the purpose of local anesthesia, this article focuses on the external ear which comprises the auricle, or pinna, and the ear canal. The auricle (visible part of ear) is composed mainly of cartilage covered by skin and consists of the helix, antihelix, lobule, tragus, and concha.\n\n\nAnatomy of the ear is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the ear. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nFour sensory nerves supply the external ear: (1) greater auricular nerve, (2) lesser occipital nerve, (3) auricular branch of the vagus nerve, and (4) auriculotemporal nerve.

        "Epidural Nerve Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nEpidural nerve block has become a significant advance in neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia. Dr. James Leonard Corning described the procedure in 1885\n [1] and Cuban anesthesiologist Manual Martinez Curbelo, in 1947, first used an epidural catheter.\n [2] \nThe procedure is commonly performed as a sole anesthetic or in combination with spinal or general anesthetic. The duration of anesthesia or analgesia is prolonged when epidural catheters are used. Patients are able to control their pain with patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) in a manner similar manner to that of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA).\n\n\nLocal anesthetic epidural blockade may be useful in conjunction with aggressive physical therapy or manipulation of a painful limb associated with joint stiffness or limited range of motion. Lumbar sympathetic blocks are more appropriate for evaluating and treating complex regional pain syndromes, as they provide a more selective evaluation by providing a discrete sympathetic block.\nIn comparison to epidural blocks, epidural injections of local anesthetic, steroids, or both are considered for the treatment of radicular pain symptoms secondary to disk herniation or postsurgical radicular pain. Epidural injections do not alter the course of the underlying process but may offer effective pain relief in selected patients. Epidural injections may be performed in the spinal region, including the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions. Fluoroscopic guidance may be necessary in patients with congenitally, surgically, or pathologically altered anatomy. The injections should be delivered into the area of the known pathology using midline, paravertebral, or transforaminal approaches. Caudal steroid injections should only be used for patients with leg pain of sacral origin or in whom direct access to the lumbar region is impossible.\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering epidural nerve block, clinicians should follow a stepwise approach. First, an accurate diagnosis must be made by obtaining a pertinent neurological history and examination and performing the appropriate diagnostic confirmatory tests.\n\n\n\n\nIn the ever-expanding field of interventional pain management, epidural injections of pain medications like steroids play an important role in chronic pain management. Long-term indwelling epidural catheters are helpful in managing severe pain in cancer and noncancer chronic pain conditions. Certain conditions with sympathetic mediated or maintained pain are treated with the epidural local anesthetic since it provides sympathetic blockade.\n\nAnatomy\nThe cephalad part of the spinal epidural space begins at the level of foramen magnum, where the periosteal and spinal layers of dura fuse together. The caudal part extends to the sacrococcygeal membrane. The anterior portion of the epidural space is formed by the posterior longitudinal ligament, which covers the posterior part of the vertebral body and the intravertebral disk. Posteriorly, the epidural space is formed by the anterior lateral surface of the vertebral lamina and the ligamentum flavum. Laterally, the epidural space is formed by the pedicles of the vertebrae and the intravertebral foramen. The ligamentum flavum is used as the key landmark for identification of the epidural space. It is thinnest in the cervical region. Also note that the epidural space is narrowest in the cervical region, with an anterior/posterior diameter of 2-3 mm. The images below show the interlaminar epidural space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpine model showing interlaminar epidural space. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpine model showing lateral view. Lumbar spinous processes are more horizontal. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAn understanding of the basic anatomy of the epidural space also requires recognition of the following key anatomic features of the spine. The spine is composed of cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal vertebrae. The cervical spine is much more mobile than the thoracic or lumbar regions of the spine. Unlike the other regions of the spine, the cervical spine has foramina in each vertebra for the arteries supplying blood to the brain. The vertebrae support most of the weight to the spine. A bony projection on either side of the vertebral body called the pedicle supports the arch that protects the spinal canal. The laminae are the parts of the vertebrae that form the back of the bony arch that surrounds and covers the spinal canal. A transverse process is on either side of the arch, where some of the muscles of the spinal column attach to the vertebrae. The spinous process is the bony portion of the vertebral body that can be felt as a series of nodules in the center of an individual's spine.\n\nBetween each vertebra in the spine are disks that act as shock absorbers and also permit some movement between the vertebral bodies. They are made up of a strong outer ring of fibers called the annulus fibrosus and a soft center called the nucleus pulposus. The annulus helps keep the disk's inner layer intact.\n\nIn addition to the invertebral discs, facet joints between each of the vertebral bodies allow the individual bones of the spine to move and rotate with respect to each other. Several muscle groups that move the trunk and the limbs also attach to the spinal column. The neural foramen is the opening where the nerve roots exit the spine and travel to the rest of the body. Between each pair of vertebrae are 2 neural foramina (1 on each side). Finally, the spinal cord extends from the base of the brain and ends at the lower level of the first lumbar vertebra and the top of the second lumbar vertebra. The group of nerves at the end of the spinal cord is called the cauda equina. The dura mater forms a protective watertight sac around the spinal cord and nerves. The spinal cord is surrounded by spinal fluid inside this sac.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Epidural Steroid Injections": "\nOverview\n\n\nEpidural steroid injections (ESIs) have been endorsed by the North American Spine Society and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) of the Department of Health and Human Services as an integral part of nonsurgical management of radicular pain from lumbar spine disorders.\nThe first documented epidural medication injection, which was performed using the caudal approach (see the image below; see also Approaches for Epidural Injections) was performed in 1901, when cocaine was injected to treat lumbago and sciatica (presumably pain referred from lumbar nerve roots).\n [1] According to reports, epidurals from the 1920s to 1940s involved using high volumes of normal saline and local anesthetics. Injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space for the management of lumbar radicular pain was first recorded in 1952.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaudal approach, lateral view. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nESIs can provide diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. Diagnostically, ESIs may help to identify the epidural space as the potential pain generator, through pain relief after local anesthetic injection to the site of presumed anatomic pathology. In addition, if the patient receives several weeks or more of pain relief, then it may be reasonable to assume that an element of inflammation was involved in his or her pathophysiology. Since prolonged pain relief is presumed to result from a reduction in an inflammatory process, it is also reasonable to assume that during the period of this analgesia, the afflicted nerve roots were relatively protected from the deleterious effects of inflammation. Chronic inflammation can result in edema, wallerian degeneration, and fibrotic changes to the neural tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "General Anesthesia": "\nGeneral Considerations\n\n\nGeneral anesthesia (GA) is the state produced when a patient receives medications to produce amnesia and analgesia with or without reversible muscle paralysis. An anesthetized patient can be thought of as being in a controlled, reversible state of unconsciousness. Anesthesia enables a patient to tolerate surgical procedures that would otherwise inflict unbearable pain, potentiate extreme physiologic exacerbations, and result in unpleasant memories.\nThe combination of anesthetic agents used for general anesthesia often leaves a patient with the following clinical constellation:\n [1] \n\n\n\nUnarousable to painful stimuli\n\nUnable to remember what happened (amnesia)\n\nUnable to maintain adequate airway protection and/or spontaneous ventilation as a result of muscle paralysis\n\nCardiovascular changes secondary to stimulant/depressant effects of anesthetic agents\n\n\n\nGeneral anesthesia\nGeneral anesthesia is induced and maintained using a combination of intravenous and inhaled agents.

However, regional anesthetics have a unique application for procedures of the hand, including axillary, Bier, wrist, and digital blocks. When used in the proper setting and patient population, regional anesthesia can be applied safely for procedures involving the upper extremities and the hands. In general, small needles and lower volumes of local anesthetic should be used in regional anesthesia to minimize the risk of neurovascular complications. Moreover, epinephrine can be used to augment local anesthetics to provide a longer duration of action, lower risk of adverse systemic effects, and less bleeding at the surgical site.\nThe techniques of administering regional anesthetics for hand surgery, the pharmacology of local anesthetics, and special conditions associated with hand surgery are discussed.\n\n\nLocal anesthetics\nSeveral local anesthetic agents are available for use in hand and upper extremity surgery. Clinicians must consider the requirements of the local anesthetic for each individual case, including the duration of the procedure, tolerance of the patient, and allergies to anesthetic agents. Knowledge of the basic pharmacology of local anesthetic agents is critical to proper selection of these agents for specific procedures and patient types.\n [1] For more information, see Local Anesthetic Agents, Infiltrative Administration.\n\n\n\n\nLocal anesthetics produce a transient block of nerve conduction by interfering with sodium channels.\n [2, 3] This effect of the anesthetic interferes with the development of an action potential across the nerve. Local anesthetics are classified into 2 groups, esters and amides, based on their organic structure. The clinical behavior between the 2 classes is significantly different. Local anesthetics of the ester class include cocaine, procaine, tetracaine, chloroprocaine, and benzocaine. The amide class of local anesthetics includes lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, etidocaine, and ropivacaine.\n\n\n\n\nMetabolism\nRegarding the metabolism of local anesthetics, esters are rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase. The esters are more quickly metabolized by plasma pseudocholinesterase so that blood levels do not rise significantly to cross the placental barrier. Because chloroprocaine is the most rapidly hydrolyzed ester, it is the anesthetic drug of choice for pregnant women. Amides are degraded intracellularly in liver cells. The degradation of amides is a longer process, which results in some accumulation of the anesthetic and a greater chance of a systemic reaction, especially with repeat doses.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nA total of 27 bones constitute the basic skeleton of the wrist and hand. The hand is innervated by 3 nerves — the median, ulnar, and radial nerves — each of which has sensory and motor components. The muscles of the hand are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic groups.\n\nThe median nerve is responsible for innervating the muscles involved in the fine precision and pinch function of the hand. It originates from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus (C5-T1). In the forearm, the motor branches supply the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. The anterior interosseus branch innervates the flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus (index and long finger), and pronator quadratus muscles.\n\nThe ulnar nerve is responsible for innervating the muscles involved in the power grasping function of the hand. It originates at the medial cord of the brachial plexus (C8-T1). Motor branches innervate the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus muscles to the ring and small fingers. Proximal to the wrist, the palmar cutaneous branch provides sensation at the hypothenar eminence. The dorsal branch, which branches from the main trunk at the distal forearm, provides sensation to the ulnar portion of the dorsum of the hand and small finger, and part of the ring finger.\n\nThe radial nerve is responsible for innervating the wrist extensors, which control the position of the hand and stabilize the fixed unit. It originates from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (C6-8). At the elbow, motor branches innervate the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Hand Anatomy.

        "Image-Guided Stellate Ganglion Blocks": "\nOverview\n\n\nStellate ganglion blocks have been utilized for almost a century to treat a variety of medical conditions. Today, stellate ganglion blocks are most commonly used in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically maintained pain in the head, neck, and upper extremity. There are many painful and nonpainful conditions that may benefit from this interventional procedure. The more common indications include complex regional pain syndrome of the upper extremity and face and vascular disorders. This technique was first described as a blind procedure using landmarks. There have been a number of techniques described and developed using different imaging modalities and approaches to block the stellate ganglion. \nThe sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in neuropathic, vascular, and visceral pain, making it a good target for the treatment of a variety of disorders. The stellate ganglion is part of the sympathetic network formed by the inferior cervical and first thoracic ganglia.\n [1, 2] It receives input from the paravertebral sympathetic chain and provides sympathetic efferents to the upper extremities, head, neck, and heart. Sympathetically maintained pain occurs in a variety conditions such as upper extremity or facial complex regional pain syndrome type I and II (formerly named regional sympathetic dystrophy [type I] and causalgia [type II]), vascular pain conditions, Raynaud's disease, and refractory angina.  \n\n\nStellate ganglion blocks have traditionally been performed blindly by palpating the anterior tubercle of the transverse process of C6 (Chassaignac tubercle) and directing a needle to the C6 transverse process while retracting the the carotid laterally. Once bony contact is made, the needle is slightly withdrawn to rest outside of the longus colli muscle. Large amounts of local anesthetic may be used in small aliquots after repeated negative aspiration.\n [3, 4] This blind method has a relatively high failure rate, with numerous significant and even potentially fatal adverse effects. Due to the risk profile with blind procedures and advances in technology, this procedure is routinely performed with fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. Computed tomography (CT)-guided techniques have also been described in the literature. Image-guided stellate ganglion blocks have the advantages of increased safety and accuracy compared with blind injections. The needle can be accurately placed near the stellate ganglion, and, as a result, a safer and smaller amount of local anesthetic can be used, reducing the risk of adverse effects.\n [5] \nAnatomy\nThe cervical sympathetic chain is composed of the superior, middle, and inferior cervical ganglia. In approximately 80% of the population, the inferior cervical ganglion fuses with the first thoracic ganglion, forming the cervicothoracic ganglion also known as the stellate ganglion.\n [6, 7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the surrounding anatomy of the stellate ganglion is critical for an effective block and to avoid serious and even life-threatening complications. The stellate ganglion lies anterolateral to the C7 vertebral body.\n [6] Structures lying anterior to the ganglion include skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, investing cervical fascia, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the carotid sheath (containing the internal jugular vein laterally, carotid artery medially, and vagus nerve posteriorly). The lung apex lies anterior and inferior to the ganglion. Medial structures include the C7 vertebral body, esophagus, trachea, thoracic duct, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and thyroid gland. Posterolateral structures include the anterior scalene muscle with the phrenic nerve, brachial plexus and its branches, vertebral artery, and longus colli muscles.\n\nThe prevertebral fascia must be entered before these posterolateral structures become accessible. The inferior (serpentine) thyroid artery lies anterior to the vertebral artery at the seventh cervical level.\n [8] More commonly, however, is its location as it traverses the carotid artery posterior at C6, going laterally to medially into the thyroid gland. An important landmark located superior to the stellate ganglion is the anterior tubercle of the C6 vertebral body, Chassaignac tubercle (carotid tubercle). This is a commonly used landmark because it is easily palpated. Injection at this location allows for tracking of the local anesthetic down the prevertebral fascia to the stellate ganglion below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Inferior to that branch, the mandibular nerve splits into an anterior trunk (both sensory and motor) and a posterior trunk.\n\nThe motor component supplies the masseter, temporal, and lateral pterygoid muscles.\n\nThe posterior trunk radiates from the auriculotemporal nerve that gives sensory perception to the side of the head and scalp and sends twigs to the external auditory meatus, the tympanic membrane, and the temporomandibular joint. The posterior trunk then almost immediately divides into the lingual nerve and the inferior alveolar nerve.\n\nThe sensory trunk is the long buccal nerve that supplies the buccal soft tissue distal to the first molar.\n\nThe lingual nerve supplies the anterior two thirds of the tongue and the lingual surface of the mandibular gingiva.\n\nThe mandibular nerve sends a branch to the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle and then enters the mandibular canal.

        "Infraclavicular Nerve Block": "\nBackground\n\n\nSeveral techniques for infraclavicular nerve blocks have been described. The coracoid approach was first described by Whiffler in the British Journal of Anaesthesia in 1981. This technique was most commonly used with nerve stimulation. The use of ultrasound offers more flexibility in approaches, giving the provider different choices for needle insertion depended on patients’ anatomy and best ultrasound image.\n [1, 2] \nAll upper extremity blocks involve the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus arise from the anterior rami of C5-8 and T1 with some contribution from C4 and T2. The rami unite to form superior, middle, and inferior trunks. They occupy the space between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Each trunk divides into anterior and posterior divisions, which rejoin to form 3 cords: the lateral, posterior, and medial. The medial brachial cutaneous and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves come off the medial cord. The cords then pass into the axilla and divide into nerve branches: the musculocutaneous, axillary, radial, median, and ulnar (see the image below).\n [3, 4] The brachial plexus can be blocked anywhere along its course, from the neck to the axilla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of brachial plexus rami, trunks, divisions, cords, roots and nerves. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Infraorbital Nerve Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe infraorbital nerve block is often used to accomplish regional anesthesia of the face. The procedure offers several advantages over local tissue infiltration. A nerve block often achieves anesthesia with a smaller amount of medication than is required for local infiltration. In addition, unlike local tissue infiltration, nerve blocks can provide anesthesia without causing tissue distortion. Therefore, the infraorbital nerve block is a convenient alternative for situations such as facial lacerations in which tissue distortion would be unacceptable.\nIn general, regional anesthesia is ideal when the area of interest is innervated by a single superficial nerve. The infraorbital nerve supplies sensory innervation to the lower eyelid, the side of the nose, and the upper lip (see image below). Since the infraorbital nerve provides a considerably large area of sensory innervation, it is a prime candidate for a regional nerve block.\n [1] A successful infraorbital nerve block provides anesthesia for the area between the lower eyelid and the upper lip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea of anesthesia for infraorbital nerve block. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nThe trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), provides sensory innervation to the face.\n [2] The second division, the maxillary nerve (V2), exits the skull from the foramen rotundum.

        "Interscalene Nerve Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nInterscalene nerve block refers to the placement of local anesthetic around the roots or trunks of the brachial plexus at the level of the C6 vertebral body between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. The procedure was first well described and popularized by Alon Winnie in 1970.\n [1] \n\n\nInterscalene nerve block is typically performed to provide anesthesia or analgesia for surgery of the shoulder and upper arm.\n [2, 3, 4] The interscalene block is not effective for surgery of the hand or forearm that involves the ulnar nerve distribution of C8-T1. Although shoulder surgery can sometimes be performed under interscalene block and sedation, many practitioners prefer to use it in conjunction with general anesthesia.\nIndications\nIndications for interscalene nerve block include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nShoulder surgery (arthroscopic or open) including total shoulder replacement, hemiarthroplasty, rotator cuff repair, labral repair, and acromioplasty\n\n\n\n\nHumerus fracture\n\n\n\n\nClavicle fracture\n\n\n\n\nOther arm surgery that does not involve the medial aspect of the forearm or hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nContraindications for interscalene nerve block include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient refusal\n\n\n\n\nInfection at planned injection site\n\n\n\n\nPreexisting neurologic defects\n\n\n\n\nLocal anesthetic allergy\n\n\n\n\nCoagulopathy\n\n\n\n\nContralateral phrenic nerve dysfunction\n\n\n\n\nSevere chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\n\n\nAnatomy\nThe five roots (anterior rami) of the brachial plexus originate from the spinal nerves of C5-T1. These pass out of the intervertebral foramina, over the superior aspects of the transverse processes, and run downward in the neck towards the first rib. These roots will join and divide several times to form trunks, divisions, cords, and then finally emerge as terminal nerve branches. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brachial plexus and nearby structures in the neck. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe roots combine to form trunks as they cross the first rib. The superior trunk is formed by C5 and C6, the median trunk consists of C7, and the inferior trunk is formed from C8 and T1. During an interscalene block, the nerves are anesthetized at the root or trunk level.\n\nThe anterior and middle scalene muscles arise off the anterior and posterior tubercles of the transverse process of the cervical vertebrae and insert on the first rib. The subclavian artery and brachial plexus both cross over the first rib between these two muscles, with the artery being medial to the plexus. The roots of the plexus lie within a fascial sheath, which is formed from the fascia of the surrounding scalene muscles. The roots combine into trunks as they pass over the first rib. The plexus, artery, and fascial sheath continue down under the clavicle into the axilla.\n\nAlthough the above is the classic description of the anatomy, it is well known that there are not infrequent anatomic variations. Gutton et al examined 146 different brachial plexuses with ultrasound and found the following: 36% had an intramuscular passage of a root, 8% had a C5 root ahead of the anterior scalene muscle, and 23% had an artery crossing the roots or trunks.\n [5] Muhly and Orebaugh used ultrasound to examine variations in vasculature anatomy around the brachial plexus in the neck.\n [6] Scanning revealed an arterial branch adjacent to, or passing directly through, the brachial plexus in the supraclavicular region in 86% of patients. Within the interscalene region, an artery was identified coursing in a lateral direction in 90% of cases, while a corresponding small vein, coursing medial to lateral in this area, was noted in 46% of cases.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Brachial Plexus Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Labor and Delivery, Analgesia, Regional and Local": "\nOverview\n\n\nLaboring patients must be educated about the different available methods of labor analgesia. Many pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods of labor analgesia have been adopted over the years. Of these, neuroaxial or regional analgesia has become the most popular method. Possible regional anesthesia techniques include epidural analgesia, spinal analgesia (sometimes referred to as the intrathecal or subarachnoid space), or a combination of epidural and spinal analgesia. Approximately 60% of laboring women (2.4 million each year) choose regional analgesia for pain relief during labor.\n [1, 2] \nUterine contractions and cervical dilatation result in visceral pain. These pain impulses are transmitted by afferent, slow conducting, A-delta and C fibers that accompany the sympathetic nerves and enter the spinal cord at the T10 to L1 level. As labor progresses, the descent of fetal head and subsequent pressure on the pelvic floor, vagina, and perineum, generates somatic pain, which is transmitted by the pudendal nerve (S2-4). These rapidly conducting somatic pain fibers are relatively difficult to block.\n\n\nIn obstetric patients, regional analgesia refers to partial or complete loss of pain sensation below the T8 to T10 spinal level. In addition, a varying degree of motor block may be present, depending on the agents used. Advantages of regional analgesia include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nProvides superior pain relief in first and second stages of labor\n\n\n\n\nFacilitates patient cooperation during labor and delivery\n\n\n\n\nProvides anesthesia for episiotomy and instrumental delivery\n\n\n\n\nAllows extension of anesthesia for cesarean delivery\n\n\n\n\nAvoids opioid-induced maternal and neonatal respiratory depression from intravenous opioids\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides providing analgesia in labor, regional analgesia may facilitate atraumatic vaginal delivery of twins, preterm neonates, and neonates with breech presentation. It also helps control blood pressure in women with preeclampsia by alleviating labor pain, and it blunts the hemodynamic effects of uterine contractions and the associated pain response in patients with other medical complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Local and Regional Anesthesia": "\nOverview\n\n\nLocal anesthetics provide a reversible regional loss of sensation. Local anesthetics reduce pain, thereby facilitating surgical procedures. Delivery techniques broaden the clinical applicability of local anesthetics. These techniques include topical anesthesia, infiltrative anesthesia, ring blocks, and peripheral nerve blocks (see the Technique section below for links to detailed, illustrated articles demonstrating these techniques).\nLocal anesthetics are safer than general or systemic anesthetics; therefore, they are used whenever possible. In addition, they are relatively easy to administer and readily available. Local anesthetics have been undergoing development for centuries, and, as this article illustrates, research continues to provide surgeons with pharmacologic variety and to provide patients with anesthetic agents that have superior safety and efficacy profiles.\n\n\nBackground\nAlthough the medical world cannot cure every disease, the control of pain to ensure patient comfort should be a goal. In 1860, cocaine, the oldest anesthetic, was extracted from the leaves of the Erythroxylon coca bush. In 1884, Sigmund Freud and Karl Koller were the first to use it as an anesthetic agent during ophthalmologic procedures.\n\n\n\n\nProcaine, a synthetic alternative to cocaine, was not developed until 1904. Procaine is an ester of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). As procaine is metabolized, PABA, a known allergen, is released as a metabolic product. The potential for severe allergic reactions limits the use of procaine and other ester-type anesthetic agents. Tetracaine, another ester-type anesthetic, was introduced in 1930. Tetracaine is more potent than procaine, and it causes similar allergic reactions.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1943, an alternative class of anesthetics was discovered when Lofgren developed lidocaine. This agent is an amide derivative of diethylaminoacetic acid, not PABA; therefore, it has the benefit of a low allergic potential. Since then, multiple amide-type anesthetics have been introduced into clinical use. Slight chemical alterations to the compounds have imparted beneficial characteristics, including increased duration and potency, to each. These compounds offer the surgeon more choices, and anesthetics can be appropriately matched to different procedures.\n\nPathophysiology\nReviewing the physiology of nerve conduction is important before any discussion of local anesthetics. Nerves transmit sensation as a result of the propagation of electrical impulses; this propagation is accomplished by alternating the ion gradient across the nerve cell wall, or axolemma.\n\nIn the normal resting state, the nerve has a negative membrane potential of -70 mV. This resting potential is determined by the concentration gradients of 2 major ions, Na+ and K+, and the relative membrane permeability to these ions (also known as leak currents). The concentration gradients are maintained by the sodium/potassium ATP pump (in an energy-dependent process) that transports sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell. This active transport creates a concentration gradient that favors the extracellular diffusion of potassium ions. In addition, because the nerve membrane is permeable to potassium ions and impermeable to sodium ions, 95% of the ionic leak in excitable cells is caused by K+ ions in the form of an outward flux, accounting for the negative resting potential. The recently identified 2-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels are believed to be responsible for leak K+ currents.\n\nWhen a nerve is stimulated, depolarization of the nerve occurs, and impulse propagation progresses. Initially, sodium ions gradually enter the cell through the nerve cell membrane. The entry of sodium ions causes the transmembrane electric potential to increase from the resting potential. Once the potential reaches a threshold level of approximately -55 mV, a rapid influx of sodium ions ensues. Sodium channels in the membrane become activated, and sodium ion permeability increases; the nerve membrane is depolarized to a level of +35 mV or more.\n\nOnce membrane depolarization is complete, the membrane becomes impermeable to sodium ions again, and the conductance of potassium ions into the cell increases. The process restores the excess of intracellular potassium and extracellular sodium and reinstates the negative resting membrane potential. Alterations in the nerve cell membrane potential are termed the action potential. Leak currents are present through all the phases of the action potential, including setting of the resting membrane potential and repolarization.\n\nMechanism of action\nLocal anesthetics inhibit depolarization of the nerve membrane by interfering with both Na+ and K+ currents. The action potential is not propagated because the threshold level is never attained.\n\nAlthough the exact mechanism by which local anesthetics retard the influx of sodium ions into the cell is unknown, 2 theories have been proposed. The membrane expansion theory postulates that the local anesthetic is absorbed into the cell membrane, expanding the membrane and leading to narrowing of the sodium channels. This hypothesis has largely given way to the specific receptor theory. This theory proposes that the local anesthetic diffuses across the cell membrane and binds to a specific receptor at the opening of the voltage-gated sodium channel. The local anesthetic affinity to the voltage-gated Na+ channel increases markedly with the excitation rate of the neuron. This binding leads to alterations in the structure or function of the channel and inhibits sodium ion movement. Blockade of leak K+ currents by local anesthetics is now also believed to contribute to conduction block by reducing the ability of the channels to set the membrane potential.\n\nOn the basis of their diameter, nerve fibers are categorized into 3 types. Type A fibers are the largest and are responsible for conducting pressure and motor sensations. Type B fibers are myelinated and moderate in size. Type C fibers, which transmit pain and temperature sensations, are small and unmyelinated. As a result, anesthetics block type C fibers more easily than they do type A fibers. Therefore, patients who have blocked pain sensation still feel pressure and have mobility because of the unblocked type A fibers.\n\nAll local anesthetics have a similar chemical structure, which consists of 3 components: an aromatic portion, an intermediate chain, and an amine group (see molecular diagram below). The aromatic portion, usually composed of a benzene ring, is lipophilic, whereas the amine portion of the anesthetic is responsible for its hydrophilic properties. The degree of lipid solubility of each anesthetic is an important property because its lipid solubility enables its diffusion through the highly lipophilic nerve membrane. The extent of an anesthetic's lipophilicity is directly related to its potency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular diagram. \n\n\nLocal anesthetics are weak bases that require the addition of hydrochloride salt to be water soluble and therefore injectable. Salt equilibrates between an ionized form and a nonionized form in aqueous solution. Equilibration is crucial because, although the ionized form is injectable, the nonionized base has the lipophilic properties responsible for its diffusion into the nerve cell membrane. The duration of action of an anesthetic or the period during which it remains effective is determined by its protein-binding activity, because the anesthetic receptors along the nerve cell membrane are proteins.\n\nThe intermediate chain, which connects the aromatic and amine portions, is composed of either an ester or an amide linkage (see molecular diagram above). This intermediate chain can be used in classifying local anesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Local Anesthesia of the Airway": "\nBackground\n\n\nProcedures on the upper airway in an awake patient are challenging because of local factors such as excessive salivation, presence of gag reflex, and activation of cough reflex, as well as because of the systemic hemodynamic response caused by the stimulation of autonomic nervous system.\nAnesthesia of the airway is needed for attempts to access a difficult airway or for procedures performed through the airway in awake patients. In patients with recognized difficult airway, intubation under general anesthesia might lead to the risk of loss of control on the airway. Elective awake intubation is a safer option in these patients and is facilitated by abolishing airway reflexes by local anesthetic techniques. Local anesthesia of the airway is complicated due to the multiple nerves that are to be blocked. A thorough knowledge of the anatomy is essential for a successful procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Local Anesthesia With Sedation": "\nOverview\n\n\nLocal anesthesia with sedation offers anesthesia personnel and the surgeon great flexibility in tailoring the degree of anesthesia to the needs of the patient. Procedures that once required patients to stay overnight in the hospital are now performed safely in office and outpatient surgical suites.\n [1] The utilization of these anesthetic applications enables patients to undergo lengthy and complex procedures as outpatients and then more readily and safely be discharged home.\n [2] The choice and route of anesthesia administration is paramount to the patient's overall surgical experience. If, upon discharge, the patient is alert, has minimal pain, and has no nausea or vomiting, then the surgical experience was a positive one.\n [3] \nMonitored anesthesia care\nMonitored anesthesia care (MAC) combines intravenous sedation with local anesthetic injection, infiltration including tumescent anesthesia, or nerve blocks.\n\n\nProcedures such as otoplasty, facelift, blepharoplasty, or liposuction are examples of surgeries routinely performed under MAC. Patients given monitored anesthesia rather than general anesthesia experience fewer incidences of nausea and vomiting and typically can be discharged home safely and quickly.\n\n\n\n\nThe image below depicts intraoral approach for an infraorbital block. \n\n\n\n\n\nIntraoral approach for an infraorbital block. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary disadvantages of MAC are the lack of airway control and the threat of aspiration or obstruction. To minimize these risks, the anesthesia personnel must titrate the medications carefully to maintain spontaneous respirations while maintaining an anesthetic depth, allowing the patient to remain comfortable. Careful selection and administration of medications is essential in producing the desired and optimal intraoperative anesthetic effect and postoperative outcomes.\n\nLocal anesthesia\nLocal anesthesia encompasses infiltration of the operative site, tumescent techniques, and nerve blocks.\n\nA nerve block can be labeled minor if one nerve is affected or major if more than one nerve or conduction in a nerve plexus is impeded.\n\nLocal anesthetic agents are usually of the amino amides class and include such agents as lidocaine, bupivacaine, prilocaine, mepivacaine, and etidocaine. The potency, onset of action, and duration of these agents varies (see table below).

For incisional sites, a local anesthetic such as 1% lidocaine with epinephrine (EPI) is ideal for direct injection into the incisional site with rapid onset of the anesthetic effect. For procedures in which flaps are to be elevated, as in a facelift or coronal forehead lift, the incision site is anesthetized as previously mentioned, and the flap area can be infiltrated with a diluted anesthetic such as 0.5% lidocaine with EPI. This is a tumescent anesthetic technique. As an example, in a facelifting procedure both short-acting (lidocaine) and longer-acting (bupivacaine) anesthetics with EPI are injected into the incision line from the temple area, the preauricular and tragal incision site, and posteriorly into the posterior ear sulcus and postauricular scalp and neck areas, which are injected using a 30 gauge x 0.5 inch or 27 gauge x 1.25 inch needle. A diluted anesthetic such as 0.25% lidocaine with 1:400,000 EPI can be injected with a spinal needle (25 gauge x 3.5 inches) in a tumescent fashion, infiltrating (swelling) the subcutaneous area with this diluted mixture. The dilution can be made by combining 1% lidociane with 1:100,000 EPI with normal saline injectable in a 3:1 ratio.\n\nFor the local anesthetic, 1% lidocaine often is used with 1:200,000 or 1:100,000 EPI. The latter prolongs the anesthetic effect of lidocaine as a result of its vasoconstrictive properties. If more prolonged anesthesia is desired, lidocaine can be mixed with bupivacaine, providing the rapid but shorter lasting anesthesia effect of the former coupled with the slower but prolonged anesthetic effect of the latter.\n\nIn tumescent techniques, vastly larger amounts of anesthetic are used, albeit in diluted concentrations. Adipose tissue is suffused via an infusion cannula in the subcutaneous space, with large volumes of diluted lidocaine (0.05-0.1%) and a diluted concentration of EPI (1:1,000,000) for both anesthetic and hemostatic effects. The safety of this technique lies in the fact that the anesthetic concentration is extremely small, allowing large amounts of solution to be used without reaching toxic levels. For example, a mixture of 500 mL of normal saline with 50 mL of 2% lidocaine will result in a concentration of lidocaine of less than 0.2%. In addition, a tissue plane is created that aids in later dissection.\n\nGeneral anesthesia\nAlthough monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is a safe method for providing anesthesia, general anesthesia is preferred for lengthy or complex procedures. General anesthesia provides amnesia, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. In addition, the patient's airway is secured with an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask, and the risk of aspiration or obstruction is minimized.\n [4] The primary disadvantage of general anesthesia is the increased incidence of nausea and vomiting and the somnolence of patients postoperatively. However, in properly selected patients, local anesthesia with MAC is a safe and effective method of providing anesthesia for operative procedures. Another form of anesthesia, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), involves the use of full intravenous sedation and airway management via a laryngeal mask. This offers an alternative between MAC and general anesthesia.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Nerve Block, Dorsal Penile, Neonatal": "\nOverview\n\n\nCircumcision is an age-old practice, described in stone-age cave sketches and depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphics. Today, it is commonly performed to fulfill religious commandments, mark transition into adulthood, change cosmetic appearance and, arguably, affect health outcomes. Traditionally, practitioners have believed that the neurological system of the neonate was not sufficiently developed to permit the neonate to feel pain during this surgical procedure. However, studies have shown that neonate undergo changes in the cardiovascular system, hormonal levels, and behavioral changes during the circumcision procedure.\n [1, 2, 3] \nCircumcision in neonates was the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the United States prior to 1978; it was performed on more than 80% of neonatal males. The procedure was typically completed without pain-relieving anesthesia. The landmark 1978 Pediatrics article first describing dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) initiated a slow but steady change in clinical practice regarding this neonatal surgical procedure.\n [4] Numerous studies have revealed not only biochemical changes related to cortisol levels but also the obvious psychological signs involving respirations and tissue oxygenation changes.\n [1] Facial changes, crying, and gross motor movements confirm the painfulness of the procedure. Despite the obvious signs of an neonate's discomfort and pain during the procedure, tradition had held that the use of anesthetic was unnecessary and unwise.\n\n\nToday, 9 out of 10 residency-trained physicians use anesthesia during this procedure.\n [5] Much of this change was first fueled by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in their 1999 recommendation that some method of pain relief should be used during circumcisions and that such pain relief is associated with very little risk.\n [6] This policy statement was updated and affirmed by the 2012 Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision, which also states that non-pharmacological techniques such as positioning and sucrose pacifiers, although helpful, are inadequate alone for anesthesia and should be used only as analgesic adjuncts to improve infant comfort.\n [7]  Additional supports followed when several physician groups, including the AAP, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), recommended universal use of local or topical anesthesia for pain relief during circumcision. The technical specifics of the dorsal penile block procedure can be readily taught and learned and have proven to be highly effective.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nose Anesthesia": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nNasal anesthesia is required for the management of common routine and emergency procedures. These include nasal examination, nasotracheal intubation, management of nasal and facial trauma, increasingly common office-based sinonasal procedures, and management of facial and nasal abscesses. General anesthesia may not be an option because of the emergent need for intervention, medical risk factors, or operating room availability. \n\n\nDepending on the indication, satisfactory nasal anesthesia may be obtained by the use of topical sprays and pledgets, local injections, regional nerve blocks, or a combination of these. A comprehensive knowledge of the medications, techniques, and anatomy is the key to providing safe, timely, affordable, and effective local anesthesia.\nNasal innervation\nThe understanding of nasal innervation can be simplified by dividing it into the internal (mucosal) and external (skin) aspects of the nose.\n [1] The external nose is innervated by the ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) nerves, which are the first 2 divisions of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). The superior aspect of the nose, including the tip, is supplied by the infratrochlear nerve (V1), the supratrochlear nerve (V1), and the external nasal branch of the anterior ethmoid nerve (V1). The infraorbital nerve (V2) supplies the inferior and lateral aspects of the nose, extending to the lower eyelids.

The superior inner aspect of the lateral nasal wall is supplied by the anterior and posterior ethmoid nerves (V1). The sphenopalatine ganglion (V2) is located at the posterior end of the middle turbinate and innervates the posterior nasal cavity. The anterior and posterior ethmoid nerves (V1) and the sphenopalatine ganglion (through the nasopalatine nerve) provide sensation to most of the septum.

        "Paraspinal Injections - Facet Joint and Nerve Root Blocks": "\nOverview\n\n\nAnesthesiologists have performed facet joint and nerve root blocks for more than 50 years. Initially, these blocks involved the use of palpated anatomic landmarks and a large amount of steroids and/or local anesthetics. As techniques have been refined, fluoroscopic and CT guidance have become popular, because this guidance allows more precise needle placement and thereby a smaller amount of injected pharmaceutical and a lower complication rate. While anesthesiologists have continued to perform the procedures, the trend toward radiologic guidance has resulted in a greater number of injections performed by radiologists, particularly neuroradiologists and musculoskeletal radiologists.\nThe value of having radiologists perform the procedures is derived not only from their expertise in image-guided needle placement and radiologic anatomy but also from their more objective point of view. The treating physician is not influenced by the patient's physical findings or medical history, and he or she does not determine if the patient needs repeated injections. Separation of the referring physician and the treating physician eliminates any conscious or subconscious bias and can only benefit the patient.\n\n\nIn this article, the indications for facet and nerve root blocks are considered separately, because although the 2 injections are similar in nature and often performed in the same patient during a workup for back pain, they are designed to treat different pathologic processes. A short description of each technique follows, as well as a description of injection-related complications and coding issues.\nEfficacy\nSteroids are widely used in nerve root blocks, epidural injections, and facet joint injections in an attempt to provide temporary relief from pain. When selective nerve root blocks (SNRBs) are performed for disk herniations, the goal is to provide pain relief for enough time to allow the extruded disks to shrink. In more than 70% of disk herniations, the disk material resolves on its own, given enough time; however, this process can take well over a year. Despite this widespread use, for many years, the lack of randomized controlled trials resulted in questions about the efficacy of steroid injections, and the result of one study suggested that there was no difference between saline and steroids in relieving pain in the facet joint.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study by Riew et al was performed in patients who were surgical candidates and who initially wished to undergo surgery to relieve radiculopathy from nerve root compression.\n [2] Approximately 71% of those who underwent SNRB with betamethasone and bupivacaine elected not to have surgery (follow-up, 16 months), whereas only 33% of those injected with bupivacaine alone avoided surgery. A subsequent follow-up study in this cohort found that most of the patients who avoided surgery for at least 1 year after undergoing SNRB with bupivacaine, with or without betamethasone, continued to avoid operative intervention for a minimum of 5 years.\n [3] \n\nZennaro et al found the greatest efficacy of steroid injections in patients with foraminal stenosis, as compared with those who had foraminal disk herniations.\n [4] Devulder found that SNRB with steroids was associated with decreased treatment scores in patients with failed back surgery syndrome, as compared with scores in those not treated with steroids.\n [5] Most studies report an average time of pain relief as 1-3 months in those patients that have initial improvement, although some studies have described longer relief in a high percentage of patients.\n\nManchikanti et al performed randomized, double-blind, controlled trials to assess the efficacy of medial branch blocks for treating managing chronic neck or thoracic pain of facet joint origin.\n [6, 7] Results were similar in patients treated with bupivacaine alone and those who received bupivacaine plus steroid: at 1 year, over 83% of patients with neck pain and 79% of patients with thoracic pain showed significant pain relief and functional improvement. Patients required approximately 3 or 4 treatments a year.\n\nBoswell et al conducted a systematic review of facet joint interventions for treatment of chronic spinal pain\n [8] . Their findings were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor cervical intra-articular facet joint injections: limited evidence for short- and long-term pain relief\n\n\n\n\nFor lumbar intra-articular facet joint injections: moderate evidence for short- and long-term pain relief.\n\n\n\n\nFor cervical, thoracic, and lumbar medial branch nerve blocks with local anesthetics, with or without steroids: moderate evidence for short- and long-term pain relief with repeat interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Paravertebral Nerve Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nParavertebral nerve block was a popular technique in the early 20th century. However, for some reason, paravertebral nerve block lost popularity and was almost extinct until the late 1970s, when there was a renewed interest in the technique. This technique is now considered safe and efficacious.\n [1] \n\n\nA paravertebral block is essentially a unilateral block of the spinal nerve, including the dorsal and ventral rami, as well as the sympathetic chain ganglion. These blocks can be performed at any vertebral level. However, they are most commonly performed at the thoracic level because of anatomic considerations. Therefore, this topic primarily focuses on thoracic paravertebral blockade.\nIndications\nParavertebral nerve blocks are indicated for surgical procedures requiring unilateral analgesia or anesthesia. Common cases benefitting from unilateral paravertebral blocks are breast surgery, thoracotomy, herniorrhaphy, open cholecystectomy, and open nephrectomy. Bilateral paravertebral blocks can be a viable option for midline abdominal surgery.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clinician may consider thoracic paravertebral blockade over thoracic epidural analgesia in patients for whom bilateral sympathectomy and subsequent hypotension would be especially detrimental.\n [3, 4, 5] For example, the use of thoracic paravertebral blockade in a patient with severe aortic stenosis has been reported.\n [6] In another study, thoracic paravertebral blockade resulted in more stable hemodynamics and equivalent analgesia when compared to thoracic epidural analgesia in thorocotomy patients.\n [7] However, because bilateral spread can occur\n [8] , which may cause hemodynamic compromise similar to epidural blockade.\n\nAnother unique feature of thoracic paravertebral blockade compared with thoracic epidural analgesia is the relative safety when performing these blocks on patients with a marginal coagulation cascade. This does not mean, however, that thoracic paravertebral blockade can be performed on patients with coagulopathy without caution. According to the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine’s evidence-based guidelines, in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy, the exact same precautions should be taken when placing thoracic paravertebral blockade as when placing an epidural. However, if bleeding occurs in the thoracic paravertebral space, significant blood loss will be the likely complication rather than epidural hematoma and neurologic deficit.\n [9] \n\nContraindications\nContraindications to paravertebral nerve blocks include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient refusal\n\n\n\n\nSevere coagulopathy\n\n\n\n\nLocal infection\n\n\n\n\nAllergy to local anesthetics (rare, usually the allergy is to the preservative)\n\n\n\n\nSevere hypovolemia (especially for bilateral blocks)\n\n\n\n\nUntreated sepsis\n\n\n\nAnatomy\nThe thoracic paravertebral space is a triangular- or wedge-shaped space running the length of the thoracic vertebral column bilaterally (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the thoracic paravertebral space (outlined in dashed red line). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIt is bounded posteriorly by the superior costotransverse ligament (a continuation of the internal intercostal muscle); anteriolaterally by the parietal pleura; and medially by the vertebral bodies, intervertebral foramina, and the intervertebral discs.\n\nIn contrast to cervical and lumbar regions, the thoracic paravertebral space is in continuity with adjacent vertebral levels, allowing for spread of local anesthetic. This anatomic property explains why the thoracic paravertebral space may have more utility than cervical or lumbar paravertebral blocks.\n\nComplications\nComplications of paravertebral nerve blocks may include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nFailed block\n\n\n\n\nHypotension\n\n\n\n\nVascular puncture\n\n\n\n\nPleural puncture\n\n\n\n\nPneumothorax\n\n\n\nFailure rate may be lower with ultrasound, but this has not been studied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The sciatic nerve has a common epineural sheath that envelops the nerve trunks of the tibial and common peroneal nerve from their origin in the pelvis.\nThe sciatic nerve is formed by the union of the first 3 sacral spinal nerves and the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves (see the image below). It is the largest nerve supplying the leg. It leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and runs toward the posterior aspect of the thigh between the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity.

Avoid puncture through infected skin or skin lesions. Be sure to use sterile technique during the procedure, as the risk of infection is insignificant when sterility is properly maintained. \n\nIntra-arterial injection may result in vasospasm and lead to ischemia of the limb tissue. Intravenous injection can lead to systemic toxicity in high doses. Tissue texture changes revealing pallor, bogginess, and cool temperature may indicate that either intravascular injection or vascular compression has occurred. Always draw back the syringe to rule out intravascular placement before injection. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists (eg, phentolamine 0.5-5 mg diluted 1:1 with saline) can be administered by local infiltration to relieve arterial vasospasm secondary to intra-arterial injection.\n [10] \n\nPatients may develop paresthesia, sensory deficits, or motor deficits secondary to inflammation of the nerve. Most often, this type of neuritis is transient and resolves completely. During the procedure, pull back gently after induction of paresthesia so as to not inject the nerve directly. Make sure to document a complete neuromuscular examination both before and after the procedure.\n [11] \n\nReports of significant hemorrhage during regional anesthesia are rare, even in patients with blood coagulopathies.\n [9] A hematoma may develop with intravascular puncture. If prolonged bleeding occurs, attempt to obtain hemostasis with direct pressure and elevation. \n\nAllergic reactions to local anesthetics occur at a rate of 1%.\n [12, 10] Reactions range from delayed hypersensitivity (type IV) to anaphylactic (type I). Although rare, the most common cause of allergic reaction is the preservative in the local anesthetic solution. Cardiac lidocaine is an alternative because it does not contain the preservative. Alternatively, a 1-2% diphenhydramine solution can be used as a local anesthetic.\n [10] \n\nThe volume of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine should not exceed 5 mg/kg. If lidocaine with epinephrine is used, total volume should not exceed 7 mg/kg. Systemic toxicity manifests in the central nervous and cardiovascular systems.\n [12] Signs such as tremors, convulsions, tachycardia, or respiratory compromise should alert the physician to stop the procedure and reassess the patient. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Regional Anesthesia for Postoperative Pain Control in Orthopedic Surgery": "\nOverview\n\n\nRegional anesthesia refers to the focused delivery of anesthetic agent(s) to a given part of the body. Regional anesthesia is used extensively for various purposes, including as a primary anesthetic technique for surgery, as an analgesic modality to manage pain in the perioperative period, and as an analgesic modality for various other forms of acute and/or chronic pain. This article will focus on the use of regional anesthesia as a postoperative analgesic technique for orthopedic surgery.\nRegional anesthesia can be broadly divided into several categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Neuraxial anesthesia, including intrathecal (aka “spinal”) and epidural techniques\n         \n\n\n\n          Upper and lower extremity blockade for somatic analgesia\n         \n\n\n\n          Autonomic plexus blockade for visceral analgesia\n         \n\n\n\n          Peripheral nerve blockade for somatic analgesia\n         \n\n\n\n          Localized wound infiltration\n         \n\n\n\n          Topical anesthetics\n         \n\n\n\nThe use of perioperative regional anesthesia has many possible advantages. Regional anesthesia can reduce operative anesthetic requirements and in some cases allow avoidance of general anesthesia altogether. This can be beneficial to a variety of patient populations, including those at risk for cognitive dysfunction after general anesthesia.\n [1]  The use of regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques can offer superior overall pain control and reduced postoperative opioid requirements.\n [2, 3]  In addition, in certain operations, such as total hip arthroplasty (THA), the use of regional anesthesia may be associated with certain positive trends such as reduced blood loss and reduced rates of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n [3, 4] \n\n\n\n\nVarious regional analgesia techniques exist that can be used to promote postoperative pain relief. These methods can be categorized into neuraxial local analgesics and opioids, peripheral nerve blocks, and wound infiltration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Retrobulbar Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nRetrobulbar block is type of regional anesthetic nerve block used in intraocular surgery. In this technique, local anesthetic is injected into the retrobulbar space, the area located behind the globe of the eye. This injection provides akinesia of the extraocular muscles by blocking cranial nerves II, III, and VI, which prevents movement of the globe. Retrobulbar block also provides sensory anesthesia of the cornea, uvea, and conjunctiva by blocking the ciliary nerves.\n [1] \n\n\nIndications\nRetrobulbar block is used for any ophthalmic surgery or procedure requiring globe anesthesia and akinesia.\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nAbsolute contraindications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nHypersensitivity or allergy to local anesthetic\n\n\n\n\nOrbital infection or significant inflammation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative contraindications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased axial length of the globe\n\n\n\n\nBleeding diathesis\n\n\n\n\nThyroid-associated orbitopathy\n\n\n\n\nSpace-occupying lesion within the orbit\n\n\n\n\nPrevious scleral buckling\n\n\n\nFor increased axial length of the globe, many physicians will use 25 mm as a cutoff, although this exceeds the point at which a retrobulbar block should not be performed.\n\nMany physicians will still perform a retrobulbar block even in the setting of aspirin or warfarin use.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nMuscle Cone\n\nThe extraocular muscles form a cone about the globe. The apex is at the optic foramen and the base is formed by the insertions of the muscles to the globe.\n\nA matrix of connective tissue forms the intermuscular septum. In addition to further separating extraconal and intraconal space, this controls the spread of anesthetic injected into the orbit.\n\nStructures located within the cone (after passing through the annulus of Zinn) include the motor innervations to the rectus muscles (cranial nerves III and VI) and the afferent sensory fibers from the globe, which are carried by the short and long posterior ciliary nerves before joining the nasociliary nerve (a branch of cranial nerve V1).\n\nMotor Innervation\n\nCranial nerve VI (abducens) innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Cranial nerve IV (trochlear) innervates the superior oblique muscle. Cranial nerve III (oculomotor) innervates all other extraocular muscles.\n\nWhile cranial nerves III and VI pass within the cone, cranial nerve IV travels outside of the muscle cone to innervate the superior oblique muscle. It is likely affected by the retrobulbar block through diffusion of the anesthetic.\n\nThe motor nerves enter the rectus muscles on the intraconal surface.\n\nSensory Innervation\n\nAfferent fibers from the globe travel via the long and short posterior ciliary nerves. These fibers pass through the intraconal ciliary ganglion.\n\nThe fibers then join the nasociliary nerve, which is a branch of the superior division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The saphenous nerve is a cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve originating from the L2-L4 nerve roots. It descends anteroinferiorly through the femoral triangle, lateral to the femoral sheath, accompanying the femoral artery in the adductor canal, and then courses between the sartorius and gracilis muscles across the anterior thigh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescent of the saphenous nerve down the anteromedial aspect of the leg. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAfter piercing the deep fascia on the medial aspect of the knee, the nerve courses superficially down the anteromedial lower leg.

The saphenous nerve travels to the dorsum of the foot, medial malleolus, and the area of the head of the first metatarsal. At the level of ankle, the saphenous nerve is found between the medial malleolus and the anterior tibial tendon, just lateral to the saphenous vein.\n\nSee the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaphenous nerve dermatome of the anteromedial leg. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaphenous nerve dermatome at the level of the foot. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Scalp Anesthesia": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe scalp is an envelope of 5 separate soft tissue layers that combine to cover the skull. It stretches from the supraorbital margins on the anterior aspect to the external occipital protuberance of the posterior aspect of the skull. It contains a thick layer of skin (within which is contained hair and sebaceous glands), connective tissue, epicranial aponeurosis, loose areolar tissue, and the pericranium. \nThe skin, connective tissue, and aponeurosis are bound together in one single unit that slides atop the areolar tissue. The aponeurosis comprises the underside of the skin-connective tissue unit and serves as the insertion site for the muscles of the scalp. The pericranium is a thin fascial layer fixed to the outer portion of the skull. It is continuous with the endosteum of the skull bones, so subperiosteal hematomas typically take the shape of the skull bones underlying the bleeding. \n\n\nA mnemonic device for remember these layers is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nS - Skin\n\n\n\n\nC - Connective tissue & cutaneous vessels & nerves.\n\n\n\n\nA - Aponeurosis (epicranial aponeurosis)\n\n\n\n\nL - Loose areolar tissue\n\n\n\n\nP - Pericranium (periosteum of skull bones)\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn image depicting scalp anatomy can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScalp anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nBlood supply to the scalp comes from both the internal and external carotid arteries, and these arterioles anastomose randomly along the connective tissue plane of the scalp. Because these vessels are contained within the connective tissue, compromise of the vessels that would typically lead to vasospasm elsewhere in the body is prevented by the rigid tissue, leading to the classical large volume bleeding associated with scalp lacerations. \n\nNerve supply of the scalp comes from the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal), as well as the cervical plexus. The forehead is innervated by branches of the V1 division, specifically the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves. The vertex and lateral region of the scalp receives its nerve supply from the V2 and V3 divisions (zygomaticotemporal, and temporomandibular and auriculotemporal nerves, respectively). The posterior scalp sensation is supplied by the greater auricular and occipital nerves. All of these nerves become superficial (and accessible to anesthetic access) above an imaginary line drawn from the occipital protuberance to the eyebrows, passing along the upper border of the ear. In the scalp, the nerves travel between the connective tissue and aponeurosis.\n [2] \n\nSee Scalp Anatomy for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Subarachnoid Spinal Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nSubarachnoid (spinal) block is a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia when the surgical site is located on the lower extremities, perineum (eg, surgery on the genitalia or anus), or lower body wall (eg, inguinal herniorrhaphy). Because of the technical challenges of readily identifying the epidural space and the toxicity associated with the large doses of local anesthetics needed for epidural anesthesia, spinal anesthesia was the dominant form of neuraxial anesthesia well into the 20th century.\n [1] \n\n\nSubarachnoid block can be used as the sole source of anesthesia. Alternatively, spinal and epidural anesthesia can be used jointly, taking advantage of the qualities of both techniques: the rapid, dense sensorimotor blockade of a spinal anesthetic and the opportunity to redose the patient with an epidural catheter anesthetic.\n [2] \nSpinal anesthesia produces intense sensory and motor blockade as well as sympathetic blockade. As opposed to epidural anesthesia, in which medications are instilled outside the dura mater, the goal of spinal anesthesia is to instill the desired medications into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The sensorimotor block produced requires smaller doses of local anesthetics (hence, local anesthetic toxicity is rarely a concern) and is often more dense in character.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the focus of this topic is subarachnoid block, comparison with epidural anesthesia may be informative. For instance, brief periods (less than 24 hours) of postoperative analgesia can be facilitated by adding an opioid to the local anesthetic injected into the cerebrospinal fluid. Prolonged postoperative analgesia is best ensured by insertion of an epidural catheter, using an opioid and local anesthetic combination infused continuously over the first few postoperative days. See the table below for a comparison of subarachnoid and epidural anesthesia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Cesarean deliveries are routinely performed under spinal anesthesia, as are total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty.\n [3, 17, 4] \n\nAdvantages include avoidance of general anesthesia and the airway management concerns that accompany general anesthesia. However, that is not to suggest that spinal anesthesia is always the best course in a patient likely to have difficulties with endotracheal intubation. All patients with difficult airways, no matter what anesthetic plan is chosen, should have a well thoughtout plan for airway management, should it be needed.\n\nAdditional benefits may include reducing the metabolic stress response to surgery, reduction in blood loss, decrease in the incidence of venous thromboembolism, reduction in pulmonary compromise (particularly in patients with advanced pulmonary disease), and the ability to monitor the patient’s mental status.\n\nContraindications\nStrong contraindications include patient refusal, lack of patient cooperation, difficulties with positioning, and increased intracranial pressure. Other contraindications include situations that require some risk-benefit analysis include hypovolemia, coagulation disturbances, stenotic valvular disease, bacteremia, and infection at the site of needle insertion.\n\nSpinal anesthesia has also been noted to result in symptomatic deterioration in patients with multiple sclerosis.\n [5] Patients with chronic low back pain may decline spinal anesthesia out of concerns for increased low back pain. Performing spinal anesthesia in patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease or a prior history of lumbar surgery may prove technically difficult, but these are not necessarily contraindications.\n\nAllergy to local anesthetics may also be a contraindication, but true allergies are usually found with ester-based local anesthetics (eg, tetracaine), not the amide-based local anesthetics (eg, bupivacaine), so finding a suitable local anesthetic is not challenging.\n [6, 7] \n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nAlthough one-shot injection techniques are the norm, continuous spinal anesthesia has enjoyed periods of popularity while also being demonized. In the early 1990s, spinal microcatheters (27-G) were introduced but were followed by an increased incidence of postoperative cauda equina syndrome.\n [8] In cases in which cauda equina syndrome developed postoperatively, microcatheters were used; in response to an unsuitable rise in anesthetized dermatomal levels, unusually large of doses of local anesthetics (usually lidocaine) were administered to effect a sufficient spinal anesthetic.\n\nWhat may have happened was that insufficient turbulence was created through injection through the microcatheter, the local anesthetic pooled distally in the lumbar intrathecal space (below the natural lumbar lordosis), and with repeated local anesthetic doses, administered in hopes of advancing the dermatomal level of local anesthetic effect, toxic local anesthetic levels were created in the region of the cauda equina.\n\nContinuous spinal techniques may be regaining a slow resurgence in popularity, but patients should be carefully chosen. Instead of microcatheters, larger conventional epidural catheters should be used. Because of the larger rent in the dura, postdual puncture headache is an increased risk; therefore, patients who are less likely to have postdual puncture headache, such as older patients, are better candidates. The wisdom that excessive doses of local anesthetics are best not injected into the intrathecal space has been hard earned.\n [9] \n\nProcedure Planning\n\nWith any sympathectomy, blood pressure is expected to decrease secondary to increased venous capacitance and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. Incidence of hypotension is estimated at 35%. Bradycardia secondary to blockade of sympathetic-mediated cardioaccelerator nerves (T1-T4) may contribute to decreased cardiac output. The incidence is around 13%, and bradycardia is more likely to be found in children or adults with baseline heart rates less than 60 per minute and may be reversed with the anticholinergic medications atropine or glycopyrrolate.\n\nEven in patients with ischemic heart disease, cardiac output appears maintained.\n [10] It is important but as yet unclear what level of blood pressure is appropriate under subarachnoid block. As this remains unclear, practitioners will invariably choose to support the patient’s blood pressure through use of vasopressor medications (the mixed alpha- and beta-agonist ephedrine and/or the alpha-agonist phenylephrine) and intravenous fluids. However, the value of intravenous fluid resuscitation in supporting blood pressure has been in dispute.\n [11] Perhaps because of the rapid redistribution of crystalloid out of the intravascular space, preloading the patient with these solutions may have minimal benefit for prevention hypotension. Prehydration with colloid solutions may be more effective. In a study of pregnant patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for cesarean section, having patients sit up for 5 minutes before placing them supine reduced requirements for intravenous fluids andephedrineanddecreased nausea, vomiting and dyspnea.\n [12] \n\nTidal volumes tend to remain unchanged during subarachnoid block, although expiratory reserve is diminished secondary to paralysis of abdominal musculature. The gut is contracted due to unopposed parasympathetic activity. Hyperperistalsis may contribute to nausea and vomiting but, perhaps more commonly, nausea and vomiting are indicators of hypotension. Renal function is preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Regional blocks have several advantages compared to local infiltration, such as fewer injections required to attain adequate anesthesia, smaller volume of anesthetic required, and less distortion of the wound site.\n [1] Because of the lower number of injections, this procedure is better tolerated by the patient and limits the chance of a needle stick injury to the provider.\n\n\nThis procedure, often overlooked in the emergency department, is safe, is relatively easy to perform, and can provide excellent anesthesia to the foot.\n [2, 3, 4] In one study, regional anesthesia of the foot and ankle, when performed by surgeons, was completely successful 95% of the time.\n [5] \nAnatomy\nUnderstanding the anatomical distribution of the superficial peroneal nerve is helpful in performing a successful blockade of this nerve. The superficial peroneal nerve arises from the common peroneal nerve, which also gives rise to the deep peroneal nerve. The superficial peroneal nerve originates between the peroneus longus muscle and the fibula. It courses down the lateral compartment of the lower leg along with the peroneus longus muscle and the peroneus brevis muscle. It then descends posterolaterally to the anterior crural intermuscular septum. It runs anterolateral to the fibula between the peroneal muscles and the extensor digitorum longus, eventually supplying the peroneal muscles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the distal third of the leg, it pierces the deep fascia to become superficial. The nerve splits into the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve and the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve, which give rise to the dorsal digital nerves. These nerves supply the skin of the anterolateral distal third of the leg, most of the dorsal foot, and the digits. However, this nerve does not supply the web space between the first and second digits or the lateral fifth digit.

        "Supraclavicular Nerve Block": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe supraclavicular block was introduced into clinical practice in Germany by Kulenkampff in 1911. Kulenkampff’s recommendation was to advance the needle toward the first rib, in the direction of the spinous process of T2 or T3, which carries an inherited risk for pneumothorax. The high pneumothorax risk was responsible for the technique falling into disfavor. With several modifications, the supraclavicular approach remained a popular choice until the early 1960s.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nEventually, with the combined effect of pneumothorax fear and the introduction of the axillary approach in 1949, the supraclavicular block fell out of favor. In 1978, La Grange described the use of the Doppler probe to identify arteries, which helps to locate the brachial plexus. Kapral et al expanded that idea with the first described ultrasound imaging of the brachial plexus in the supraclavicular position and the needle insertion under ultrasound guidance. Vincent Chan then described the use of both ultrasound and nerve stimulation to perform the block.\n\n\nAll upper extremity blocks involve the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus arise from the anterior rami of C5-8 and T1 with some contribution from C4 and T2. The rami unite to form superior, middle, and inferior trunks. They occupy the space between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Each trunk divides into anterior and posterior divisions, which rejoin to form 3 cords: lateral, posterior, and medial. The medial brachial cutaneous and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves come of the medial cord. The cords then pass into the axilla and divide into nerve branches: the musculocutaneous, axillary, radial, median, and ulnar nerves (see the image below). The brachial plexus can be blocked anywhere along its course, from the neck to the axilla.\n\n\n\n\n\nNerve branches. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Supraorbital Nerve Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe supraorbital nerve block is often used to accomplish regional anesthesia of the face because it offers several advantages over local tissue infiltration. A nerve block often achieves anesthesia with a smaller amount of medication than is required for local infiltration. In addition, unlike local tissue infiltration, nerve blocks can provide anesthesia without causing tissue distortion. Therefore, the supraorbital nerve block is a convenient alternative for situations such as facial lacerations in which tissue distortion would be unacceptable.\nIn general, regional anesthesia is ideal when the area of interest is innervated by one superficial nerve.\n [1, 2] The supraorbital nerve supplies sensory innervation to the upper eyelid, forehead, and scalp, extending almost to the lambdoidal suture (see image below). Since the supraorbital nerve provides a considerably large area of sensory innervation, it is a prime candidate for a regional nerve block.

Regional blocks have several advantages compared to local infiltration, such as fewer injections required to attain adequate anesthesia, smaller volume of anesthetic required, and less distortion of the wound site.\n [1] Because of the lower number of injections, regional block is better tolerated by the patient and limits the chance of a needle stick injury to the provider.

Avoid needle insertion through infected skin or a skin lesion. Be sure to use a sterile technique during the procedure, as the risk of infection is insignificant when sterility is properly maintained.\n\nIntra-arterial injection\n [7]  may result in vasospasm and lead to ischemia of the limb tissue. Intravenous injection can lead to systemic toxicity in high doses. Tissue texture changes revealing pallor, bogginess, and cool temperature may indicate that either intravascular injection or vascular compression has occurred. Always aspirate prior to injection and every 3-5 cc to ensure that intravascular placement has not taken place. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists (eg, phentolamine 0.5-5 mg diluted 1:1 with NaCl 0.9%) can be administered by local infiltration to relieve arterial vasospasm secondary to intra-arterial injection.\n [8] \n\nPatients may develop paresthesia, sensory deficits, or motor deficits secondary to inflammation of the nerve. Most often, this type of neuritis is transient and resolves completely. During the procedure, pull back gently after inducing a paresthesia to avoid an intraneural injection. Make sure to document a complete neurovascular examination both before and after the procedure.\n [9] \n\nReports of significant hemorrhage during sural nerve blockade are rare since this block is superficial and in a compressible area.\n [10] A hematoma may develop with intravascular puncture. If prolonged bleeding occurs, apply direct pressure and elevate the limb.\n\nAllergic reactions to local anesthetics occur at a rate of 1%.\n [8, 11] Reactions range from delayed hypersensitivity (type IV) to anaphylactic (type I).\n [12] Although rare, the most common cause of such allergic reaction is the preservative in the local anesthetic solution. Preservative-free lidocaine (found in cardiac preparations) is an alternative because it does not contain the preservative. Alternatively, a 1-2% diphenhydramine solution can be used as a local anesthetic.\n [8] \n\nThe dose of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine should not exceed 5 mg/kg. If lidocaine with epinephrine is used, total dose should not exceed 7 mg/kg. Systemic toxicity manifests in the central nervous and cardiovascular systems.\n [11, 13] Signs such as tremors, convulsions, tachycardia, or respiratory compromise should alert the physician to stop the procedure and reassess the patient. One should be familiar with the LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity) protocol and have intralipid readily available. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Techniques of Local Anesthesia for Prostate Procedures and Biopsies": "\nIntroduction and History\n\n\nTransrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy is one of the most common procedures performed by urologists. Since its introduction in 1989, there have been numerous efforts to optimize the patient experience by providing more effective local anesthesia.\n [1, 2] \nInjection of a local anesthetic into the perineum was standard when transperineal prostate biopsy was routine, but this was abandoned when TRUS biopsy became the standard. Since the rectal mucosa was neither easily accessible for direct injection nor considered sensate above the dentate line, some urologists felt that procedural anesthesia was no longer imperative.\n [3] \n\n\nHistorically, biopsies involved taking a limited number of cores from an identified nodule. After the sextant approach was described in 1989 by Hodge et al, it soon became the standard.\n [4] Once patients had undergone extraction of their sixth needle-core biopsy, many of them reported pain.\nOver time, the number of cores routinely collected increased to between 8 and 14, with many individuals noting significant discomfort. Although some providers continued to assert that prostate biopsy was a painless procedure, up to 96% of patients disagreed. In one study, 1 in 5 patients said that they would refuse to undergo the procedure again without anesthesia.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nExperienced providers may attest that less effort is required to obtain patient acceptance for an initial prostate biopsy than for a repeat procedure. Published data has suggested that nearly one-third of patients refuse to undergo a repeat biopsy because of the pain experienced previously.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1996, Nash et al described the use of a periprostatic nerve block (PPNB) at the time of biopsy.\n [6] However, until Soloway and Obek published a corroborating study in 2000,\n [7] few urologists opted to change their approach. Over 45 studies have now validated PPNB as an effective technique to improve patient comfort during biopsy.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nA normal prostate volume for an adult male is approximately 25 cc, and continues to grow throughout a man’s lifetime secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The gland is located posterior to the pubic symphysis, inferior to the bladder, and anterior to the rectum. The base of the prostate is in continuity with the bladder neck and contains the prostatic urethra. The gland continues inferiorly to its apex, just above the membranous urethra which is surrounded by the striated external urethral sphincter.\n\nThe anal canal is situated between the anal verge (anal orifice, anus) and the rectum. The transition between the rectum and the anal canal is observed at the dentate line. For surgeons, however, the demarcation between the rectum above and the anal canal below is the anorectal ring. The length of the (surgical) anal canal is about 3–5 cm, with two thirds located above the dentate line and one third below (anatomical anal canal).\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Prostate Anatomy and Anal Canal Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Testicle and Epididymis Anesthesia": "\nOverview\n\n\nEmbryology\nAnesthesia of the testicle and epididymis is best understood starting from the embryological origin of the respective structures. The testes are embryologically derived from the same level as the kidneys and, therefore, share a common level of innervation, that being the T10-L1 level for pain conduction and T10-L2 for sympathetic innervation. As the fetus matures, the testes descend into the scrotum. The scrotum is innervated anteriorly by the ilioinguinal and genitofemoral nerves, while the posterior portion of the scrotum is innervated by the perineal branches of the pudendal nerves. Anatomy is shown in the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the urogenital system. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpermatic cord and adjacent structures. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe afferent fibers for the internal contents of the scrotum run in the spermatic cord. It is at this site that an anesthetic nerve blockade is best approached, as the nerves are relatively superficial to the skin as they run through the spermatic cord. With a relatively noninvasive and simple technique, anesthesia of the testicles and epididymis can be achieved.\n\n\n\n\nIn the images below, note that the nerves that are involved with the innervation of the scrotal sac include the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves and the genitofemoral nerves, along with a branch of the pudendal nerve on the posterior surface of the scrotal sac. Therefore, administration of local anesthetic to the spermatic cord itself, while establishing anesthesia of the testicle and epididymis, does not establish anesthesia of the overlying skin.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnervation of the male urogenital system. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestis innervation. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Therapeutic Injections for Pain Management": "\nTypes of Therapeutic Injections\n\n\nThis article focuses on the use of therapeutic injections (see the image below) to treat acute and chronic pain syndromes. Discussion of this topic begins with an overview of regional anesthesia, which includes the pharmacology of frequently administered medications and basic information regarding equipment and safety. The spectrum of injection procedures and their indications for specific pain disorders and pathoanatomic regions is addressed to include therapeutic options for the various tissues or structures characteristic of each area or syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral view showing needle position of lumbar paravertebral somatic block technique. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nSee Pain Management: Concepts, Evaluation, and Therapeutic Options, a Critical Images slideshow, to help assess pain and establish efficacious treatment plans.\nThe following anatomical divisions are somewhat arbitrary and overlap in some cases; however, this mode of presentation should prove relevant and accessible by using a format to address pain complaints by region and target tissues located in the spine, extremities, head and face, autonomic nervous system, and some viscera. A discussion of the clinical use of botulinum toxin is incorporated at the end of the article. \n\n\n\n\nNeural blockade and similar injection procedures often are prescribed for therapeutic benefits; however, they also can be useful for diagnostic, prognostic, or prophylactic indications, or for a combination of these purposes. \n\n\n\n\nTherapeutic blocks are appropriate for alleviating acute pain, especially in a self-limiting disorder (eg, postoperative, posttraumatic, or acute visceral pain syndromes). In general, they have been advocated to alleviate acute pain or an exacerbation of chronic pain and to provide direct and localized therapeutic action, especially in patients in whom pain is accompanied by swelling and inflammation. They help the patient (1) maintain an ambulatory or outpatient treatment status; (2) maintain participation in a physical therapy or rehabilitation program; (3) decrease the need for analgesics; and (4) in some cases, avoid or delay surgical intervention. \n\nSympathetic blocks in causalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (ie, complex regional pain syndromes) permit more effective application of adjunctive treatment techniques including physical therapy and medication. In some cases, therapeutic injections help the practitioner gain patient cooperation, which may have been compromised not only by pain but also by fear, poor nutrition, and deconditioning. \n\nDiagnostic blocks often help the treating practitioner determine the anatomic origin(s) of the patient's pain. These procedures also may facilitate differentiation of a local from a referred somatic pain source, a visceral from a somatic pain source, or a peripheral from a central etiology. Selective blocks can help determine which peripheral tissues are primary pain generators. In cases of presumed complex regional pain syndromes, neural blockade can be used to establish relative contributions of somatic and sympathetic nervous systems. \n\nPrognostic blocks are intended to provide information regarding the efficacy of a planned neurolytic or neurosurgical ablative procedure or potential surgical outcomes. These blocks also may help the practitioner and patient decide whether to proceed with surgery or ablative procedures. \n\nProphylactic blocks are used to delay and reduce postoperative pain, to prevent complications caused by posttraumatic or visceral pain, to decrease the duration of hospitalization and convalescence, and to prevent development of certain chronic pain syndromes such as autonomic dystrophy and phantom limb pain. \n\nFor patient education resources, see the patient education articles Chronic Pain, BOTOX® Injections, and Pain After Surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation": "\nOverview\n\n\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) currently is one of the most commonly used forms of electroanalgesia. Hundreds of clinical reports exist concerning the use of TENS for various types of conditions, such as low back pain (LBP), myofascial and arthritic pain, sympathetically mediated pain, bladder incontinence, neurogenic pain, visceral pain, and postsurgical pain. Because many of these studies were uncontrolled, there has been ongoing debate about the degree to which TENS is more effective than placebo in reducing pain.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nThe image below depicts a TENS unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator). Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. \n\nSee Pain Management: Concepts, Evaluation, and Therapeutic Options, a Critical Images slideshow, to help assess pain and establish efficacious treatment plans.\n\n\n\n\nThe currently proposed mechanisms by which TENS produces neuromodulation include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPresynaptic inhibition in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord\n\n\n\n\nEndogenous pain control (via endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins)\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nDirect inhibition of an abnormally excited nerve\n\n\n\n\nRestoration of afferent input\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of laboratory studies suggest that electrical stimulation delivered by a TENS unit reduces pain through nociceptive inhibition at the presynaptic level in the dorsal horn, thus limiting its central transmission. The electrical stimuli on the skin preferentially activate low-threshold, myelinated nerve fibers. The afferent input from these fibers inhibits propagation of nociception carried in the small, unmyelinated C fibers by blocking transmission along these fibers to the target or T cells located in the substantia gelatinosa (laminae 2 and 3) of the dorsal horn. \n\nStudies show marked increases in beta endorphin and met-enkephalin with low-frequency TENS, with demonstrated reversal of the antinociceptive effects by naloxone.\n [6] These effects have been postulated to be mediated through micro-opioid receptors. Research indicates, however, that high-frequency TENS analgesia is not reversed by naloxone, implicating a naloxone-resistant, dynorphin-binding receptor. A sample of cerebral spinal fluid in those subjects demonstrated increased levels of dynorphin A. \n\nThe mechanism of the analgesia produced by TENS is explained by the gate-control theory proposed by Melzack and Wall in 1965.\n [7] The gate usually is closed, inhibiting constant nociceptive transmission via C fibers from the periphery to the T cell. When painful peripheral stimulation occurs, however, the information carried by C fibers reaches the T cells and opens the gate, allowing pain transmission centrally to the thalamus and cortex, where it is interpreted as pain. The gate-control theory postulates a mechanism by which the gate is closed again, preventing further central transmission of the nociceptive information to the cortex. The proposed mechanism for closing the gate is inhibition of the C-fiber nociception by impulses in activated myelinated fibers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Transvaginal Pudendal Nerve Block": "\nOverview\n\n\nBlocking the pudendal nerve with injection of local anesthetic is used for vaginal deliveries and for minor surgeries of the vagina and perineum. Use of this nerve block for vaginal delivery was reported as early as 1916.\n [1] However, the procedure did not become popular until 1953-54, when Klink and Kohl implemented the modified technique.\n [2, 3] \nThe sensory and motor innervation of the perineum is derived from the pudendal nerve, which is composed of the anterior primary divisions of the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves. The pudendal nerve’s 3 branches include the following: \n\n\n\nDorsal nerve of clitoris, which innervates the clitoris\n\nPerineal branch, which innervates the muscles of the perineum, the skin of the labia majora and labia minora, and the vestibule\n\nInferior hemorrhoidal nerve, which innervates the external anal sphincter and the perianal skin\n\n\n\nA pudendal nerve block targets the pudendal nerve trunk as it enters the lesser sciatic foramen, about 1 cm inferior and medial to the attachment of the sacrospinous ligament to the ischial spine. Here, the nerve is medial to the internal pudendal vessels. This nerve is accessed by 2 approaches, transvaginal and transcutaneous (or perineal). The former approach is more reliable and is used most often, except when an engaged head makes vaginal palpation more difficult.

        "Ambulatory EEG": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nAmbulatory electroencephalography (AEEG) monitoring is a relatively recent technology that allows prolonged electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in the home setting.\n [1] Its ability to record continuously for up to 72 hours increases the chance of recording an ictal event or interictal epileptiform discharges. AEEG is a less expensive alternative to inpatient monitoring, with costs that are 51-65% lower than a 24-hour inpatient admission for video/EEG monitoring.\n [2] \n\n\nContinuous cardiac monitoring was first described by Holter in 1961.\n [3] The development of portable EEG recording proved more problematic than the Holter monitor because of the need for signal amplification and multichannel recording. A multichannel portable recorder was developed in the early 1970s. This technology was later adapted to EEG recording, and miniature preamplifiers that could be worn on the head were developed.\n [4, 5] \nEarly clinical investigations documented the ability of AEEG to record identifiable focal and generalized epileptiform activity.\n [6, 7] In 1982, Ives introduced a 16-channel AEEG that utilized signal multiplexing.\n [8] The 16 channels allowed improved spatial resolution and localization but recorded discrete samples rather than continuous EEG.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1983, a cassette tape AEEG system was introduced; it used off-head preamplifiers that had continuous 8-channel recording capability, real-time identification, and gain and filter adjustments.\n [9, 10, 11, 12] \n\n\n\n\nIn the past decade, computer technology has enabled portable recording of up to 36 channels with sampling rates of up to 400 Hz. Currently, numerous AEEG systems are available commercially (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of an ambulatory EEG system. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIndications\nAEEG has several important clinical applications.\n [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Depending on the clinical suspicion, other diagnostic tests (eg, ambulatory cardiac monitoring, polysomnography [PSG] or inpatient video/EEG monitoring\n [18, 19] ) may be more appropriate in a given situation.\n\nConfirmation of clinical suspicion of epilepsy\nA clinical suspicion of epilepsy can be confirmed by recording a seizure on AEEG.\n [20, 21] This is most likely to occur when the patient is experiencing daily or almost daily spells. Studies looking at the diagnostic yield of AEEG indicate that 6-15% of AEEGs record seizures.\n\nHigher yields have been reported from 16-channel AEEG with computer-assisted seizure detection than from older 4- or 8-channel systems without seizure-detection algorithms.\n [22, 23, 24, 25] A 2001 study in which 502 patients were evaluated with computer-assisted 16-channel AEEG demonstrated that 8.5% of patients had a seizure during the recording period (mean, 28.5 h).\n [26] \n\nIn patients with intractable epilepsy, AEEG has been used to localize seizure onset as part of presurgical evaluation.\n [27] However, inpatient video/EEG monitoring remains the standard for presurgical evaluation.\n\nEvaluation of interictal epileptiform activity\nDetection of interictal epileptiform abnormalities in the absence of recorded seizures can provide supporting evidence for a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that 34.9% of patients with known seizures had a positive AEEG, whereas 15.3% of 216 patients in whom the diagnosis of seizures was considered (ie, patients with episodic alterations of behavior, perception, sensation, or motor functioning) had interictal epileptiform abnormalities on 4-channel AEEG. When a 16-channel recorder was used, 38% of patients who were referred for AEEG had some type of epileptiform abnormality.\n\nAEEG is highly specific; spikes were found on overnight AEEG in only 0.7% of asymptomatic adults without a history of migraine or a family history of epilepsy.\n [28] In patients with a history of migraine headaches and those with a family history of epilepsy, the incidence of spikes on AEEG was 12.5% and 13.3%, respectively.\n\nSome patients in whom epilepsy is suspected have a normal routine or sleep-deprived EEG. In these patients, AEEG can increase the chance of detecting an epileptiform abnormality. Of patients who previously had normal or nondiagnostic routine EEG, 12-25% have epileptiform activity on AEEG.\n\nA study comparing the usefulness of sleep-deprived EEG and computer-assisted 16-channel AEEG in patients with suspected epilepsy (but a nondiagnostic initial routine EEG) found that sleep-deprived EEG improved detection of epileptiform discharges by 24%, whereas AEEG improved detection by 33%.\n [29] Of the 46 patients studied, 15% had actual seizures recorded on AEEG, and none had seizures during the sleep-deprived recording.\n\nPatients may have epilepsy without interictal epileptiform abnormalities on EEG, but this occurs in fewer than 20% of patients. In a study using a 4-channel recording system, 3 patients had only seizures recorded without interictal abnormalities. AEEG with 16 or more channels increases the probability that interictal epileptiform abnormalities will be found.\n\nDocumentation of seizures of which patients are unaware\nFor a patient to have seizures and yet be unaware of them is not uncommon.\n [30, 31] Brief alterations of awareness occur in both absence and complex partial seizures. AEEG is helpful at identifying seizures that are unrecognized or unreported by the patient.\n\nAbsence seizures may be so brief that the patient is unaware of them. A study using AEEG to evaluate absence seizures in pediatric patients found that most paroxysms of generalized spike and wave discharges (see the image below) were asymptomatic.\n [32] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn 8-second burst of generalized 3-Hz spike and wave captured on an ambulatory EEG. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPatients with complex partial epilepsy are often amnestic for their seizures. The sequelae of a nocturnal generalized convulsive seizure, if present at all, may be so subtle (eg, fatigue, muscle soreness) that the patient is unsure whether a seizure actually occurred.\n\nA study of patients in an epilepsy monitoring unit found that 63% of all seizures were unrecognized by the patients. This difficulty in identifying the occurrence of seizures impedes seizure diagnosis and assessment of treatment adequacy.\n\nLiporace et al found that the AEEGs of 3 patients (of 46) demonstrated seizures that were not designated as events by the patients.\n [29] Tatum et al found that more than one third of AEEGs with ictal activity contained at least one seizure that was unreported by the patient.\n [26] These studies demonstrate the utility of AEEG at capturing unsuspected events.\n\nEvaluation of response to therapy\nBecause a significant number of patients are unaware of their seizures, responses to treatment are frequently difficult to gauge. Patients with mental retardation or other forms of encephalopathy may be unable to report seizures accurately. In such cases, AEEG can have a significant impact on clinical management.\n\nAEEG is particularly useful in quantitating response to the treatment of absence seizures. If untreated, such seizures typically occur numerous times per day; adequate treatment usually normalizes the EEG.\n\nEvaluation of nocturnal or sleep-related events\nCertain diagnoses are difficult to confirm with the typical 20-minute outpatient EEG. The interictal epileptiform discharges of benign rolandic epilepsy, for example, are highly activated by sleep and may not always be achieved adequately in a laboratory. Continuous spike and wave activity during slow-wave sleep is another entity that may demonstrate a relatively normal EEG during waking hours and a strikingly abnormal EEG during deep sleep.\n\nBecause of its capacity to record an entire night of sleep, AEEG is invaluable in assessing these clinical situations. Another advantage is that children can be monitored at home.\n [33] \n\nIf a nonepileptic sleep disorder is suspected, PSG is the preferred study because of the added information from monitoring electromyography (EMG), eye movements, electrocardiography (ECG), and respiration.\n\nThe history may not differentiate clearly between a sleep disorder and epilepsy. AEEG may record frequent arousals (suggesting sleep apnea) or decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency (suggesting narcolepsy). In a study of 500 patients who had AEEG, narcolepsy was suggested in 6 patients, including 3 in whom narcolepsy had not been suspected.\n\nEvaluation of suspected pseudoseizures\nPseudoseizures, also known as psychogenic seizures or nonepileptic events,\n [34] are clinical events in which patients perceive altered movement, emotion, sensation, or experience similar to those due to epilepsy but without an electrographic ictal correlate.\n [35, 36, 37, 38] \n\nPseudoseizures are surprisingly frequent, occurring in as many as 20% of patients at epilepsy referral centers and in 5-20% of outpatient populations. Some patients have both pseudoseizures and epileptic seizures; coincident events occur in an estimated 10-60% of epilepsy patients.\n\nAEEG can be a useful screening tool in identifying patients who have nonepileptic paroxysmal events. In one study, 36% of patients had event marker activations without associated electrographic changes.\n\nPotential problems exist in using AEEG to definitively diagnose nonepileptic seizures. A 24-hour recording without associated video does not allow evaluation of clinical stereotypy, which is valuable when evaluating patients with unusual seizure manifestations and minimal EEG changes. Scalp EEG may not show electrographic ictal abnormality during some frontal lobe seizures or may show only subtle abnormalities that would be difficult to interpret without associated video.\n\nKanner et al found that 25% of their group of 12 patients with supplementary motor seizures demonstrated no electrographic ictal pattern during seizures.\n [39] \n\nSeizures and nonepileptic seizures may be associated with movement and muscle artifact that may obscure the underlying EEG. Although AEEG may be a useful initial screening tool for nonepileptic events, inpatient video/EEG monitoring remains the criterion standard in evaluating nonepileptic seizures.\n\nEvaluation of syncope\nAEEG may be helpful in evaluating syncope or near-syncope if an ECG lead replaces 1 of the EEG channels.\n [40] If cardiogenic syncope is suspected, a Holter monitor or prolonged cardiac event monitor may be more useful clinically. Although arrhythmias have been diagnosed with continuous ambulatory EEG/ECG recording, a study of epileptiform abnormalities in AEEG found that only 1 of 67 patients with syncope, near-syncope, or episodic dizziness had an epileptiform abnormality.\n\nFuture applications\nSeizure anticipation methods are under development to identify EEG changes before seizure onset, allowing ongoing assessment of the probability of seizure occurrence.\n [41, 42, 43, 44, 35, 45, 46, 47, 48] With further characterization of EEG changes in the preictal state, future AEEG recording may be coupled with a seizure anticipation device, providing a time window within which therapeutic intervention may prevent a seizure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Amygdalohippocampectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nThis article discusses the indications for selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) and the surgical techniques used to perform it.\n\n\nEpilepsy is a common condition that affects nearly 1% of the world’s population. Although about two thirds of patients with epilepsy achieve good seizure control with antiepileptic medications, the remaining one third have seizures that are resistant to medications and therefore may be considered as candidates for epilepsy surgery. In suitable candidates, surgical therapy is clearly superior to the best medical therapy.\n [1] \nSurgery is most often considered and most frequently successful in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Most patients with TLE have seizures that originate from the mesial-basal temporal lobe structures (hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus). Traditionally, the standard surgical treatment has been an en bloc anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL).\n\n\n\n\nATL involves resection of approximately 3-6 cm of anterior temporal neocortex (depending on language dominance), which permits the surgeon to access and resect mesial structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus. A modification popularized by the Yale group limits neocortical resection to 3.5 cm from the temporal pole and spares the superior temporal gyrus, obviating the need for language mapping in most cases.\n [2, 3] \n\n\n\n\nThe primary advantages of ATL are the relatively low morbidity and the good surgical exposure that allows complete resection of mesial structures; this procedure also permits pathologic examination of en bloc specimens. ATL is still commonly used today.\n\nData from animal models and from pathologic, electrophysiologic, and structural and functional imaging studies support the contention that most temporal lobe epilepsy arises from mesial temporal structures. This suggests the possibility that more targeted mesial temporal resections that spare temporal neocortex (eg, SAH) might provide equally good seizure control and result in fewer neuropsychological sequelae than ATL (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of anterior temporal lobectomy and selective amygdalohippocampectomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn 1958, Niemeyer reported such a procedure, using a small incision in the middle temporal gyrus to access the temporal horn and selectively resect mesial temporal structures.\n [4] Subsequently, Wieser and Yasargil popularized a transsylvian approach and reported outcomes of large numbers of patients who underwent this procedure.\n [5, 6] Other techniques, including the subtemporal approach\n [7] and variants of the transcortical approach, have been described.\n [8] \n\nMany individual studies suggest that for patients with well-defined mesial temporal onset seizures, particularly those with the syndrome of hippocampal sclerosis, seizure-free outcomes after SAH are equivalent to outcomes after procedures that involve more extensive temporal neocortical resections.\n [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] A systematic review and meta-analysis suggested a slight advantage in seizure-free rates in patients who underwent ATL; however, methodological concerns from combining potentially biased studies have strengthened the call for a randomized controlled trial of SAH versus ATL for treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.\n [15, 16, 17] \n\nPresuming near equivalence in seizure-free outcomes, SAH would be preferred over ATL if it could be clearly demonstrated that the more selective procedure would result in superior postoperative neuropsychological outcomes. Here, the results have been mixed.\n\nAlthough many studies suggest that SAH can spare some aspects of cognitive function as compared with ATL,\n [5, 18, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 11, 24] others have reported mixed findings and have not shown the more selective procedure to provide a clear benefit.\n [25, 26, 27, 28] SAH can still cause significant verbal memory impairment in some cases of dominant temporal lobe resection, and it does not eliminate the need for careful preoperative evaluation (including assessment of risk to memory function).\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe cerebrum is the largest component of the brain. It is divided into right and left hemispheres. The corpus callosum is the collection of white matter fibers that joins these hemispheres.\n\nEach of the cerebral hemispheres is further divided into 4 lobes: the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. The medial temporal lobe structures are considered by some to be part of the so-called limbic lobe.\n\nThe limbic system is a grouping of cortical and subcortical structures involved in memory formation and emotional responses. The limbic system allows for complex interactions between the cortex, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem. The limbic system is not defined by strict anatomic boundaries but incorporates several important structures. The limbic structures conventionally include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the fornix, the mammillary bodies, the cingulate gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Brain Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nMost commonly, suitable candidates for SAH are selected on the basis of the convergence of several lines of evidence implicating unilateral mesial temporal structures as the epileptogenic region. These lines of evidence include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatible ictal semiology and neurologic history\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing abnormality in the mesial temporal structures (most commonly, hippocampal atrophy and/or mesial temporal signal change on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] sequences); patients with exclusively mesial temporal foreign tissue lesions (eg, low-grade tumor) or neurodevelopmental abnormalities may also be suitable candidates\n\n\n\n\nVideo electroencephalography (EEG) documenting compatible ictal semiology and stereotyped ictal onset on scalp EEG consistent with mesial temporal origin; interictal EEG may reveal concordant unilateral or bilateral (usually predominantly ipsilateral) epileptiform discharges\n\n\n\nFor patients in whom these lines of evidence do not converge, or for whom some data points are lacking (eg, those with no MRI lesion or with poorly localized ictal onsets on EEG), additional studies may be required, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nPositron-emission tomography (PET)\n\n\n\n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG)\n\n\n\n\nIctal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)\n\n\n\nParticularly in nonlesional cases, if standard evaluation, supplemented by specialized imaging studies, defines a unilateral temporal lobe onset, intracranial EEG monitoring may be required for distinguishing mesial from temporal neocortical onset so as to determine whether SAH is indicated.\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to SAH include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nNonepileptic events\n\n\n\n\nIdiopathic (primary) generalized epilepsies\n\n\n\n\nExtratemporal focal epilepsy\n\n\n\n\nIndependent bitemporal onset seizures (in most cases)\n\n\n\n\nSevere impairment of verbal and visuospatial memory (as demonstrated by neuropsychological testing and intracarotid amytal testing)\n\n\n\n\nTemporal neocortical epilepsy\n\n\n\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy without clear localization to mesial temporal structures\n\n\n\nTechnical Considerations\nCareful attention to surgical technique will lead to better technical results and reduced complication rate.\n\nBest practices\nThe following measures are recommended in the performance of SAH:\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate from \"safe zone\" to \"safe zone\"\n\n\n\n\nUse neuronavigational guidance frequently, particularly during the early learning curve\n\n\n\n\nEstablish routine way points for surgical image-guided navigation\n\n\n\n\nThe initial subpial dissection should be aimed inferiorly and anteriorly so that the middle fossa floor is encountered first\n\n\n\n\nWork from the anterior to the posterior uncus, carefully exposing the pia\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the choroid plexus, then the choroidal fissure\n\n\n\n\nNever extend the resection superior to the choroidal fissure\n\n\n\n\n\"Box out\" the region superior to the choroidal fissure with a flat self-retaining retractor to prevent inadvertent injury\n\n\n\n\nUse 2 retractors, one on the choroid plexus retracting superiorly to prevent injury superior to the fissure and the other in the ventricle to expose the posterior pes hippocampi\n\n\n\n\nWork posteriorly to mobilize the hippocampus from the fissure, then divide the pes hippocampi posteriorly to coincide with the anteroposterior location of the collicular plate on axial guidance MRI\n\n\n\n\nDissect the parahippocampal gyrus from posterior to anterior to liberate the pes\n\n\n\n\nCarefully mobilize the pes hippocampi based on the hippocampal fissure, avoiding injury to any perforating arteries\n\n\n\n\nObtain absolute hemostasis.\n\n\n\n\nLine the medial pial boundary with thrombin-soaked gelatin sponge (eg, Gelfoam) and oxidized cellulose fabric on the resection bed proper\n\n\n\nComplication prevention\nPotential complications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nHemorrhage\n\n\n\n\nInfarction (commonly of deep penetrating vessels, leading to lacunar stroke)\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n\n\n\n\nFailure of neuronavigation protocols, leading to inaccurate resection\n\n\n\n\nIncomplete resection\n\n\n\n\nVariable contralateral homonymous superior quadrant visual field defect, from injury to the Meyer loop (usually asymptomatic)\n\n\n\n\nMemory impairment\n [29] \n\n\n\n\nTransient dysnomia\n\n\n\n\nMood changes\n\n\n\nIntraoperative complications can be minimized by strict adherence to timeout procedures, careful patient positioning, and careful visual identification of landmarks coupled with repeated reconfirmation of stereotactic findings.

        "Anterior Cervical Discectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAnterior cervical discectomy (ACD) was described in the mid-20th century as a treatment for lateral cervical disc syndrome.\n [1, 2] This procedure involved removing the symptomatic disc from an anterior approach without placement of a bone graft. Early studies demonstrated fusion rates that were similar to those of procedures using bone graft.\n [2, 3] Multiple larger studies have also shown the ACD procedure to be safe and effective.\n [4, 5] \nWith the advent of ACD, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) techniques were simultaneously and independently popularized by Cloward\n [6] and Smith and Robinson.\n [7] ACDF similarly involves removing the symptomatic cervical disc with an added step of placing bone graft to encourage bony fusion of the upper and lower vertebral body. This added step has been argued to further encourage cervical fusion to maximize stability and maintain disc space height to decrease the likelihood of foraminal stenosis.\n [8] However, placement of a bone graft also introduces potential complications of graft dislodgement and failure, as well as donor-site complications if autograft is used. Nonetheless, the ACDF technique has been found to have excellent long-term clinical outcomes.\n [9, 10] \n\n\nThe anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with instrumentation (ACDFI) technique involves the additional stabilization of the cervical spine with instrumentation. Early instrumentation involved wiring techniques. This was largely modified to cervical plate technology after their introduction and application in the 1980s.\n [11] Design has subsequently improved to now include constrained, nonconstrained, rotational, rigid, and dynamic plate subtypes\n [12] . Argued benefits of plate instrumentation include reduced graft dislodgements, increased fusion rates, and decreased foraminal stenosis. However, as with the introduction of bone graft, the additional placement of hardware introduces hardware-related complications.\nSince their introductions, heated debates have compared ACD, ACDF, and ACDFI. Prospective randomized controlled trials have been performed that demonstrate similar clinical outcomes between the 3 groups, with a decreased rate of cervical fusion and increased incidence of kyphosis in the ACD group.\n [3, 13, 14, 15] Guidelines were also published in 2009.\n [16] Proponents and detractors for these different procedures can be found throughout the scientific and surgical community.\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this article is not to compare and contrast these different surgical techniques or plate technologies but to highlight the role of these 3 procedures for treatment of cervical spine disease.\n\n\n\n\nKey considerations\nAs mentioned above, ACD, ACDF, and ACDFI are different but very similar techniques for the surgical treatment of cervical spine disease. This article discusses the differences between these techniques.\n\nWhen referring to the ACDFI technique, various plate technologies exist. These can be roughly categorized as rigid versus dynamic versus rotational, nonconstrained versus constrained, and rotational plating systems. Recent biodegradable and single-screw-per-vertebral body systems have also been introduced. The nuances of these plating systems are not discussed in this article.\n\nWhen referring to the bone graft techniques, namely ACDF and ACDFI, surgical choices of using autograft and allograft exist. The differences between these types of bone graft are not discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

For over half a century, frame-based stereotactic methods have proven their use, and, more recently, frameless stereotaxy has emerged as a valuable alternative to this.

The anterior approach to the cervical spine was developed in the 1950s by Robinson and Smith,\n [1] Bailey and Badgley,\n [2] and Cloward.\n [3] However, the posterior approach to the cervical spine remained the preferred choice of many spinal surgeons until the 1980s, when Meyer reported on the management and treatment of traumatic cervical spine fractures through the anterior approach.\n [4] For more information, see Approach Considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral radiograph shows a two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion from C 4/5 through 6/7.

        "Cervical Laminectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nCervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is caused by reduction of the sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal canal. Normally, the canal diameter in the subaxial cervical spine is approximately 17-18 mm in adults.\nCSM may result from congenital or degenerative changes in the cervical spine.\n [1] It is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults older than 55 years, as well as acquired spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis in adults.\n [2, 3] Risk factors for CSM include cigarette smoking, frequent lifting, and diving.\n\n\nThe degenerative changes occur in the 5 articulations that comprise the cervical motion segment: the intervertebral disc, the two facet joints, and two false uncovertebral joints of Luschka. Normal aging of the spine results in loss of disc height, which in turns brings the uncovertebral joints into contact, thereby distorting the normal biomechanics. Consequently, osteophyte formation, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and facet/uncovertebral joint eburnation occur. Disc space collapse also causes a rostral-caudal translation, which in turn magnifies laxity of the joint capsules and ligamentum flavum with further degeneration.\nDegenerative changes occur most commonly at C5-6 and C6-7. White and Punjabi classified these changes as “static” factors, a category that also includes congenital spinal canal stenosis (< 13 mm anterior-posterior diameter) and disc herniation. Dynamic factors, on the other hand, are those that exert abnormal forces (translation and/or angulation) on the spinal column during flexion and extension under normal physiological conditions.\n\n\n\n\nFlexion can increase spinal cord compression in the presence of disc protrusions or vertebral osteophytes, which in turn causes stretching of the spinal cord. Extension can increase spinal cord compression by infolding of ligamentum flavum or facet joint capsules, which causes shortening and thickening of the spinal cord. The infolding may be exaggerated if there is simultaneous occurrence of loss of disc space height.\n\n\n\n\nThe natural history of CSM is one of progressive disability. Clark and Robertson asserted that, once the disorder was recognized, neurological function did not return to normal. CSM may also result from spinal cord ischemia caused by compression spinal arteries, arterial feeders, or obstruction to venous outflow.\n\nA subset of pathologies may also lead to reduction of the diameter of the cervical spinal canal. These include spinal cord contusions secondary to trauma, intracanal (intradural, extradural, or intramedullary) neoplasia, syringomyelia, and hemorrhage (epidural or subdural). Spinal cord contusions, intramedullary neoplasia, and syringomyelia produce symptoms owing to their intrinsic nature within the spinal cord, frequently resulting in expansion of the spinal cord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression": "\nBackground\n\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a term that encompasses numerous specific treatment approaches for various psychiatric disorders. As the name suggests, cognitive-behavioral treatments incorporate both cognitive and behavioral strategies. With regard to depression, CBT refers to the use of both cognitive restructuring and the behavioral strategy of activity scheduling or behavioral activation.\nCognitive-behavioral approaches to the treatment of depression stem from early behavioral treatments that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. Among the most prominent was Lewinsohn et al’s behavioral treatment for depression.\n [1] Lewinsohn proposed that depression resulted from deficient response contingent positive reinforcement, which he reported was a function of the following 3 factors:\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual differences in what is experienced as reinforcing\n\n\n\n\nThe availability in the individual’s environment of potentially reinforcing events\n\n\n\n\nThe skill level needed to obtain reinforcement\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if someone found conversing with others to be reinforcing, had other individuals available with whom to converse, and possessed the social skills needed to engage one of those individuals in conversation, then he or she could experience positive reinforcement. Lewinsohn’s treatment, therefore, aimed to increase depressed individuals’ ability to obtain response-contingent positive reinforcement and therefore improve their mood; he did this by having them identify and engage in events they described as having been, or potentially being, pleasurable and addressing skills deficits that may preclude them from obtaining the desired reinforcement from identified pleasant events. Numerous depression treatments that included activity scheduling emerged during the 1970s and 1980s.\n [3, 4, 1, 5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nAlthough early versions of activity scheduling primarily focused on increasing mood-related pleasant events, Beck incorporated a form of activity scheduling into his cognitive therapy for depression, aimed at increasing both pleasant events and providing a sense of accomplishment or mastery (eg, working on a resume, completing a school assignment).\n [7] Following a component analysis of cognitive therapy that found this activity scheduling component to be as effective as the full treatment package,\n [8] interest in behavioral treatments for depression increased, leading to modern approaches called behavioral activation (BA) treatments.\nModern BA approaches are based on the same principles as early versions of activity scheduling but incorporate more sophisticated strategies for identifying activity assignments and addressing barriers to their completion.\n [9, 10] Several meta-analyses have examined studies of activity scheduling and BA approaches over the past several decades and have provided substantial empirical support for these approaches.\n [11, 12, 13] \n\n\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, cognitive treatments for depression began to gain in popularity and empirical support, with the most well-known being Beck et al’s cognitive therapy for depression.\n [7] Cognitive therapy is based on the fundamental assumptions that (1) cognitive activity affects behavior, (2) cognitive activity can be monitored and changed, and (3) cognitive changes can lead to desired behavioral changes.\n [14] Cognitive therapy emphasizes the need to change cognitions in order to achieve improvements in mood and behavior. As mentioned above, Beck’s cognitive therapy for depression includes activity scheduling treatment strategies adapted from earlier behavioral interventions but also includes cognitive strategies such as cognitive restructuring that were designed to directly challenge and change maladaptive thoughts.\n\nAlthough behavioral approaches typically do not include any direct attempts to change cognitions (but attempt to indirectly do so through changes in behavior), cognitive therapy does directly attempt to change behavior but does so for the ultimate goal of changing cognitions in order to reduce depressive symptoms. Therefore, at times, such approaches may be called either cognitive therapy or CBT, with both incorporating behavioral and cognitive interventions.\n\nWithin the CBT model, individuals with depression are viewed as exhibiting the “cognitive triad” of depression, which includes a negative view of themselves, a negative view of their environment, and a negative view of their future.\n [15] Related to the cognitive triad, depressed patients are believed to exhibit numerous cognitive distortions that maintain these negative beliefs.\n [7] Examples of these distortions include all-or-nothing thinking (ie, viewing things in black and white categories), overgeneralization (ie, assuming one negative event constitutes a pattern of never-ending negative events), and fortune telling (ie, making negative predictions about the future that are often inaccurate or negatively biased).\n [16] Within Beck’s model, negative automatic thoughts and distortions in thinking are hypothesized as stemming from problematic schemas, which are cognitive structures that influence how information is interpreted and recalled.\n [17, 7] Schemas are often targeted in the later phases of treatment, whereas behavioral strategies and efforts to elicit and test automatic thoughts are implemented earlier in treatment.\n [15] Elaboration of specific treatment strategies is presented below.\n\nBecause CBT for depression is a broad category that includes numerous treatment strategies, different aspects of treatment may be emphasized to a greater or lesser extent in practice. In general, however, CBT for depression includes specific behavioral strategies (ie, activity scheduling) as well as cognitive restructuring aimed at changing negative automatic thoughts.\n\nCBT for depression has been examined in numerous clinical trials and has received empirical support across various settings and populations.\n [18, 19, 20, 21] \n\nBeck’s cognitive therapy for depression has been listed as a well-established treatment by the American Psychological Association’s Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures since its inception in 1993. Several meta-analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT for depression.\n [22, 23, 24, 25] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Craniotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe term \"craniotomy\" refers broadly to the surgical removal of a section of the skull in order to access the intracranial compartment. The portion of skull temporarily removed is called a bone flap, and it is placed back in its original position after the operation is completed, typically fastened into place with low-profile titanium plates and screws. \"Craniectomy\" refers to an operation wherein the bone flap is removed but not replaced.\nA craniotomy is named for the specific region of the skull where the bone is removed. For example, if the craniotomy is opened in the frontal bone, it is called a frontal craniotomy. Among the more common craniotomies in addition to the frontal include the parietal, temporal, occipital, and suboccipital. One of, if not the most common craniotomy site is referred to as \"pterional.\" The pterional craniotomy is named for the pterion, the junctional point of 4 bones within the skull (frontal, temporal, greater wing of sphenoid, parietal).\n\n\nIf a craniotomy involves 2 contiguous regions of the skull, it is named for both regions (eg, frontotemporal craniotomy, also rendered as fronto-temporal craniotomy); if 3 regions are involved, all names are included in the description (eg, a frontotemporoparietal craniotomy).\nCraniotomies that involve the use of MRI-based navigational software, which has become standard in nearly all planned craniotomy operations, are referred to as “stereotactic” craniotomies. \"Stereotactic\" is a generic term and does not specify the location of the craniotomy site.\n\n\n\n\nSmaller craniotomies are often referred to as \"keyhole” craniotomies and are used in situations that require less bone removal. As the accuracy of navigational software has improved, along with advances in surgical technique and visualization, these keyhole craniotomy approaches have become more commonplace.\n [1] An example of such a minimally invasive craniotomy is the supraorbital craniotomy, also more coloquially known as an \"eyebrow\" craniotomy, in which the incision and bone flap are placed in the region of the patient's eyebrow.  \n\n\n\n\nThe smallest type of craniotomy is technically a “burr hole,” also known as trephination. This is less regarded as a true craniotomy and more so as its own category of surgical approach, since it provides an extremely limited view of the underlying brain. However, with the advent of the endoscope, a long and thin high-definition camera, the burr hole serves as the entry port for the endoscope in a variety of intracranial approaches. Creating a burr hole involves drilling a small hole into the skull, revealing the underlying dura mater, the outermost of the 3 meninges covering the brain. The dura can then be opened to allow further exploration of the underlying brain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Discography": "\nOverview\n\n\nDiscography was first described in 1948 as an investigative technique for herniated nucleus pulposus. Since that time, new imaging techniques that are more appropriate for this diagnosis have been developed. Discography is currently used to determine whether the disk is the source of pain in patients with predominantly axial back or neck pain.\n [1] \nDuring discography, contrast medium is injected into the disk and the patient's response to the injection is noted; provocation of pain that is similar to the patient's existing back or neck pain suggests that the disk might the source of the pain. Computed tomography (CT) is usually performed after discography to assess anatomical changes in the disk and to demonstrate intradiscal clefts and radial tears. \n\n\nEarly studies suggested that discography had a low specificity, but more recent studies have failed to induce pain in asymptomatic controls, suggesting that discography has utility in identifying patients with discogenic pain. Pain reproduction during discography in symptomatic individuals is variable, with a lower incidence of pain reproduction in patients with disk degeneration than in those with posterior tears of the anulus fibrosus or significant disk bulges. \nControlled clinical trials of discography are lacking, and a standard against which to compare is elusive. When comparing outcomes of fusion procedures, lumbar discography is sensitive but lacks specificity.

        "Dystonia Treatment using Botulinum Toxin": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nDystonia is a disorder characterized by involuntary sustained muscle contractions resulting in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Classification of dystonia is based on age of onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, and presence or absence of associated symptoms. Several types of dystonia based on bodily distribution have been described, including focal, segmental, hemidystonia, multifocal, and generalized dystonia.\n [1] Despite an incomplete understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying dystonia, botulinum toxin (BTX) has proven to provide relief of dystonic posturing associated with pain and discomfort. Since the introduction of BTX therapy in the late 1980s, it has become the standard therapy for focal dystonia. Efficacy is determined by muscle selection and adequate dosing. BTX has been proven as an effective and safe long-term treatment option for dystonia.\n [2] \n\n\nBTX is one of the most potent biologic substances known. The seven distinct serotypes, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, are of similar sizes and structures. However, the serotypes differ in their potency, duration of action, and cellular target sites. Types A and B have proven safe and effective in double-blind clinical trials for dystonia treatment. One formulation of BTX-A is marketed worldwide under the name BOTOX® (Allergan Inc.) and another in Europe as Dysport (Speywood, UK). BOTOX® was approved in December 1989 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for \"the treatment of strabismus, blepharospasm, and focal spasms including hemifacial spasm\" and more recently for the treatment of cervical dystonia. Since then it has been widely used in neurology, urology, gastroenterology, and neuro-rehabiliation in pain management.\nA formulation of BTX-B was approved in December 2000 by the FDA for the treatment of cervical dystonia. It is marketed under the name Myobloc in the United States and Neurobloc in Europe (Elan Pharmaceuticals). Based on 2016 AAN guidelines, there is Level A (effective) evidence for the use of specific serotypes of BTX in cervical dystonia, upper and lower limb spasticity, and chronic migraines, and Level B evidence in blepharospasm.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this, a new mosaic-type toxin known as BoNT/HA (also termed BoNT FA or H) was reported. BoNT/HA has 84% identical receptor binding domain (Hc) of BoNT/A but responds differently to some potent BoNT/A neutralizing antibodies.\n [3, 4] \n\n\n\n\nThe clinician must recognize that the various commercial formulations of BTX differ in the dosages used clinically owing to differences in potency and diffusion (see next 2 sections).\n\nThe various botulinum toxins possess individual potencies, and care is required to ensure proper use and avoid medication errors. Recent changes to the established drug names were intended to reinforce these differences and prevent medication errors. The products and their approved indications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnabotulinumtoxin A (Botox, Botox Cosmetic)\n\n\n\nBotox - Cervical dystonia, severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis, strabismus, blepharospasm, upper and lower limb spasticity (adults), upper limb spasticity (children 2 y or older), overactive bladder, urinary incontinence, migraine headache\n\nBotox Cosmetic - Moderate-to-severe glabellar lines, lateral canthal lines\n\n\n\n\n\nAbobotulinumtoxin A (Dysport) - Upper and lower limb spasticity (adults), lower limb spasticity (children 2 y or older), cervical dystonia, and moderate-to-severe glabellar lines in adults; it is also indicated for lower limb spasticity in children aged 2 years or older\n\n\n\n\nIncobotulinumtoxin A (Xeomin) - Cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, upper limb spasticity (adults), glabellar lines\n\n\n\n\nRimabotulinumtoxin B (Myobloc) - Cervical dystonia\n\n\n\nBotulinum toxin type A\nBTX proteins have been studied since the early 1900s, initially to gain an understanding of botulism, a form of food poisoning. Later, they were studied because of the unique and specific muscle paralysis induced by minute amounts of the toxins. During the past 30 years of work on the use of the toxin for human treatment, selective procedures for the production, purification, and dispensing of the toxin have been developed to make it suitable for injection. Today BTX-A is employed and considered safe and effective for the treatment of movement disorders and spasticity. One of the more common movement disorders treated with BTX-A is focal dystonia. The most common types are cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, hand dystonia, oromandibular dystonia, occupational dystonia, and laryngeal dystonia.\n\nThe administration of BTX therapy for focal dystonia requires a thorough understanding of the toxin itself and practical knowledge of typical dosages and anatomy, along with basic electromyographic skills. The optimal dose of BTX is the least amount needed to achieve a predetermined outcome (decreased muscle tone, improved range of motion, improvement of certain active function, improved hygiene) without causing an adverse effect such as weakness.\n [5] \n\nBTX type A inhibits release of acetylcholinesterase (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. Following local injection into muscles, the toxin enters the nerve terminal via endocytosis, interacts with intracellular proteins (soluble N -ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor [SNARE] proteins), and inhibits the vesicular release of the Ach neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction.\n [6, 7] This chemical denervation results in paralysis of the striated muscles, which usually peaks 2 weeks after the injection. Some nerve terminals are not affected by the toxin, allowing the injected dystonic muscle to contract. Because of the molecular turnover within the neuromuscular junction and neuronal sprouting, neuronal activity begins to return in an average of 3 months, with restoration of complete function at approximately 6 months.\n [8] \n\nMany factors affect the dose of BTX including severity and chronicity of the disease, number of muscles involved, previous response to BTX, concurrent other medical therapy used, and the experience of the person performing the injection. Smaller doses are used in children, proportionate to the body mass.\n\nStructure\nBTX is synthesized as a single-chain peptide with a molecular mass of 150 kilodaltons. This form has relatively little potency as a neuromuscular blocking agent, and activation requires a 2-step modification in the protein's tertiary structure. This process converts the single-chain neurotoxin to a di-chain neurotoxin comprising a 100,000-dalton heavy chain (HC) linked by a disulfide bond to a 50,000-dalton light chain (LC). BTX acts at the neuromuscular junction where it exerts its effect by inhibiting ACh release from the presynaptic nerve terminal.\n\nACh is contained in vesicles, and several proteins (VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin) are required to mediate fusion of these vesicles with the axon terminal membrane. BTX binds to the presynaptic terminal via the HC. The toxin is then internalized and the HC and LC are separated. The LC from BTX-A cleaves SNAP-25, the LCs from serotypes B and F cleave VAMP, and that from serotype C cleaves syntaxin. This disrupts ACh release and subsequent neuromuscular transmission, resulting in weakness of the injected muscle.\n\nOther medications used to treat focal dystonia\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nBotulinum toxin injections\n\n\n\n\nBenzodiazepines\n\n\n\nClonazepam\n\nLorazepam\n\nDiazepam\n\n\n\n\n\nBaclofen\n\n\n\n\nAnticholinergics\n\n\n\nTrihexyphenidyl\n\nBenztropine\n\n\n\n\n\nDopamine-depleting agents\n\n\n\nTetrabenazine\n\nClozapine\n\n\n\n\nOptimum goals of treatment with botulinum toxin\nThe goal of BTX treatment is to achieve a balance between weakness sufficient to reduce spasm but insufficient to interfere with function. The best combination of reduction in dystonia and pain with optimization of function should be sought.\n\nBotulinum toxin type B for dystonia\nMyobloc (Elan Pharmaceuticals) was approved by the FDA in December 2000 for treatment of patients with cervical dystonia to reduce the severity of associated abnormal head position and neck pain. BTX-B also has received marketing authorization from the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products and will be marketed as Neurobloc (Elan Pharmaceuticals).\n\nReported clinical studies have shown Myobloc/Neurobloc to be a safe and effective treatment for cervical dystonia in patients who have responded to BTX-A and in those who developed resistance to BTX-A. As with all the botulinum toxins, BTX-B acts at the neuromuscular junction inhibiting the release of ACh at the presynaptic membrane; however, the primary mechanism of action of BTX-B differs from that of BTX-A, as BTX-B inactivates a different protein involved in the release of ACh.\n\nIn a multicenter study of 100 patients with cervical dystonia, Jankovic et al examined the immunogenicity of botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B). They correlated the clinical response with the presence of blocking antibodies (Abs) using a novel mouse protection assay. One-third of the patients who were negative for BTX-B Abs at baseline became positive for BTX-B Abs at last visit, suggesting that the high antigenicity of BTX-B limits its long-term efficacy.\n [9] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nMost of the skeletal muscular system is arranged into groups of agonists and antagonist muscles that work in concert to provide efficient and controlled motion. This is achieved through the complex interaction of the musculoskeletal system with the pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and sensory components of the nervous system.\n\nIn gross anatomy, the nerves to skeletal muscles are branches of mixed peripheral nerves. The branches enter the muscles about one third of the way along their length, at motor points. Motor points have been identified for all major muscle groups for the purpose of functional electrical stimulation by physical therapists, in order to increase muscle power. Only 60% of the axons in the nerve to a given muscle are motor to the muscle fibers that make up the bulk of the muscle. The rest are sensory in nature, although the largest sensory receptors, the neuromuscular spindles, have a motor supply of their own.\n\nA motor unit comprises a motor neuron in the spinal cord or brainstem together with the squad of muscle fibers it innervates. In large muscles (eg, the flexors of the hip or knee), each motor unit contains 1200 or more muscle fibers. In small muscles (eg, the intrinsic muscles of the hand), each unit contains 12 or fewer muscle fibers. Small units contribute to the finely graded contractions used for delicate manipulations.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Muscular System Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "EEG Video Monitoring": "\nOverview\n\n\nEEG-video monitoring refers to continuous EEG recorded for a more or less prolonged period with simultaneous video recording of the clinical manifestations. Having a correlation of the recorded behavior (video) and the EEG activity, the diagnosis of seizures or nonepileptic attacks can be made definitely in nearly all cases. EEG-video is the criterion standard for the diagnosis.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nEEG-video monitoring has become available at most large referral centers with an epilepsy program, and more recently in many smaller hospitals and on an outpatient basis. As a general rule, prolonged EEG-video monitoring should be obtained on any patient who continues to have frequent seizures despite antiepileptic drugs.\n [5] \n\n\nThe purpose of EEG-video is to answer the following questions:\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the episodes epileptic seizures?\n\n\n\n\nIf not, what are they?\n\n\n\n\nIf they are epileptic seizures, what type of epilepsy is it?\n\n\n\n\nIf the seizures are focal, from where are they arising?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Electroconvulsive Therapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been demonstrated to be an effective and safe treatment for many psychiatric disorders.\n [1] The use of ECT still generates significant controversy, however. It has been negatively portrayed in movies such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, House on Haunted Hill, and Requiem for a Dream.\n [2] \n\n\nDespite such debate, ECT is widely used in the United States and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA).\n [3]  Professional associations in Austria, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, and India have offered professional guidelines for its use.\n [4]  Efficacy rates for the use of ECT in populations of treatment-resistant depression patients exceed 85%, eclipsing all other treatments for severe depression.\n [5]  In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration reclassified ECT devices from Category III (higher risk) to Category II (moderate risk) when used in severe depressive episodes and catatonia.\n [6] \nThe image below depicts electroconvulsive therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, catatonia, schizophrenia, and several other conditions. ECT uses an electric current to cause a seizure in the brain and is one of the fastest ways to treat severe symptoms of mental illness. It should be considered when a patient does not improve with medication or psychotherapy or when the severity of symptoms is life-threatening. \n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1934, the Hungarian neuropathologist Ladislas Joseph von Meduna began the modern era of convulsive therapy by using intramuscular injection of camphor and pentylenetetrazol to treat catatonic schizophrenia. This approach was dubbed chemical convulsive therapy (CCT).\n [7]  In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Lucio Bini and neurologist Ugo Cerletti performed the first electrical induction of seizures in a catatonic patient and produced a successful treatment response. Their electrical stimulation of the ictal response was more reliable than chemical stimulation. Initially the approach was given a variety of names, but the term electroconvulsive therapy was eventually identified as the leading nomenclature. Lothar Kalinowsky, one of Cerletti's assistants, left Italy in 1939 and performed the first ECT in the United States in 1940.\n [8] \n\nIn 1978, the APA published the first Task Force Report on ECT, with the goal of establishing standards for consent and the technical and clinical aspects of the conduct of ECT.\n [9]  In 1985, the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Mental Health Consensus Conference on ECT endorsed a role for the use of ECT and advocated research and national standards of practice.\n [10] \n\nMechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of ECT is not fully known. ECT affects multiple central nervous system components, including hormones, neuropeptides, neurotrophic factors, and neurotransmitters.\n [11]  \n\nOne theory of ECT efficacy is related to the \"hyperconnectivity hypothesis.\" Functional MRI (fMRI) data suggests that patients with depression experience a localized increase in connectivity within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This hyperconnectivity is decreased in patients treated with ECT in a similar fashion to those individuals treated with chemical antidepressant treatment.\n [12]  \n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) has been used to study the neurophysiological effects of ECT. In a literature review of studies assessing possible changes in cerebral glucose metabolism by PET before and after ECT, reduction in glucose metabolism after ECT in bilateral anterior and posterior frontal areas represented the most consistent findings.\n [13] \n\nNearly every neurotransmitter system is affected by ECT, including adrenergic, serotonin, muscarinic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),\n [14, 15] second-messenger systems, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphisms\n [16] may play a role in ECT. An increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and receptor antagonism has also been observed.\n [17]  Finally, ECT may also lead to an increase of endogenous opioids.\n [18, 19] \n\nAlthough many biomarkers have been studied, no ECT biomarker is routinely used in current clinical practice.\n [15] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nIn the central nervous system, the brain and spinal cord are the main centers where correlation and integration of nervous information occur. Both the brain and spinal cord are covered with a system of membranes, called meninges, and are suspended in the cerebrospinal fluid; they are further protected by the bones of the skull and the vertebral column.\n\nThe central nervous system is composed of large numbers of excitable nerve cells and their processes, called neurons, which are supported by specialized tissue called neuroglia. The long processes of a nerve cell are called axons or nerve fibers. The interior of the central nervous system is organized into gray and white matter. Gray matter consists of nerve cells embedded in neuroglia; it has a gray color. White matter consists of nerve fibers embedded in neuroglia; it has a white color due to the presence of lipid material in the myelin sheaths of many of the nerve fibers. The billions of neurons in the brain are connected to neurons throughout the body by trillions of synapses.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Central Nervous System Anatomy and Brain Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nECT is indicated for selected patients with catatonia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other disorders.\n\nCatatonia\n\nConsidered one of the most lethal psychiatric disorders, few treatments are currently available for the treatment of catatonia. No randomized controlled trials of ECT for the treatment of catatonia exist, likely due to the relative rarity and severity of the condition. Patients who have failed medical treatment with benzodiazepines still have at least an 80% likelihood of response to ECT.\n [20]  World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) clinical guidelines for the treatment of catatonia related to schizophrenia recommend the use of ECT upon failure of benzodiazepines.\n [21] \n\nMajor depressive disorder\n\nECT should be considered for patients in the acute phase of major depressive disorder who have a history of treatment resistance (as defined by greater than two antidepressant trials), high degree of symptom severity, or who have psychotic symptoms.\n [22]  ECT is more effective in patients with psychotic features accompanying their major depressive episode than nonpsychotic patients.\n [5]  ECT may also be the treatment of choice for patients in whom treatment response is urgently needed, such as patients who are acutely suicidal or those who are refusing food and are nutritionally compromised. These considerations of symptom severity should be given regardless of the number of prior antidepressant medication failures.\n [22] \n\nECT may be useful in patients with major depressive disorder for whom medication or psychotherapy has not been effective in maintaining stability during the continuation phase.\n [23, 22]  ECT should be considered in patients whose condition has failed to respond to medication trials, individuals who have not tolerated indicated medications, or those who have previously shown a response to ECT.\n [22]  ECT also should be considered in patients with melancholic and atypical depression.\n [24, 25] \n\nBipolar disorder\n\nECT may be considered for patients in the depressive phase, manic phase, or mixed phase of bipolar disorder,\n [26, 27, 28]  Response rates of depressive symptoms in bipolar patients are similar to unipolar patients, and response rates exceed 70% for the manic phase of the illness.\n [29] ECT also is a potential treatment for those experiencing severe mania or depression during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester when teratogenic risks from traditional mood stabilizing medications may be greater.\n [28, 30] ECT may be efficacious in patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder.\n [31] Mania resulting from ECT is uncommon.\n [1]  \n\nSchizophrenia\n\nECT can be considered an adjunctive biological treatment for schizophrenia in combination with first- or second-generation antipsychotics. While treatment with clozapine should be considered in cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, the use of ECT may benefit patients already receiving antipsychotic medication.\n [32]  In those patients who are already receiving clozapine and experiencing breakthrough symptoms of psychosis, the addition of ECT can have adjunctive benefits.\n [33] \n\nECT may be particularly beneficial if mood symptoms (depression, mania, or suicidal ideation) are present.\n [34] \n\nComorbid disorders\n\nECT is not recommended for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) but may be considered for treating comorbid disorders such as major depressive disorder, mania, and schizophrenia in patients with OCD.\n [35]  The efficacy of ECT in the treatment of core symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is inconclusive.\n [36] \n\nOther disorders and indications\n\nECT has been effective in the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome,\n [37] depression associated with Parkinson disease,\n [38, 39]  and particular cases of delirium,\n [40] It has also been effective in treating patients with intellectual disabilities who have treatment-resistant mood or psychotic disorders.\n [41] \n\nContraindications\nECT has no absolute contraindications. Many medical conditions place patients at an increased risk for complications and warrant closer monitoring, however. In patients with medical comorbidities (discussed below) additional precautions can mitigate any additional risks associated with performing ECT in medically ill populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies": "\nBackground\n\n\nElectrodiagnostic testing encompasses a range of specialized tests, including nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG), that are used to evaluate the conduction of electrical impulses along peripheral nerves. These tests should be considered and performed only after a careful history and physical examination, which are sometimes sufficient to establish a diagnosis of neuromuscular dysfunction without further testing. However, in some cases, the subtlety of sensory or motor deficits necessitates further workup for a conclusive diagnosis.\n [1] \nNerve conduction studies and needle EMG are commonly performed by physical medicine and rehabilitation or neurology specialists to assess the ability of the nervous system to conduct electrical impulses and to evaluate nerve/muscle function to determine if neuromuscular disease is present.\n\n\nNerve conduction studies\nFor this test, a series of surface electrodes are placed at different locations along specific peripheral nerves. The nerve is stimulated at one site and recorded at a different site to determine if the nerve is conducting electrical impulses appropriately.\n\n\n\n\nEach electrical stimulation is recorded as a waveform on a computer and analyzed by the electromyographer performing the test.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nStandard nerve conduction studies typically include motor nerve conduction, sensory nerve conduction, F waves, and H reflexes.\n\nSensory and motor nerve conduction studies involve analysis of specific parameters, including latency, conduction velocity, and amplitude. Onset latency is the time it takes for the stimulus to initiate an evoked potential and reflects the conduction along the fastest fibers. Peak latency is the latency along the majority of axons and is measured at the peak amplitude.\n [3] Both are affected by the state of the myelination of the nerve.\n\nThe conduction velocity along the nerve also depends on the state of myelination and is often decreased in disorders or trauma that affects nerve myelination, although it may be normal if a few myelinated axons remain intact. Reduction of amplitude of recorded responses generally indicates a loss of axons.\n [4] \n\nThese studies, in conjunction with the physical examination and correlation to a set of normative values, assist the electromyographer in diagnosing a multitude of nerve disorders, including entrapment neuropathies, brachial plexopathies, and polyneuropathies.\n\nIt is often important to distinguish between sensory and motor nerves, as certain disease processes can affect one or both. Radiculopathy produces motor deficits but does not affect sensory nerves since the anatomic location of the damage is proximal to the dorsal root ganglion. When a lesion is distal to the dorsal root ganglion, such as in brachial plexopathies, both motor and sensory nerves are affected.\n\nSensory nerve conduction studies\n\nSensory nerve conduction studies are performed via stimulation of a nerve (ie, sufficient to produce an action potential) at one point and measurement of the action potential at another point along the course of the nerve.\n [5] Peripheral sensory nerves can be used to localize a lesion in relation to the dorsal root ganglion that contains the cell body of the nerve, allowing differentiation of preganglionic disorders (eg, radiculopathies, cauda equina lesions, posterior column disease) from postganglionic disorders (eg, neuropathies, plexopathies). With a preganglionic lesion, the sensory nerve action potential is normal (although clinically abnormal) because axonal transport from the cell body to the peripheral axon remains intact.\n [6] \n\nMotor nerve conduction studies\n\nIn motor nerve conduction studies, motor nerves are stimulated and the compound muscle action potential from the muscle is recorded. This corresponds to the integrity of the motor unit. Results of this study can be affected by any process that damages the anterior horn cell body or axon, Schwann cells, the neuromuscular junction, or the muscle cell itself.\n [7] Also analyzed are the size, shape, and morphology of the compound muscle action potential to determine the state of myelination, the number of functioning muscle fibers, and the function of the neuromuscular junction. Since the cell body of motor nerves is located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the motor nerve conduction is abnormal in both preganglionic and postganglionic injuries.\n\nLate responses\nDistal nerve segments are relatively easy to analyze since they can be studied directly. To study proximal nerve segments, late responses based on conduction along the proximal nerve are used. Late responses include F waves and H reflexes.\n\nF waves\n\nThe F wave is a late response involving the motor axons that can be elicited in most upper and lower extremity muscles. A stimulus is applied to a distal motor nerve that travels antidromically from the peripheral nerve, to the anterior horn cell, and a response fires back down the motor neuron and is recorded as a muscle response that occurs after the compound muscle action potential. F waves tend to have lower sensitivity for radiculopathy but can be useful in the assessment of polyneuropathy.\n\nH reflexes\n\nThe H reflex is basically an electrophysiologically recorded Achilles muscle stretch reflex. It is performed by stimulating the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa. From there, the stimulus goes proximally through the reflex arc at that spinal segment, then distally from the anterior horn cell and the motor nerve. It can be recorded over the soleus or gastrocnemius muscles. The H reflex is most commonly used to evaluate for an S1 radiculopathy or to distinguish from an L5 radiculopathy.\n\nNeedle EMG is used to assess both nerve and muscle function. A small-diameter monopolar pin or coaxial needle is placed into a muscle to evaluate insertional activity, resting activity, voluntary recruitment, morphology, and size of motor units, as well as motor unit recruitment. The needle electrode examination provides valuable information about the electrical characteristics of individual muscle fibers and motor units, as well as the integrity and innervation of muscle fibers. This test can be uncomfortable for the patient.\n\nInsertional activity\n\nInsertional activity is the electrical activity present as the electrode is passed through muscle cells. These are discharge potentials provoked by the disruption of the cell membrane itself. Careful attention is given to the duration and amount of electrical noise after each movement of the needle. This activity is decreased in atrophied muscle or fatty tissue. Conversely, it is also increased in many abnormal conditions that cause membrane instability, such as neuropathies, radiculopathies, and inflammatory myopathies.\n\nSpontaneous activity at rest\n\nResting or spontaneous activity is the electrical activity present when the muscle is at rest and the electrode is not being moved. This includes both normal and abnormal spontaneous activity.\n\nNormal muscle should be silent after the needle is inserted; however, if the needle happens to be near the neuromuscular junction, miniature endplate potentials or endplate potentials may be heard or seen. The most common abnormal spontaneous activity is reported as a gradation of either positive sharp waves (PSWs) or fibrillation potentials on a scale of 1+ (transient but reproducible discharges) to 4+ (abundant spontaneous potentials).\n\nFibrillations result from motor axonal loss that is not balanced by reinnervation. Conditions that cause this include any nerve disorder that affects the motor axon, inflammatory myopathies, and direct muscle injury. Depending on the amplitude of the PSWs and/or fibrillation potentials, the electromyographer can determine how recently the injury to the nerve occurred. Low-amplitude fibrillation potentials suggest that denervation occurred in the remote past, whereas high-amplitude fibrillation potentials suggest an ongoing active denervation process.\n\nVoluntary muscle recruitment\n\nRecording of voluntary recruitment of motor unit action potentials can provide additional information. Reduced recruitment signifies motor axonal loss or functional dropout due to focal demyelination or conduction block. By contrast, increased recruitment with a small voluntary force can be seen with myopathy.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe information gathered from needle EMG is combined with that provided by nerve conduction studies to determine the overall interpretation. The results of the analysis of the collective studies often permits delineation of the type of underlying pathologic process, such as a polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy or entrapment neuropathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, disordered neuromuscular transmission, or myopathic process. In many cases, one diagnosis explains the abnormalities found on the study, but, occasionally, more than one diagnosis is necessary to complete the interpretation of the electrodiagnostic findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "EMG Evaluation of the Motor Unit - Electrophysiologic Biopsy": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe motor unit (MU) is a part of the neuromuscular system that contains an anterior horn cell, its axon, and all the muscle fibers (MFs) that it innervates, including the axon's specialized point of connection to the MFs, the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular system also includes upper motor neuron inputs to the lower motor neuron as well as afferent inputs from the periphery such as position receptors in joints, Golgi tendon organs, and muscle spindles. The result is the ability of the muscle to make various patterns of contraction under the control of the upper motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS).\nIn routine needle-electrode examination (ie, electromyography [EMG]) of voluntary muscle contraction, the electrodiagnostic consultant assesses the signature electrical signal generated by the MUs, termed the MU potential (MUP). This is the current preferred term rather than motor unit action potential because the MUP is not an action potential. It is a compound potential derived from the MF action potentials (APs) of a MU. The MUP can be considered the electrophysiologic analogue, but not equivalent, of the MU.  \n\n\nIn addition, signals generated by individual or non-MU groupings of MFs, termed insertion activity (IA) and spontaneous activity (SA), are assessed. These are patterns of random or rogue sub-MUP activity that may yield important clues in the interpretation of the EMG signal. In electrodiagnosis, consideration of all such data is important, including neurography (ie, nerve conductions), before making a final assessment. The focus of this article is on MUs and the MUPs they generate, particularly in neuromuscular disorders in which remodeling of the MU may occur. To place these concepts in perspective, some review of basic clinical neurophysiologic concepts is necessary. This discussion also is predicated on the assumption that the reader has some basic understanding of EMG.\nBeginning with the pioneering work of Professor Fritz Buchthal and colleagues in the 1950s,\n [1] the technique of EMG in MUP analysis has undergone much refinement. In the last 4 decades, the incorporation  of computers into  electromyograph systems and developments in needle electrodes and instrumentation have given greater capability to the electrodiagnostic consultant. This has created a renaissance in clinical studies of the MU, particularly with the work of Professor Erik Stålberg.\n\n\n\n\nThe formal analysis or quantitation of the MUP signal, termed quantitative analysis (QA), is currently not as cumbersome and time-consuming as in the past. It involves a discipline of quantitating the various features of the MUPs. However, electrodiagnostic consultants have become accustomed to the expedient of subjective assessment of the EMG signal in routine analysis. But there has been a general trend toward utilizing new technology in instrumentation (e.g., the trigger-delay feature in assessing MUPs).\n\n\n\n\nQA is not needed in every clinical study, but careful analysis of the MUAP signal is essential. So why is an understanding of at least the principles of QA important? QA forms the foundation upon which routine subjective assessment of the MUP waveforms is made.\n\nOver the decades, clinicians have become immured with a closed-mindedness that reflexively links the diagnosis to the waveforms (eg, myopathic MUP, neurogenic MUP, BSAPs [brief, small, abundant potentials]). Daube argued against this terminological approach long ago.\n [2] The EMG signal should be assessed in the context of all electrodiagnostic data. A diagnostic impression should not be intended to bias the referring clinician against other reasonable possibilities.\n\nIn every routine EMG study, therefore, a more formal or objective approach to MUP analysis should be made. This is accomplished by the electrodiagnostician training their eye to measure the size, complexity, and stability of the waveforms. This also means not being a passive observer of the waveforms as they race across the screen, but actively manipulating the EMG instrument's settings to elicit more information from the signal (ie, interacting with the instrument). The authors refer to this approach as objective-interactive EMG, a practical compromise to traditional QA.\n [3, 4] \n\nThis article primarily addresses the changes in MUAPs that may be observed in neuromuscular disorders. The approach is intended to correlate the changes in the waveforms with what may be observed in the underlying pathologic changes in the MUs. To do this, the electrodiagnostic consultant must modify their assessment of the waveforms to one more objective than the simple subjective assessment typically performed on routine EMG. The electrodiagnostic consultant must become familiar with the limitations of the instrumentation and be able to interact with the recording equipment, from the level of entry at the recording electrode to its display on the EMG.\n\nTherefore, the goal of objective-interactive EMG is to extract reliable and reproducible information from the waveforms. In determining abnormality, consistency in abnormality should be established, as well as some impression of severity and timing. The latter refers primarily to neurogenic processes where relative staging of chronicity in reinnervation is possible. All electrodiagnostic data, including other studies, such as nerve conductions that are not addressed in this article, must also be considered. Some may consider EMG to be a mature area of investigation and mundane in clinical application. The authors hope this article stimulates the electrodiagnostic consultants to make each study an exciting objective-interactive challenge and to interpret the findings as an \"electrophysiologic biopsy\" of the muscle studied.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

It remains the basic functional element of a skeletal muscle. Conversely, a muscle may be considered a grouping of MUs organized somatopically by their motorneurons in the spinal cord. The image below schematically illustrates 2 MUs in a muscle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromyographic (EMG) evaluation of the motor unit (MU): electrophysiologic biopsy. Schematic shows 2 MUs. A, Muscle fibers (MFs) are shown in side view. The endplate zone is central to the MFs (x). Distal region of the MFs on either side of their endplates is where their action potentials are propagated (y), ie, away from the endplates. B, Schematic representation of A on transverse view (ie, cross-section) demonstrates the overlap of MFs from different MUs and thus overlap in MU territories (of which only a portion is shown). C, MU potential (MUP) is recorded from the endplate region (see A, region x) and is characterized by its initial negative deflection. D, MUP shows the typical triphasic appearance with an initial positive deflection. This implies that it is recorded along the MFs away from the endplate zone (see A, region y) (sensitivity 100 mV per division vertical; sweep 5 ms per division). With permission, copyright P.E. Barkhaus, MD, 2001. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThere is no known polyneuronal innervation of mature human muscle (ie, a MF is not innervated by more than one MN). A MN may supply from 6 to 10 MFs in an extraocular muscle to hundreds of MFs in a large proximal limb muscle such as the biceps brachii.\n [7, 8, 9] The result is a remarkable expansion from controlling unit (ie, MN) to the endpoint of its apparatus (ie, MFs), in both anatomic and physiologic terms. This is termed the innervation ratio. There is minimal data on this with respect to specific muscles ranging from older studies (Feinstein) to more recent studies (Gesslbauer).    \n\nThe endplate is that specialized region between the motor nerve terminal and the MF that mediates neuromuscular transmission (see image above, region x). The endplate zone is well demarcated in bipennate muscle, as shown in the work by Aquilonius et al.\n [10] Some larger limb muscles, such as the tibialis anterior, are multipennate, making the endplate zone more complicated. The endplate region on the MFs contains the acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. When these receptors are successfully activated  the result is an endplate potential. Consequent to the endplate potential, an action potential (AP) is generated that spreads electrotonically down the length of the MF. As the AP travels down the MF membrane, the contractile apparatus is activated in turn.\n\nThe endplate zone in a healthy muscle is fairly homogeneous in that the endplates are usually at the mid portion along the length of the MFs (see image above). This may vary depending on the shape of the muscle.\n [10] Such positioning of the endplates allows greater efficiency in the bidirectional spread of the AP along the length of the MF membrane.\n\nRelatively minimal data are available on MFs in humans. Knowing how MF length was assayed experimentally and differentiating between anatomic length and functional length are important.\n [11] MFs may vary considerably in length from approximately a few centimeters in the biceps brachii to less than 2 cm in smaller distal limb muscles. The configuration of a muscle is complicated further by the spatial arrangement of its MFs (eg, pinnate vs staggered). MFs have AP propagation velocities of 2–6 m/s (mean value 3.7 m/s).\n\nThe composition of a muscle by MF types (see Table 2 below) depends on a muscle's functional demands. The gastrocnemius, which has more of a role in static postural maintenance, tends to be represented more heavily with type S (ie, slow twitch, fatigue-resistant) alpha MNs (see Table 2 below). In contrast, the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand participates in more rapid, phasic movements and has more type FF (ie, fast twitch, fast to fatigue) MNs. Different classification schemes have been offered for MNs and MFs, which also may have some interspecies differences (see Table 2 below).\n [7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15] \n\n\n\nTable 2.

In a larger proximal limb muscle such as the biceps brachii, the MUT has an estimated diameter of 5–10 mm (ie, cross-section) based on scanning EMG studies.\n [17] Data from animals suggest greater dispersion of the MUT in a muscle that also may change in size along the length of the muscle.\n [11] \n\nSFEMG fiber-density measurements in healthy muscle suggest that MFs (see image below, electrode C) are separated by about 300 µm.\n [18] MFs vary in diameter. In the upper and lower extremities, they range approximately 40–50 and 50–60 µm in diameter, respectively. Facial MFs are smaller, approximately 20–30 µm in diameter. Generally, MFs in males are slightly larger than those in females, by about 10%.\n [19] Regardless of the muscle, the inference is that MFs from other MUs separate MFs within the same MU as in a patchy, \"mosaic\" pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromyographic (EMG) evaluation of the motor unit (MU): electrophysiologic biopsy. Schematic compares 3 recording needle electrodes relative to a MU territory in a muscle. The recording surface of the macro-EMG electrode (A) is its cannula, which can extend throughout the MU territory. The concentric needle electrode (B) records from the inner core at its tip. The muscle fibers (MFs) closest to its tip contribute to such features as the amplitude (small semicircle), but it records from a moderate portion of the MU territory (circle). These MFs contribute to the duration feature of the MUP. The single-fiber EMG electrode is the most selective (C), with a recording surface of 25 μm diameter on the side of the needle's shaft. The recording area has a 300 μm radius.

Although an MU is homogeneous for the histochemical type of MF it contains, on routine histologic cross-section of muscle those MFs belonging to individual MUs still cannot be discerned. Newer techniques in quantitative histochemistry suggest a possible diversity in histochemical and biochemical properties even within the MFs of the same MU.\n [7, 8, 20] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromyographic (EMG) evaluation of the motor unit (MU): electrophysiologic biopsy.

Barkhaus, MD, 2001. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe MN exhibits considerable plasticity. Cross-innervation experiments have demonstrated that MFs may change their histochemical type. Fast MUs also may be changed experimentally to slow MUs by constant electrical stimulation, thymectomy, and castration. Exercise training in rats did not change the proportion of MN subtypes (see Table 2 above), which under usual conditions is fixed.\n [21] In the resting state, the MN continues to release quanta of acetylcholine in a random manner (ie, miniature endplate potentials) that is thought to have a trophic effect on muscle.\n\nSubsequent to early development in animals, fast MUs may change to slow MUs with increasing age and body size, presumably in response to increased body weight and hence the need for more type S or tonic MUs. By selective training in which force is generated, MFs may hypertrophy, particularly the type II MFs. Endurance training alone (eg, running) generally does not result in MF hypertrophy. The exact mechanisms of force generation in muscle and the functional connections of the MFs to the extracellular matrix are still incompletely understood.\n [22, 7, 8] \n\nAging produces effects on the MU.\n [23, 24, 25, 26] Elderly individuals typically experience decrease in muscle bulk or sarcopenia. This is probably due to generalized atrophy of individual MFs rather than to a decrease in the total number of MFs. Type II MF atrophy is a frequent change noted in aging. Muscle biopsy of healthy elderly individuals also exhibited evidence of MU remodeling. This was based on the findings of targetoid MFs and mild degrees of MF type grouping.\n [26] \n\nElectrophysiologic evidence of MU remodeling in elderly individuals comes from 3 observations. First, the concentric needle (CN) MUP demonstrates an increase in duration with increased age, though not to any significant degree until the individual is older than 60 years.\n [27, 28] Second, the (muscle) fiber density as measured in SFEMG increases after the sixth decade.\n [18] This is the electrophysiologic analogue to MF type grouping but is based on the MU discharge rather than histochemical grouping. Third, macro-EMG MUP amplitude in the vastus lateralis and anterior tibial muscles becomes larger after the sixth decade.\n [29]  Studies of older indviduals using other techniques such as surface-recorded MUPs suggest a significant decline in numbers of MUs. This is an ongoing caveat in trying to reconcile results between electrophysiological techniques.\n [30] \n\nThese specialized EMG techniques are discussed in the Equipment section below. They collectively demonstrate changes in the MU compatible with reinnervation as suggested by the MF type grouping on muscle biopsy. Hence, these quantitative EMG and histologic findings suggest a drop out of MNs as aging proceeds beyond the fifth decade. Data from investigators counting motor axons in anterior roots support the concept of MN loss,\n [23] though dying back of motor axons cannot be excluded.\n\nHomogeneity is found in the MFs supplied by a given alpha MN. Hence, a type I (ie, S alpha MN) has only histochemical type I MFs in its MU (see image below). If an MF is orphaned (eg, denervated), it assumes the characteristics of the MN, subsequently reinnervating it. Therefore, under such conditions, a histochemical type I MF may become a type II, or vice versa. During development, one neuron supplies a terminal axon to one MF. As stated above, polyneuronal innervation of MFs does not likely occur in the normal mature state. Polyneuronal innervation exists in early development but disappears in rats and kittens by the age of 6 weeks. A similar phenomenon may occur transiently in reinnervation after denervation before full maturation of the reinnervation process occurs.\n [22, 7, 8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromyographic (EMG) evaluation of the motor unit (MU): electrophysiologic biopsy.

Barkhaus, MD, 2001. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe alpha MNs are arranged somatotopically into groups in the ventral horn according to myotomes and, in turn, the muscles that they supply. A group of alpha MNs supplying a muscle is organized in a vertical column within the ventral horn such that the rostral MNs supply the superficial and proximal MUs of the muscle and the more caudal MNs supply the deeper and more caudal MUs. Knight and Kamen reported that superficial MUs were larger relative to deeper MUs, as studied by using macro EMG.\n [31] In humans, almost all muscles are supplied by more than 1 root, allowing some protective effect in a single-level radiculopathy. The percent proportion of supply of a given muscle by a specific root may vary among individuals as well as between sides in the same individual.\n [32] \n\nSee Muscular System Anatomy and Autonomic Nervous System Anatomy for more information.\n\nPhysiology of the MU - Activation and control of MU discharges\nRecruitment is defined as \"the successive activation of the same and additional MUs with increasing strength of voluntary muscle contraction\".\n [16] It is a complex process that is under CNS control. MU recruitment results in a strong efficient muscle contraction. Patterns of recruitment may differ between various types of motor activation (eg, slow isometric muscle contraction vs ballistic movement). The former pattern is used in routine clinical EMG assessment of MUPs (see image below); hence, a bias exists toward examination of the lower threshold, type S MUs. In healthy muscle, a programmed pattern of activation of MUs is under central control, depending on the type of activation needed (eg, slow postural movement vs rapid phasic movement).\n [13, 14, 33, 34, 15, 35] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromyographic (EMG) evaluation of the motor unit (MU): electrophysiologic biopsy. Normal recruitment in deltoid muscle (A) recording with a concentric needle electrode: The first MUP is discharging at 13-15 Hz when a second, smaller MUP is recruited on sweep 4, discharging at 4 Hz. Potential 1 appears polyphasic, but only 4 phases are present. B shows 2 sweeps recruitment in myopathy with mild voluntary effort. The baseline appears relatively full, and individual MUPs cannot be identified without reducing level of effort and use of trigger delay. Calibration settings are as indicated.

Barkhaus, MD, 2001.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe size principle refers to alpha MN size relative to its order of recruitment in a population of MUs that comprises the fundamental organizational units of a muscle. The soma of alpha MNs vary in size, accounting for some of the differences between MU types I and II. Definite differences exist in other properties (see Table 2 above). Dendritic volume (ie, number of excitatory synapses on the neuronal soma) is constant in the 2 types of alpha MNs. Therefore, smaller type I MNs have relatively greater excitatory input given their smaller membrane size. In contrast, type II alpha MNs have a larger membrane, but given the same number of excitatory inputs, they have a lower excitatory potential.\n [7, 13, 14, 15] \n\nCritical firing level (CFL) is a specific MU property whereby a MN has a precise and reliable level or threshold of excitation at which it discharges. It ceases to discharge when input drive to the MN pool drops below the CFL. This also may be termed functional threshold. This has a narrow range of approximately 1-3% as demonstrated by varying input stimulation.\n [7, 13, 14] \n\nAlthough recruitment gradation refers to the number of alpha MNs being activated, rate gradation refers to the discharge frequency of a specific MN. In a smooth, graded isometric contraction (ie, ramp), a muscle must be capable of prolonged activation that is relatively resistant to fatigue. This is achieved by the size principle, in that the small type I MNs are activated initially. A single MU is activated first. With further effort, an increased rate gradation occurs within that particular MN before central input to a second MN (ie, recruitment gradation) reaches its CFL and begins to discharge. This continues until the larger type II MNs reach their CFLs and are activated. The type II MNs after the Type I MUs, as they are less resistant to fatigue.\n [7, 13, 14, 15] \n\nRecruitment frequency is a clinical electrodiagnosis method used to assess the firing rate of a MU. This technique can be performed only at a low level of motor unit activation when MUPs can be clearly differentiated as they are recruited.\n [3, 4, 33, 36, 34] In normal muscle, an MU shows a rate gradation of 5–15 Hz before a second MU is recruited. The firing rate of the first MU is measured immediately prior to the point at which the second MU is activated. In myopathy, the recruitment frequency is reduced. The reverse occurs in a neurogenic process: the recruitment frequency may be increased, reflecting the loss of MUs.\n\nTo correlate with routine EMG needle examination, bias exists in assessing the waveforms of type I MNs. This is because the recording is made at low levels of activation (ie, voluntary muscle effort). MUP amplitudes are relatively lower than at higher levels of activation. At maximal levels of voluntary effort, MUAP amplitudes increase, reflecting activation of the larger type II MUs and superimposition of the discharging MUs. Special studies such as precision decomposition have demonstrated that in healthy human muscle, MUs may discharge at rates approaching 50 Hz at maximal effort.\n [37] \n\nIn practical application, the MUP amplitude reflects the size and distance of the closest MF to the recording surface of the needle electrode (see first image below, section A).\n [38, 39] Thus this does not reflect MU size. As force is increased, some recruited MUs have MFs very close to the needle electrode’s recording surface. Their MUPs are recognized easily by their relatively large size given their proximity to the needle electrode. Conversely, higher threshold MUs that are distant to the electrode recording surface will have smaller amplitude MUPs (eg, the second recruited MUP in the second image below, the second recruited MUP is smaller than  than the first  recruited MUP).  Differentiating between Type I and Type II MUs on routine concentric needle EMG is not possible because of the selectivity of the electrode. Thus, the size principle is not demonstrated in CN EMG recordings.\n [40] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromyographic (EMG) evaluation of the motor unit (MU): electrophysiologic biopsy. Models to demonstrate increased recruitment frequency. A, Healthy muscle in which muscle fibers (MFs) from 6 MUs are observed close to the recording electrode. B, only 2 MUs have MFs close to the recording electrode surface; as this is a process of partial MU loss with subsequent reinnervation. C shows loss of MFs from MUs 2, 3, and 6 near the recording electrode, as may be observed in a myopathy. But MFs from only two MUs are actually close to the recording electrode surface (MUs 1 and 5) to give MUPs with sharp rise times. MUs 2, 4, and 6 are away from the recording surface and may be quite low in amplitude and appear as baseline noise, giving the erroneous impression of a reduced number of MUs.

        "Intracranial Pressure Monitoring": "\nBackground\n\n\nElevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is seen in head trauma,\n [1] hydrocephalus,\n [2] intracranial hemorrhage, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured brain aneurysm, intracranial tumors,\n [3] hepatic encephalopathy,\n [4] and cerebral edema.\n [5] Intractable elevated ICP can lead to death or devastating neurological damage either by reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)\n [6] and causing cerebral ischemia or by compressing and causing herniation of the brainstem or other vital structures. Prompt recognition is crucial in order to intervene appropriately.\nIntractable high ICP is the most common \"terminal event\" leading to death in neurosurgical patients.\n [7] The association between the severity of intracranial hypertension and poor outcome after severe head injury is well recognized.\n [6] Outcomes tend to be good in patients with normal ICP, whereas those with elevated ICP are much more likely to have an unfavorable outcome.\n [8] Elevated ICP carries a mortality rate of around 20%.\n [9] \n\n\nThe rapid recognition of elevated ICP is therefore of obvious and paramount importance so that it can be monitored and so that therapies directed at lowering ICP can be initiated. A raised ICP is measurable both clinically and quantitatively. Continuous ICP monitoring is important both for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic measures and for evaluating the evolution of brain injury.\n [10] \nAlthough some investigators have questioned invasive ICP monitoring in improving patient outcomes,\n [11, 12] numerous retrospective series and data bank studies have favored the technique.\n [13, 14, 15, 16] \n\n\n\n\nThe goal of ICP monitoring is to ensure maintenance of optimal CPP. The ICP also forms a basis for medical or surgical intervention in cases of increased ICP with agents such as 3% sodium chloride (NaCl), mannitol, or diuretics (Lasix), ventriculostomy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion, and pentobarbital coma or surgical decompression in cases of intractable ICP elevation that do not respond to conservative management.\n\n\n\n\nICP monitoring may be discontinued when the ICP remains in the normal range within 48-72 hours of withdrawal of ICP therapy or if the patient’s neurological condition improves to the point where he or she is following commands.\n\nHistory\nThe concept of ICP (normal or abnormal) being a function of the volume and compliance of each component of the intracranial compartment was proposed by the Scottish anatomist and surgeon Alexander Monro (1733-1817) and his student George Kellie (1758-1829) during the late 18th century.\n [17, 18] The interrelationship came to be known as the Monro-Kellie hypothesis. This doctrine states that the cranial compartment is encased in a nonexpandable case of bone, and, thus, the volume inside the cranium is fixed.\n\nThe doctrine further states that, in an incompressible cranium, the blood, CSF, and brain tissue exist in a state of volume equilibrium, such that any increase in volume of one of the cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another. For example, the arterial blood entering the brain requires a continuous outflow of venous blood to make room. If something does not exit the cranial compartment to make room, the ICP increases, resulting in pathology.\n\nThe confirmatory exsanguination experiments of Abercrombie, also a student of Monro, demonstrated graphically the extent to which the body placed physiological priority on maintaining the perfusion of the brain.\n [19] He drained dogs of their blood and was able to observe that the brain remained comparatively well perfused until shortly before death regardless of the dog’s position in space (hanging upside down or right side up, to control for the effects of gravity), unless the blood was drained from an intracranial vessel directly, in which case death resulted almost immediately.\n\nThe reciprocal relationship between venous and arterial blood was considered the main variable in ICP and perfusion until 1848, when George Burrows, an English physician, repeated many of the exsanguination and gravitational experiments of Abercrombie and Kellie and found a reciprocal relationship between the volume of CSF and the volume of blood in the intracranial compartment.\n [20] \n\nLeyden, working in Germany in 1866, demonstrated that elevated ICP leads to a slowed pulse and difficulty breathing, with eventual arrest of breathing entirely.\n [21] This work was built on in 1890 by Spencer and Horsley\n [22] , who found that, in the case of intracerebral tumors, death was brought about by the arrest of breathing due to increased ICP. Increased ICP was thus taken to represent a common endpoint for several insults to the brain.\n\nIn 1891, Quinke published the first studies on the technique of lumbar puncture (LP) and insisted that a glass pipette be affixed to the needle so that the CSF pressure could be measured.\n [23] This technique for repeated measurement of CSF fluid pressure as an assessment of ICP became widely used and was the earliest clinical method of ICP measurement.\n\nIn 1903, Cushing described what is now widely known as the \"Cushing Triad\" as a clinical tool for recognizing the presence of elevated ICP. The triad consists of a widening pulse pressure (rising systolic, declining diastolic), irregular respirations, and bradycardia.\n [24] In 1922, Jackson noted that the pulse, respiration, and blood pressure are affected only once the medulla is compressed, and some patients with clinical signs of brain compression had normal lumbar CSF pressures.\n [25] Cushing quantified the Monro-Kelly doctrine, writing that the sum of the volume of the brain plus the CSF volume plus the intracranial blood volume is constant. Therefore, an increase in one should reduce one or both of the others.\n [26] \n\nIn 1964, Langfitt demonstrated that LP could induce brainstem compression through transtentorial herniation or herniation of the tonsils through the foramen magnum and that, further, when the ventricular system does not communicate, spinal pressure is not an accurate reflection of ICP.\n [27] LP fell into disuse for ICP monitoring, and researchers began to directly cannulate the ventricular system.\n [28] \n\nIn 1965, Nils Lundberg revolutionized ICP monitoring with his work using bedside strain gauge manometers to record ICP continuously via ventriculostomy.\n [29] In his technique, a ventricular catheter was connected to an external strain gauge. This method has proven to be accurate and reliable and also permits therapeutic CSF drainage. Catheter-based ventricular monitoring systems were not applied systematically until the mid-1970s, when monitoring via a strain gauge became widespread after Becker and Miller reported good results in 160 patients with traumatic brain injury. They demonstrated clear evidence of good outcomes among patients in whom elevated ICP could be quickly recognized and subsequently lowered.\n [13] \n\nPhysiology\nThe most important role of the circulatory system, aside from transporting blood into all parts of the body, is to maintain optimal CPP.\n [30] The formula for calculating CPP is below.\n\nCPP = mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) - mean intracranial pressure (MIC)\n\nCPP is the pressure gradient acting across the cerebrovascular bed and, therefore, a major factor in determining cerebral blood flow (CBF).\n [31] CBF is kept constant in spite of wide variation in CPP and MAP by autoregulation.\n\nAutoregulation is a process of adjustment on the part of the brain’s arterioles that keeps cerebrovascular resistance constant over a range of CPP. Increased CPP causes stretching of the walls of the arterioles, which compensate by dilating and relieving this pressure. Likewise, in the setting of decreased pressure, the arterioles constrict to maintain CPP. This autoregulation prevents transient pressure increases from being transmitted to smaller distal vessels. When the MAP is less than 65 mm Hg or greater than 150 mm Hg, the arterioles are unable to autoregulate, and blood flow becomes entirely dependent on the blood pressure, a situation defined as \"pressure-passive flow.\" The CBF is no longer constant but is dependent on and proportional to the CPP.\n\nThus, when the MAP falls below 65 mm Hg, the cerebral arterioles are maximally dilated and the brain is at risk for ischemia because of insufficient blood flow to meet its needs. Likewise, at a MAP greater than 150 mm Hg, the cerebral arterioles are maximally constricted and any further increases in pressure cause excess CBF that may result in increased ICP.\n\nNote that, while autoregulation works well in the normal brain, it is impaired in the injured brain. As a result, pressure-passive flow occurs within and around injured areas and, perhaps, globally in the injured brain. Ideally, the goal is to maintain the CPP more than 60 mm Hg, and this can be done by either decreasing the ICP or increasing the systolic blood pressure using vasopressors. Caution should be used to use only vasopressors that do not increase ICP.\n\nThe volume of the skull contains approximately 85% brain tissue and extracellular fluid, 10% blood, and 5% CSF. If brain volume increases, for example in the setting of cancer, there is a compensatory displacement of CSF into the thecal sac of the spine followed by a reduction in intracranial blood volume by vasoconstriction and extracranial drainage. If these mechanisms are successful, ICP remains unchanged. Once these mechanisms are exhausted, further changes in intracranial volume can lead to dramatic increases in ICP.\n\nThe time course of a change in the brain has significance for how ICP responds. A slow-growing tumor, for example, is often present with normal or minimally elevated ICP, as the brain has had time to accommodate. On the other hand, a sudden small intracranial bleed can produce a dramatic rise in ICP. Eventually, whether acute or insidious in progression, compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, and elevated ICP follows.\n\nThe relationship between ICP and intracranial volume is described by a sigmoidal pressure-volume curve. Volume expansion of up to 30 cm3 usually results in insignificant changes in ICP because it can be compensated by extrusion of CSF from the intracranial cavity into the thecal sac of the spine and, to a lesser extent, by extrusion of venous blood from the cranium. When these compensatory mechanisms have been exhausted, ICP rises rapidly with further increases in volume until it reaches the level comparable with the pressure inside of cerebral arterioles (which depends on MAP and cerebrovascular resistance but normally measures between 50 and 60 mm Hg). At this point, the rise of ICP is halted as cerebral arterioles begin to collapse and the blood flow completely ceases.\n\nThe relationship between ICP and CBF and functional effects was described thoroughly by Symon and colleagues, as follows:\n [32] \n\n\n\n\n\nCBF of 50 mL/100 g/min: Normal\n\n\n\n\nCBF of 25 mL/100 g/min: Electroencephalogram slowing\n\n\n\n\nCBF of 15 mL/100 g/min: Isoelectric electroencephalogram\n\n\n\n\nCBF of 6 to 15 mL/100 g/min: Ischemic penumbra\n\n\n\n\nCBF of less than 6 mL/100 g/min: Neuronal death\n\n\n\nNormal intracranial pressure\n\nICP is generally measured in mm Hg to allow for comparison with MAP and to enable quick calculation of CPP. It is normally 7-15 mm Hg in adults who are supine, with pressures over 20 mm Hg considered pathological and pressures over 15 mm Hg considered abnormal.\n [33] \n\nNote that ICP is positional, with elevation of the head resulting in lower values. A standing adult generally has an ICP of -10 mm Hg but never less than -15 mm Hg.\n [34] In supine children, ICP is normally lower, in the range of 15 mm Hg, with infants having ICP from 5-10 mm Hg and newborns have subatmospheric pressures regardless of position.\n [35] \n\nIn adults, the choroid plexus and other locations in the CNS produce CSF at a rate of 20 mL/hour, for a total of 500 mL/day. It is reabsorbed by the arachnoid granulations into the venous circulation. CSF volume is most commonly increased by a blockage of absorption due to ventricular obstruction, occlusion of venous sinuses, or clogging of the arachnoid granulations.\n\nCauses of increased intracranial pressure\n\nIncreased ICP may result from the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace-occupying lesions: Tumor, abscess, intracranial hemorrhage (epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, intraparenchymal hematoma)\n\n\n\n\nCSF flow obstruction (hydrocephalus): Space-occupying lesion that obstructs normal CSF flow, aqueductal stenosis, Chiari malformation\n\n\n\n\nCerebral edema: Due to head injury, ischemic stroke with vasogenic edema, hypoxic or ischemic encephalopathy, postoperative edema\n\n\n\n\nIncrease in venous pressure: Due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, heart failure, superior vena cava or jugular vein thrombosis/obstruction\n\n\n\n\nMetabolic disorders: Hypo-osmolality, hyponatremia, uremic encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy\n\n\n\n\nIncreased CSF flow production: Choroid plexus tumors (papilloma or carcinoma)\n\n\n\n\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\n\n\n\n\nPseudo tumor cerebri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring": "\nOverview\n\n\nThis article provides an overview of the various neurophysiological monitoring techniques used intraoperatively.\nIntraoperative neurophysiological monitoring has been utilized in attempts to minimize neurological morbidity from operative manipulations. The goal of such monitoring is to identify changes in brain, spinal cord,\n [1, 2] and peripheral nerve function prior to irreversible damage. Intraoperative monitoring also has been effective in localizing anatomical structures, including peripheral nerves and sensorimotor cortex, which helps guide the surgeon during dissection.\n\n\nEvoked potential monitoring includes somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), motor evoked potentials (MEP), and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Electromyography (EMG) also is used extensively during operative cases. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) provides data for analysis in SSEP, BAEP, and VEP. Scalp EEG also can be used to monitor cerebral function during carotid or other vascular surgery. In addition, EEG recorded directly from the pial surface, or electrocorticography (ECoG), is used to help determine resection margins for epilepsy surgery, and to monitor for seizures during electrical stimulation of the brain carried out while mapping cortical function.\nElectrophysiological monitoring in the operative milieu poses several specific challenges. These include (1) presence of electromagnetic interference, and (2) use of anesthetic agents that can alter recordings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Laminoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nLaminoplasty describes the process of increasing the space available for the spinal cord by reconstruction of the laminar arch via a posterior approach. Laminotomy\n [1] is the surgical removal and subsequent reinsertion of laminae and spinous processes, whereas laminectomy represents the removal of the lamina and the spinous process. The term laminotomy is often incorrectly used to describe a partial laminectomy.\n [2] A partial or hemilaminectomy is the removal of the lamina on one side, starting from the medial aspect of the facet joint to the lateral aspect of the base of the spinous process, usually without removal of the spinous process itself. For each of these procedures, a plethora of technical modifications have been proposed.\n\n\nThis topic describes the most commonly performed techniques of laminoplasty in the cervical and thoracolumbar spine. The definitions of Yucesoy and Sonntag\n [2] were used for this chapter, as described in the table below.\n\n\nTable 1.

The marked boxes represent areas with significant overlap and inconsistency in terminology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCervical laminoplasty was developed in Japan in the 1970s to overcome challenges associated with the treatment of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and degenerative spinal canal stenosis.\n [3] Since the anterior approach for OPLL was found to have a significant risk of complications and OPLL has a higher prevalence in Japan, Japanese neurosurgeons led the way in refining posterior approaches.\n [4] All technical variations of cervical laminoplasty (reviewed by Casey and Crockarda\n [5] ) share the aim of reconstructing the spinal canal to relieve cord compression and prevent its recurrence.\n [6]  \n\nLaminoplasty on the thoracic and lumbar spine was first described by Raimondi and colleagues in 1976 as a technique in children for whom the high risk of instability dictated the need for replacement of the laminar arch after laminectomy.\n [7] It has been used commonly for access to the spinal cord for indications including syringomyelia, tumors, functional, and pain surgery.\n [8] 9 Degenerative and congenital lumbar stenosis is treated by laminectomy or the less invasive interlaminar fenestration with decompression.\n [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] \n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe cervical spine is made up of 7 vertebrae. The first 2, C1 and C2, are highly specialized and are given unique names: atlas and axis, respectively. C3–C7 constitute subaxial cervical vertebrae, having a body, pedicles, laminae, spinous processes, and facet joints.\n\nThe cervical spine is more mobile than the thoracic or lumbar regions of the spine. Unlike the other parts of the spine, the cervical spine has transverse foramina in each vertebra that bear the vertebral arteries usually in segments C1–C6\n [14] that supply blood to the brain.\n\nThe spinal cord is located inside the vertebral canal, which is formed by the foramina of 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, and 5 sacral vertebrae, which together form the spine. The spinal cord extends from the foramen magnum down to the level of the first and second lumbar vertebrae (at birth, down to second and third lumbar vertebrae).\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Cervical Spine Anatomy and Topographic and Functional Anatomy of the Spinal Cord.\n\nIndications\nLaminoplasty is the mainstay of treatment for cervical stenosis due to OPLL.{ref3 Patients with degenerative spinal stenosis due to spondylotic myelopathy show benefit at least equal to laminectomy after spinal decompression with laminoplasty.\n [15, 6]  In the thoracic and lumbar spine, laminoplasty serves mainly as a surgical method to access underlying spinal disease (eg, tumor, syringomyelia).\n [16, 17] \n\nA physiological spinal alignment is the prerequisite for a laminoplasty. Instability or malalignment should prompt the preoperative evaluation of the need for instrumentation. Especially helpful for when to use laminoplasty for cases with OPLL is the K-Line, a virtual line that connects the midpoints of the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal at C2 and C7 in a plain lateral radiogram. The K-line is positive when the peak of OPLL does not exceed the K-line and negative when the peak of OPLL exceeds the K-line. Decompression by laminoplasty should not be used if the K-line is negative,  but anterior decompression and fusion or posterior decompression with instrumented fusion are applicable.\n [4, 18] \n\nThe most common indications for laminoplasty are shown in the table below.\n\n\n\nTable 2. Overview of the most common indications for laminoplasty. The K-line is positive when the peak of OPLL does not exceed the K-line, and negative when the peak of OPLL exceeds the K-line.

While drilling, direct contact of the drill bit with any loose material (eg, muscle, cottonoids) should be avoided. Moreover, irrigation should be applied copiously to minimize heat transmission to surrounding tissue, which might increase the risk for C5 palsy.\n [22] \n\nA surgical microscope should be used to improve visualization when working in proximity of the spinal canal.\n [23] Throughout the procedure, meticulous hemostasis is achieved with bipolar cautery and hemostatic material. Epidural bleeding is usually well controlled by gelatin foam.\n\nBiomechanical considerations\nIn contrast to laminoplasty, laminectomy leads to a more complete removal of the medial posterior tension band structures such as the supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, spinous processes, and the muscle insertions on the midline. Initially, laminectomy provides an optimal posterior decompression. Depending on the initial stability and shape of the patient’s spine, however, laminectomy is associated with a risk of postoperative instability and kyphosis.\n [24, 25, 6, 18] \n\nThe risk of postlaminectomy instability is highest in the cervical spine and lowest in the lumbar spine.\n [26] Because no randomized controlled trials comparing laminectomy to laminoplasty exist, the potential for postlaminectomy instability is discussed below to provide assistance in decision-making.\n\nCervical laminoplasty\n\nIn the cervical spine, two thirds of the axial load is distributed along the posterior elements, including the facet joints. Once a laminectomy has been performed, the facets and anterior elements take over a more prominent part in weight bearing. This favors the progression of kyphosis with an increasing stress on the remaining muscles of the posterior tension band.\n [27, 28] \n\nNonetheless, the risk of kyphotic progression after laminectomy is low in a well-aligned and lordotic spine. Advanced age and cervical sagittal imbalance are independent preoperative risk factors for postoperative kyphotic deformity following cervical laminoplasty.\n [21] In men, the normal values of cervical spinal lordosis measured from C2 to C7 range between 16 and 20 degrees; in women, they are between 15 and 25 degrees.\n [29] \n\nThe presence of degenerative disease of the cervical spine increases the risk of postoperative deformity. A Japanese series of 64 adult patients found that 36% showed a change in spinal curvature after multilevel laminectomy and 14% developed a kyphotic or meandering deformity.\n [30] Moreover, the removal of more than 25% of the medial facet joints during cervical laminectomy increases the risk of instability and progressive deformity.\n [31, 32] After laminoplasty, the change in sagittal Cobb angle is less than two degrees over a median follow-up of almost three years.\n [33] Moreover, postoperative improvement rates in neurological status appears to be comparable after laminoplasty or laminectomy with fusion.\n [34, 35, 36, 21] \n\nThoracic laminoplasty\n\nCompared with the cervical spine where the posterior elements are exposed to most of the loading stress, the load axis of the thoracic and lumbar spine shifts anteriorly. As a consequence, procedures performed on the posterior elements in the lumbar spine may have a less immediate and dramatic effect on the spinal curvature.\n\nThe incidence of postlaminectomy deformity in the thoracic spine is low, as long as more than 50% of the facet joints are left intact. Aizawa et al found progression to kyphosis of 2.5 degrees per level in women and 0.6 degrees in men after a minimum of two years' followup after thoracic multilevel laminectomy.\n\nKyphosis is more likely to occur after laminectomy in the lower thoracic spine, which is explained by the lack of direct contact of the five lower ribs with the sternum.\n [37] \n\nLumbar laminoplasty\n\nAfter lumbar laminectomy, rates between 0% and 6% of postoperative instability were reported. The rate of instability increases to 15% when laminectomies are performed on 3 or more levels.\n [38] Some authors advocate fusion for more than 3-degree motion on flexion-extension x-ray or for laminectomies spanning 3 or more levels.\n [39] \n\nChildren\n\nThe risk of instability is highest in the immature spine of a child, where postlaminectomy deformity uniformly affects over one third of patients.\n [40] The predisposition of children to develop spinal instability after laminotomies is multifactorial and is in part ascribed to higher content of cartilage, a more horizontal alignment of facet joints, more flexible ligaments, growth of the spine, and the disease process itself. This risk of kyphosis can be decreased significantly when laminoplasty is performed instead of laminectomy.\n [41, 42] One study found no difference in complications after tethered cord release using laminotomy or laminoplasty.\n [13] However, the need for fusion may be unavoidable if postoperative deformity occurs.\n [43] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Lumbar Discectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nLumbar discectomy is the most common operation performed in the United States for lumbar-related symptoms.\n [1] Lumbar disc herniation accounts for only 5% of all low back pain problems but is the most common cause of radiating nerve root pain (sciatica).\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\nPatient with a large right L4/5 disc herniation \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nMixter and Barr described the first surgical procedure to remove the herniated lumbar disc in 1934 through a laminectomy and durotomy, with later enhancement by Semmes, who described approaching the herniated disc through hemilaminectomy and retraction of the dural sac. This became popularized as the “classical discectomy technique.”\n [3] \nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, more techniques were developed to remove the herniated disc with minimal invasiveness\n [4] . The first herniated disc excision using a microscope (microdiscectomy) was performed by Yasargil in 1977, which was the standard surgical procedure at the time. In 1993, Mayer and Brock and then in 1997, Smith and Foley described endoscopic discectomy techniques.\n [3] With these minimally invasive techniques, authors demonstrated decreased soft tissue manipulation, operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay, allowing early recovery.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nThe natural history of lumbar disc herniation indicates that they may decrease in size or even disappear within a few weeks or months of onset. In migrated or extruded herniations, phagocytosis of the herniated disc by the macrophages occurs, while, in contained herniations, dehydration of the herniated nucleus pulposus plays a major role in the reduction of the herniated disc size.\n\n\n\n\nThe literature suggests that lumbar discectomy provides effective clinical benefit in carefully selected patients with sciatica. There is strong evidence in favor of microdiscectomy surgery over conservative treatment at short-term follow-up, but, at long-term follow-up, there is no significant difference among patients with subacute lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy (LDHR) between the two groups.\n [6] Overall, the long-term benefits of surgery versus nonoperative treatment are still unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Lumbar Facetectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe synovial joints between the superior and inferior articular processes on adjacent vertebral bodies are termed the facet joints. The facet joint (also known as zygapophysial joint or Z-joint) is an important load-bearing structure in the spine.\n [1]  A gradually increasing shear load in the lower spine explains why the surface areas of the lumbar facet joints increase from L-1 to S-1. Also, the facet joint angle in the coronal plane increases, from a mean of 25º at L1–2 to about 53º at L5–S1.\n [2, 3, 4] \nThis joint plays a role in preventing extension, rotation, and anterior displacement\n [5]  while permitting gliding movements between the verterbrae. Lumbar facet joints remain in constant motion, providing the spine with the stability and flexibility supporting everyday activities. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Lumbar Spine Anatomy. \n\n\nImages depicting facetectomy can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nA) Minimally invasive approach to laminotomy and medial facetectomy with exposure of the facet joint.

B) Removal of the entire facet joint and part of the lamina with exposure of underlying exiting nerve roots, thecal sac, and disc space. C) After completion of the microdiscectomy, a transforaminal interbody fusion is performed by placing a cage device within the disc space that has been filled with bone graft material. D) Pedicle screw fixation is then performed to supplement the fusion and provide stability after a complete facetectomy has been performed. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA remodeling process in the facets has been seen to occur in cases of damage to the joint's bone structure and ligamentous capsule. Although this process can stabilize the joint, it may also lead to nerve root impingement and radiculopathy.\n [2] Degeneration of the facet’s articular cartilaginous surface may cause hypertrophy of the articular surface, which can in turn lead to stenosis. It may also result in changes in the alignment and loss of mobility. As such, in addition to disc disorders, facet joint instability, degeneration, and injuries have been associated with low back pain, radiculopathy, and other spinal disorders.\n [1]  Additionally, osteoarthritis of the facet joint can result in synovial cyst formation and subsequent back pain unrelated to a disc degeneration.\n\nA lumbar facetectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the prssure of the spinal nerve roots near the facet joint when conservative medical treatment fails to control pain and other symptoms of facet disease.\n\nIndications\nLumbar facetectomy may be performed in a partial (typically medial) or a complete way. It may also be performed unilaterally or bilaterally, depending upon the pathology and mechanism(s) of injury.\n [6] \n\nPathologies requiring a facetectomy procedure include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDegenerative spine disease, which is by far the most common indication\n\n\n\n\nTraumatic injury to the spine such as a fracture and/or subluxation requiring open reduction and fixation\n\n\n\n\nCongenital conditions such as kyphoscoliosis or other states of malalignment\n\n\n\n\nNeoplasms of the spine, in particular ones involving nerve roots such as schwannoma or neurofibroma\n\n\n\n\nVascular lesions of the spine extending along a nerve root sleeve such as a spinal arteriovenous malformation\n\n\n\n\nInflammatory conditions or infections of the spine leading to spinal destruction, misalignment, and requiring surgical reduction and fixation\n\n\n\nMedial facetectomy\nMedial facetectomy (the most commonly performed form of facetectomy) is usually performed in conjunction with a lumbar laminotomy or laminectomy and foraminotomy and is carried on with or without discectomy. In the setting of degenerative spine disease, this operation is indicated in cases refractory to medical and conservative treatment, such as anti-inflammatory treatment, physical therapy, pain management, and so on.\n [7] Indications for this procedure include the following:\n [8, 9] \n\n\n\n\n\nFacet hypertrophy resulting in foraminal stenosis on imaging studies (MRI or CT myelogram), and painful radiculopathy\n\n\n\n\nFacet hypertrophy resulting in symptomatic central stenosis, in the setting of advanced degenerative changes\n\n\n\n\nForaminal stenosis caused by other osteophytic changes, degenerative disc disease, or herniated nucleus pulposus\n\n\n\n\nNeurogenic Claudication\n\n\n\n\nPresence of a symptomatic synovial cyst\n\n\n\nIt is important to inform the patient that the main goal of this procedure is to relieve compression at the level of the foramen to treat a leg pain and radiculopathy. This procedure is not designed or indicated to treat primary axial back pain.\n [8] \n\nComplete facetectomy\nThis procedure is usually performed in the setting of a lumbar fusion, such as transforaminal or posterior lumbar interbody fusion and pedicle screw fixation. Alternatively, it may be performed unilaterally in the setting of a far lateral disc herniation (foraminal disc herniation). Removing one facet joint in its entirety does carry a more elevated risk of instability when combined with a decompressive procedure such as laminectomy (especially in extension, where alterations in rotational motion, flexibilities, and coupled motion are seen) and, while it may be performed as a standalone procedure,\n [10] it is usually best when combined with instrumentation and fusion.\n [1, 11] \n\nWhen unilateral facetectomy is carried out alone, without disruption of other posterior elements (ie, preservation of the spinous processes, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, laminas, as well as the contralateral facet joint), the risk of instability is much lower (less than 3%).\n [12] \n\nAlternatives to medial facetectomy have been suggested, such as partial medial and lateral facetectomies with preservation of at least 50% of the facet joint, in cases of foraminal pathologies. This has been demonstrated to carry a lower risk of instability,\n [13, 14] however, this view has been recently questioned.\n [10, 15] \n\nContraindications\nContraindications for medial facetectomy (performed in conjunction with a lumbar laminotomy or laminectomy and foraminotomy) include the following:\n [9] \n\n\n\n\n\nAn absence of neural compromise on imaging studies\n\n\n\n\nInstability or deformity on imaging studies precluding further decompression without consideration for fusion\n\n\n\n\nSkin or soft tissue infection at the site of the projected incision\n\n\n\n\nMedical comorbidities or advanced age precluding the patient from undergoing surgical intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Lumbar Puncture": "\nBackground\n\n\nLumbar puncture is a procedure that is often performed in the emergency department to obtain information about the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n [1, 2, 3, 4] Although usually used for diagnostic purposes to rule out potential life-threatening conditions (eg, bacterial meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage), it is also sometimes used for therapeutic purposes (eg, treatment of pseudotumor cerebri). CSF fluid analysis can also aid in the diagnosis of various other conditions (eg, demyelinating diseases and carcinomatous meningitis).\nLumbar puncture should be performed only after a neurologic examination but should never delay potentially life-saving interventions, such as the administration of antibiotics and steroids to patients with suspected bacterial meningitis.\n [5] \n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe lumbar spine consists of 5 moveable vertebrae numbered L1-L5.The lumbar vertebrae have a vertical height that is less than their horizontal diameter. They are composed of the following 3 functional parts:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vertebral body, designed to bear weight\n\n\n\n\nThe vertebral (neural) arch, designed to protect the neural elements\n\n\n\n\nThe bony processes (spinous and transverse), which function to increase the efficiency of muscle action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lumbar vertebral bodies are distinguished from the thoracic bodies by the absence of rib facets. The lumbar vertebral bodies (vertebrae) are the heaviest components, connected together by the intervertebral discs. The size of the vertebral body increases from L1 to L5, indicative of the increasing loads that each lower lumbar vertebra absorbs. Of note, the L5 vertebra has the heaviest body, smallest spinous process, and thickest transverse process.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Lumbar Spine Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Occipital Nerve Stimulation": "\nBackground\n\n\nOccipital nerve stimulation (ONS) is a form of neuromodulation therapy aimed at treating headache and craniofacial pain. This therapy involves an implantable device composed of an electrode and pulse generator. The lead is placed into the subcutaneous tissues innervated by the greater and lesser occipital nerves, and the pulse generator is implanted into a subcutaneous pocket in the chest, abdomen, or back.\nPrior to implantation, a trial is performed in which leads are placed under the skin and are connected to an external battery. The trial is performed under sedation, and the patient is discharged the same day. Afterward, the patient tries the therapy for 4–7 days and keeps a detailed pain diary.\n\n\nA permanent device is implanted only if the patient reports significant improvements in pain and quality of life. The permanent implantation is placed under sedation or anesthesia, and the patient is discharged the same day.\nThe device is programmed by a clinical specialist appointed by the manufacturer.\n\n\n\n\nThis type of therapy has been evolving as a treatment for intractable occipital headache syndromes since the first implant in 1993, and the data to support its use are robust. Multiple authors have reported that successful neuromodulation for occipital headache syndromes can be accomplished with subcutaneous regional electrode placement. Available literature on the use of peripheral neurostimulation for headache includes occipital nerve stimulation, supraorbital nerve stimulation, and infraorbital nerve stimulation. Recently, other neurostimulatory techniques such as cervical epidural neurostimulation have been explored for cluster headaches, as well.\n [1]  \n\n\n\n\nNeurostimulation is FDA-approved for the treatment of certain intractable pain syndromes, although it is not approved for headache, chronic migraine, and craniofacial pain and thus occipital nerve stimulation continues to represent an off-label use.\n\nMechanism of action\nThe theory of neuromodulation refers to therapeutic alteration of activity, electrically or chemically, in the central, peripheral, or autonomic nervous systems via the process of inhibition, stimulation, modification, or other forms of regulation. Occipital nerve stimulation is a form of neuromodulation that is reversible and adjustable and that can be tailored to an individual’s specific needs.\n\nThe mechanisms of action\n [2] for the paresthesia patterns and pain relief obtained from an occipital nerve stimulation are incompletely understood but appear to involve the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSubcutaneous electrical conduction\n\n\n\n\nDermatomal stimulation\n\n\n\n\nMyotomal stimulation\n\n\n\n\nSympathetic stimulation\n\n\n\n\nLocal blood flow alteration\n\n\n\n\nPeripheral nerve stimulation\n\n\n\n\nPeripheral and central neurochemical mechanisms\n\n\n\n\nTrigeminovascular system and Trigeminocervical tract\n\n\n\nOne prevalent theory is the involvement of the trigeminocervical system, which is the anatomic overlap of the trigeminal and occipital afferent systems at the level of C2 in the spinal cord. Trigeminal afferent pathways, and thus primary headache disorders, can be modulated at the C2 level by occipitally mediated afferents. In addition, electromodulation works to reduce blood flow to the pain-stimulating areas and to reduce abnormal excitation of the peripheral pain fibers, thus preventing central sensitization of trigeminal sensory nerve pathways, potentially reducing on-cell activity, and modulating the descending system at the level of the dorsal horn.\n\nThe gate control theory described by Melzack and Wall in 1965 (see image below) has been postulated to be one mechanism of action by which occipital nerve stimulation works for the treatment of local neuropathic pain.\n [3] According to this theory, stimulation activates large myelinated afferents, which “close the pain gate” in the substantia gelatinosa by enhancing the inhibitory actions of local circuit neurons in the dorsal horn on central transmission cells. Since pain states are maintained by continuous firing of unmyelinated and small myelinated afferents, a proportionately greater increase in the activation of large myelinated afferents closes the gate and stops pain transmission via presynaptic inhibition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA schematic diagram of the gate control theory of pain. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Percutaneous Vertebroplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nVertebroplasty is an image-guided therapy in which a cement, a fast-setting polymer, is injected into a pathologic vertebral body. The purpose of this procedure is to relieve pain and disability. It can be used in the setting of painful osteoporotic compression fractures, pathologic fractures from underlying neoplasms, or structurally compromised vertebrae. It has been used for osteoporotic or malignant fractures. The procedure was first described by Galibert et al\n [1] who found that the “internal casting” provided by polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injected into a symptomatic vertebral hemangioma provided substantial pain relief.\nWith clinical experience and landmark innovation, other indications have emerged. Vertebroplasty can increase patient mobility, decrease narcotic needs, prevent further vertebral collapse resulting in altered forces on intervertebral discs, and avoid the complications associated with prolonged immobility.\n\n\nPercutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) usually involves percutaneous injection of PMMA into the vertebral bodies. Occasionally, PMMA has also been placed manually into vertebral lesions during open surgical operations.\nKyphoplasty is often mentioned alongside vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty differs from vertebroplasty by adding an important additional step: insertion and inflation of a balloon before cement delivery, which also serves to restore vertebral body height and spine alignment.\n [2] Kyphoplasty is often used interchangeably with vertebroplasty and is considered a subset of vertebroplasty. Spine jack is a new system that corrects vertebral height, reduces the incidence of endplate damage by inserting an implant that mechanically augments the height of the vertebral body to better restore alignment followed by injection of cement.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant anatomy\nA normal thoracic spine is immobile and consists of 12 vertebrae. There are important anatomic landmarks to consider including a body, pedicles, laminae, spinous processes, and facet joints. Importantly, thoracic vertebrae have prominent lateral processes that form the articulation with the paired 12 ribs on either side. The 12 vertebrae, 24 ribs, and sternum together form the chest cavity, allowing negative-pressure respiration and providing protection of the chest wall. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of thoracic vertebrae showing vertebral body, pedicles, facets, transverse process, rib joints, spinous process, and lamina. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe lumbar spine is the next segment of the spine and is more mobile than the thoracic. The lumbar spine typically consists of 5 large vertebrae and important landmarks, including the body, pedicles, lamina, spinous processes, facet joints, and lateral processes. The lumbar spine is mobile with all articulations, contributing to flexion-extension, bending, and rotation allowing for truncal mobility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLumbar vertebrae are characterized by massive bodies and robust spinous and transverse processes. Their articular facets are oriented somewhat parasagittally, which is thought to contribute the large range of anteroposterior bending possible between lumbar vertebrae. Lumbar vertebrae also contain small mammillary and accessory processes on their bodies. These bony protuberances are sites of attachment of deep lumbosacral muscles. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThis anatomy is important to consider in three-dimensional space and be easily identifiable on X-rays in order to facilitate optimal placement of the needle under fluoroscopic guidance.

        "Percutaneous Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nIn 1984, vertebroplasty was first successfully performed in France for the treatment of a cervical vertebral hemangioma (see image below).\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\nIn a vertebral hemangioma, the fine trabeculae are replaced by venous channels, which predispose the patient to painful microfractures. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nSince then, the application of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty has expanded to include the treatment of the intense pain caused by vertebral compression fractures (see image below) that is refractory to conventional therapies such as analgesic use, bed rest, and bracing. Vertebroplasty may also be applied prophylactically to an at-risk vertebra between 2 other abnormal vertebra.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnterior wedge compression fracture with intact posterior vertebral cortex. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertebroplasty and kyphoplasty involve the injection of an acrylic cement under local anesthesia and either fluoroscopic guidance or, less commonly, CT guidance to control the pain of vertebral fractures associated with osteoporosis, tumors, and trauma (see image below). Typically, vertebroplasty is performed in an outpatient setting, while kyphoplasty typically requires hospital admission. Pain reduction or elimination is immediate, and the risk of complications is low. Neither vertebroplasty nor kyphoplasty is intended for the treatment of intervertebral disc disease or arthritis.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnterior wedge compression fracture after fusion of the fracture fragments with methylmethacrylate. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nVertebroplasty is a treatment for pain. Theoretically, 2 mechanisms may account for the pain reduction associated with the injection of methylmethacrylate. The first mechanism may be as a result of acrylic fusion of the fragments into a single block, preventing the painful motion of the individual fracture fragments against each other. The second mechanism of pain reduction may be related to the heat produced by the polymerization process as the acrylic hardens. An added benefit is that deposition of acrylic within the vertebra significantly strengthens osteoporotic bone, reducing the likelihood of repeat fracture.\n\nVertebroplasty does not restore the height of the compressed vertebral body. A related procedure, kyphoplasty, is intended to restore lost height by inflating a balloon tamp within and between the fracture fragments prior to the infusion of methylmethacrylate. The procedures result in similar relief of pain due to vertebral compression fractures.\n\nFractures and osteoporosis\nThe fractures may be as a result of bone weakened by osteoporosis, trauma, or tumors such as metastases, multiple myeloma, and hemangioma. Osteoporosis, however, accounts for most fractures. The disease accounts for an estimated annual incidence of 700,000 fractures per year; of these, approximately 260,000 are vertebral compression fractures. Once a vertebral compression fracture occurs, the risk of additional fractures in adjacent vertebrae increases 5-fold.\n\nFractures are identified in 26% of women aged 50 years or older and are radiographically present at a rate of 500 cases per 100,000 persons in patients aged 50-54 years and 2,960 cases per 100,000 persons in patients older than 85 years.\n [3] Vertebral compression fractures are twice as common in females,\n [4] occurring in 153 females per 100,000 compared with 81 males per 100,000. Prevalence rates in North America for White women ≥ 50 years are 20–24%, with a White/Black ratio of 1.6.\n [5] For reasons not clearly understood, only one third of spinal compression fractures are painful; most of these are refractory to medical management. The remaining patients report a history of significant spinal pain in the past or do not have pain at the time of diagnosis.\n\nDozens of diseases and conditions predispose individuals to osteoporosis and secondary vertebral compression fracture.

        "Peripheral Nerve Stimulator - Train of Four Monitoring": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA peripheral nerve stimulator, also known as a train-of-four monitor, is used to assess neuromuscular transmission when neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are given to block musculoskeletal activity. By assessing the depth of neuromuscular blockade, peripheral nerve stimulation can ensure proper medication dosing and thus decrease the incidence of side effects. Peripheral nerve stimulation is most commonly used for ongoing monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n\nNMBAs are used to decrease the work of breathing and facilitate mechanical ventilation in the most critically ill patients. Peripheral nerve stimulation monitoring during NMBA administration results in use of less medication, which can allow for quicker recovery of spontaneous ventilation and accelerated neuromuscular transmission recovery when the NMBA is discontinued.\nThe use of NMBAs has been decreasing because of their side effects of prolonged paralysis and muscle weakness (ie, ICU neuropathy). However, in severe cases when sedation and analgesia have been maximized, NMBAs may still be used in conjunction with other agents for several indications, such as to reduce increased intracranial pressure and to decrease oxygen consumption. In these situations, peripheral nerve stimulation may be warranted.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\nA consensus statment recommends that neuromuscular function must be monitored by observing the evoked muscular response to peripheral nerve stimulation. Ideally, this should be done at the hand muscles (not the facial muscles) with a quantitative (objective) monitor. Objective monitoring (documentation of train-of-four ratio ≥0.90) is the only method of assuring that satisfactory recovery of neuromuscular function has taken place. The statement also recommends that subjective evaluation of the responses to train-of-four stimulation (when using a peripheral nerve stimulator) or clinical tests of recovery from NMB (such as the 5-second head lift) should be abandoned in favor of objective monitoring.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nIndications\nPeripheral nerve stimulation may be indicated for the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial endotracheal intubation\n\n\n\n\nFacilitating mechanical ventilation in patients with severe lung injury\n\n\n\n\nReducing intracranial pressure\n\n\n\n\nShivering, including therapeutic hypothermia\n\n\n\n\nStatus epilepticus\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of muscle spasms related to drug overdose or tetanus\n\n\n\n\nPreservation of delicate reconstructive surgery\n\n\n\n\nFacilitation of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures\n\n\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to peripheral nerve stimulation include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nInability to obtain a secure airway\n\n\n\n\nPatient not on analgesia and sedation\n\n\n\n\nUnstable bone fractures\n\n\n\nRelative contraindications include burns, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, and peripheral neuropathy. Receptors may be resistant to NMBAs and lead to excessive doses.\n\nNeuromuscular blocking agents\nPeripheral nerve stimulation is used to assess neuromuscular transmission when NMBAs are given to block musculoskeletal activity. Nondepolarizing NMBAs such as pancuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium are most frequently used. They act by competitively blocking the binding of acetylcholine to its receptors. They have slow onset of action and long duration. Cisatricurium (Nimbex) tends to be the agent of choice because there is a lower incidence of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity.\n\nThe depolarizing blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, act instead by depolarizing the plasmatic membrane of the muscle. They have rapid onset of action and short duration. They may cause hypertension, hyperkalemia, arrhythmias, an increase in intracranial pressure, and (less often) malignant hyperthermia. For this reason, they are only used for short procedures. Because neuromuscular blocking agents are only paralytics (ie, they lack amnesic, sedative, and analgesic properties), simultaneous administration of analgesia or anxiolytics is mandatory.\n\nComplications of NMBA use include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nRoutine frequent oral care and suctioning (oral care and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention protocol)\n\n\n\n\nDeep venous thrombosis prophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nPeptic ulcer disease/gastrointestinal prophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nEye lubrication to prevent corneal abrasion\n\n\n\n\nFoot drop (prevent with high-top sneakers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Sciatic neuropathy in the gluteal region is most often caused by trauma. The nerve can be directly injured during an intramuscular injection into the buttocks.\n\n\nBecause of the close anatomical relationship between the nerve and the hip joint, nerve injuries can result from posterior dislocation of the hip, pelvic fracture, and accidental injury during elective hip arthroplasty. Other causes of sciatic neuropathy in this region include prolonged external nerve compression (“toilet seat neuropathy”), compression from pelvic hematoma, tumors, and endometriosis.

Piriformis syndrome is often misdiagnosed as disc disease and therefore may be diagnosed late.\n [3] \n\nSciatic neuropathy in the thigh is less common.

        "Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy for Spasticity": "\nBackground\n\n\nSelective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is used primarily to treat children with lower-extremity spasticity, also known as spastic diplegia or diparesis. The primary goal of SDR is to reduce spasticity and to improve lower-extremity function. Patients who ultimately benefit most from the procedure typically have pure spasticity involving the lower limbs, good cognitive function and strength, no fixed contractures, and postural stability.\nAlthough the procedure has been successful in adolescents and even young adults, it is generally performed in a younger population (aged 3-8 years).\n [1] Patients with spastic quadriparesis (all 4 extremities involved) also benefit from SDR, but improvements in the upper extremities are typically less predictable and dramatic than those seen in the lower extremities. If a child with spastic quadriparesis has a significant component of dystonia, however, SDR may not be the best treatment option, and other modalities, including intrathecal baclofen, should be considered.\n [2] \n\n\nCerebral palsy is one of the most common congenital neurological conditions in children, affecting more than 10,000 newborns each year in the United States. Its incidence in 8-year-old children is approximately 3.6 per 1000.\n [3] Intractable spasticity can cause pain, sleep disorders, increased energy requirements, interference with positioning and difficulty transferring the child, and complications with dressing and body hygiene. Individuals with spasticity often develop contractures and pressure sores that compound treatment.\n [4] More than 90% of children survive into adulthood if motor and feeding skills are ensured, which rests on the abilities of the individual, as well as caregivers.\nAmbulatory function and strength\nIn some cases, a child may use his or her spasticity for postural support in upright positions. If the child has poor underlying muscle strength, spastic tone often becomes the means by which the child is able to provide postural stability. Assessment of postural tone is important in the preoperative evaluation, as removal of this spastic tone may result in decreased ambulatory potential.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong patients with exceptionally poor strength and tone dependence, SDR may not lead to an optimal outcome.\n\nHistory of the procedure\nDorsal rhizotomy, which literally means to cut or sever a dorsal nerve root, was initially presented as a surgical treatment by Dr. Otfrid Foerster in 1911 at a meeting for the Royal Society of Medicine.\n [6] \n\nA subsequent review by Foerster, including 159 cases of spasticity, also recognized the importance of root conservation in order to preserve the balance between spasticity and flaccidity. By careful electrical stimulation of specific roots, he proposed selective root cutting in order to preserve a certain degree of function.\n [7] \n\nTheir work advanced the concept of a more selective dorsal rhizotomy, with rootlets chosen initially based on clinically identified spastic muscle groups segregated by their disabling or beneficial effects. Further modification of Foerster’s technique by Fasano et al, described as “functional posterior rhizotomy,” promoted the use of intraoperative electrostimulation for root selection instead of the Gros method of clinical identification. This allowed proprioceptive afferents to be saved and better functional outcomes to be achieved, further solidifying the procedure now known as SDR.\n [8] \n\nThe exact anatomical localization of the Ia sensory input to the spinal cord at the dorsal root entry zone by Sindou in 1974 made SDR a more functional possibility.\n [9] Severance of these specific inputs would allow for loss of tone without concomitant loss of other sensory input or motor control.\n\nSince popularization and further revision by Peacock and Eastman in 1981, the procedure has remained an important treatment for spasticity control, specifically in those with cerebral palsy.\n [10] \n\nPathophysiology\nNormal muscle tone depends on balanced excitatory and inhibitory influences on alpha motor neurons, which are nerves that begin in the spinal cord and travel via peripheral nerves to innervate skeletal muscles. Alpha motor neurons are the principle effectors of motor tone and control. Inhibitory interneurons influence alpha motor neurons within the spinal cord and are activated by cortical upper motor neurons. Excitatory influences come from both muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, which are located in the skeletal muscle/tendon, and send information to the spinal cord via afferent sensory fibers of peripheral nerves.\n\nBrain injury in cerebral palsy prevents descending spinal cord tracts from providing the necessary inhibitory influence, creating an imbalance of overabundant excitatory input. The stretch reflex arc between the spinal cord and skeletal muscle continues to receive excitatory input from Ia afferents traveling from the muscle through the peripheral sensory nerve’s dorsal root, without adequate opposing inhibition from the brain’s descending tracts, ultimately causing what is termed spasticity. Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflexes, which translates to a clinical increase in resistance to passive movement. By decreasing the excitatory afferent input from the dorsal roots, the amount of excitation experienced by the alpha motor neurons can be reduced, therefore reducing spasticity.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic drawings representing the excitatory and inhibitory influences on the spinal cord alpha motor neuron, which innervates the muscle fibers. (A) Normal physiology with a balance of inhibitory influence from descending neurons and excitatory influence from the sensory spinal reflex arc. (B) In children with spasticity, injury to the upper motor neuron results in a decrease in the descending inhibitory influence, leaving a hyperactive spinal cord reflex arc. By cutting some of the dorsal rootlets, selective dorsal rhizotomy can help restore balance to the alpha motor neuron by reducing the amount of excitatory influence on the alpha motor neuron.

It was initially described in the early 1960s but gained popularity after the publication of Stålberg and Trontelj's monograph, Single Fibre Electromyography, in 1979.\nThe selectivity of the technique results from the small recording surface (25 µm in diameter), which is exposed at a port on the side of the electrode, which is 3 mm from the tip (see image below). The selectivity of the recording is further heightened by using a high-pass filter of 500 Hz.

        "Spinal Cord Stimulation": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe knowledge that electricity could be used to treat pain dates as far back as observations by Scribonius that the pain of gout could be relieved by contact with torpedo fish.\n [1] Furthermore, multiple examples and proposed mechanisms exist that demonstrate the perception of pain is not strictly proportional to the intensity of the noxious neural stimulus.\n [2] One postulate that pioneered our view of the spinal cord’s role in the bias of nociception is attributed to the gate theory as hypothesized by Melzack and Wall in 1965.\n [3] \nThe image below depicts cross-section anatomy of spinal cord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-section anatomy of spinal cord. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nAlthough the action of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is ascribed to the direct inhibition of pain transmission in the dorsal horn, these theories do not fully explain the mechanisms by which SCS reduces pain. Before the complexity of the gate theory was realized, Dr. Norman Shealy, a Harvard-trained neurosurgeon at Case Western Reserve University, sought to show clinical support for this function by implanting the first unipolar SCS in 1967.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nRecent research has provided some insight into how such neuromodulation affects pain. The mechanisms of action may differ depending on the type of pain targeted for treatment. For example, its effect on neuropathic pain may be secondary to stimulation-induced suppression of central excitability, whereas the beneficial effect of SCS on ischemic pain may be related to stimulation-induced inhibition of sympathetic nervous system influences and antidromic vasodilation, which increases blood flow and reduces oxygen demand.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nThe neurophysiologic mechanisms of SCS are not completely understood; however, some research suggests that its effects occur at local and supraspinal levels and also through dorsal horn interneuron and neurochemical mechanisms.\n [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Experimental evidence supports a beneficial SCS effect at the dorsal horn level, whereby the hyperexcitability of wide-dynamic-range neurons is suppressed. Evidence exists for increased levels of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) release and serotonin, and perhaps, for reduced levels of some excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate and aspartame.\n [6, 7, 8] \n\nDespite our limited knowledge of the precise biological mechanisms responsible for the benefit of SCS, the estimated number of stimulators implanted each year has surpassed 20,000, and the annual revenue is in the excess of a half-billion dollars.\n [11, 12] \n\nHowever, after analysis of the medical literature, Boswell et al concluded that evidence for the efficacy of SCS in the treatment of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) was strong for short-term pain relief and moderate for long-term relief.\n [13] Also, a 20-year literature review found evidence that revealed long-term safety and efficacy of SCS in FBSS, CRPS, peripheral neuropathy, and severe ischemic limb pain secondary to peripheral vascular disease.\n [14] The primary purposes of SCS are to improve quality-of-life (QOL) and physical function by reducing the severity of pain and its associated characteristics\n [15, 16, 17] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Stereotactic Radiosurgery": "\nOverview\n\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) refers to the precise and focused delivery of a single, high dose of radiation in a single session and has been used to treat various intracranial and skull base lesions. The dosimetric characteristics of SRS, namely a highly conformal isodose distribution and a very steep dose gradient of dose fall-off beyond the prescribed isodose line, lend themselves well to the delivery of an ablative dose of radiation to intracranial and skull base lesions.\nIn radiobiology, tissues are divided into 2 broad categories, namely, early- and late-responding tissues. Early-responding tissues, such as skin, mucosa, and gastrointestinal epithelium, tend to respond acutely to radiation exposure, whereas radiation-induced effects are not immediately observed in late-responding tissues, such as vascular tissue, nerves, brain parenchyma, and spinal cord. Most malignant tumors behave like early-responding tissue, whereas benign tumors behave like late-responding tissue.\n [1] Late-responding tissues are more susceptible to a single, high dose of radiation compared with early-responding tissues, and this factor has to be considered in the delivery of SRS.\n\n\n\n\nTable.

In this article, Gamma Knife–based SRS is emphasized.The Gamma Knife device was invented by Leksell, a Swedish neurosurgeon, in Sweden in 1951. It was the first device used to deliver SRS. The first Gamma Knife device was installed in the Karolinska Institute, Sweden in 1967. The device has been modified and upgraded throughout the past few decades. Previous versions contained 201 cobalt-60 sources. The current version is PerfexionTM (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden), which contains 192 cobalt-60 sources.

        "Surgical Neurotology": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe lateral skull base is an anatomical area shared by both the neurotology and neurosurgery teams. Both teams have at their disposal numerous approaches for traversing the lateral skull base and accessing the intracranial vault.\n [1] Although many lesions in this area are considered benign (60–75%) or neurogenic (20%) in origin, they can result in local destruction and functional deficits. Extensive familiarity with the challenging anatomy in this region is crucial to successful surgery since extensive surgical approaches are often needed to access and remove disease. The discussion of approaches is divided, somewhat arbitrarily, into 3 general categories: transtemporal, suboccipital, and subtemporal.\nThe transtemporal approaches encompass techniques in which the temporal bone is the primary target through which dissection and intracranial access are achieved. The suboccipital approaches include those procedures where variations in suboccipital craniotomies provide access to the posterior fossa. The subtemporal approaches constitute procedures where access to varying regions of the middle or posterior fossae are achieved caudal to the temporal lobe.\n\n\nFinally, combined middle fossa- posterior fossa approaches are discussed. As will be readily demonstrated, many approaches combine elements of subtemporal, suboccipital, and transtemporal vectors and can be considered in multiple ways.\nA surgical team’s approach will depend on both disease location and etiology. Completely removing disease or obtaining adequate oncologic margins must be weighed against morbidity of the resection. Etiology is equally important; while surgical excision is the only curative option, the national trend towards treatment of paragangliomas in this area is observation, and non-surgical therapy such as radiation. This is partly due to the relatively slow growth of parangliomas – an average of 0.8mm/year.\n\n\n\n\nContinuing advances in the field of skull base surgery aim to decrease patient morbidity while improving access to disease location. While further developments and studies are needed to draw conclusions, some surgeons have found success using endoscopic techniques for approaching the lateral skull base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Therapeutic Hypnosis": "\nOverview\n\n\nPsychiatrists and psychologists use hypnosis to treat a variety of conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder, phobias (simple, social, performance anxiety), panic disorder, pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and certain dermatological disorders. Therapeutic hypnosis may also be used to aid in smoking cessation or weight loss.\n [1, 2] \nIndications\nCognitive behavior therapy with exposure to the feared situation is typically the therapy of choice for phobias.\n [3] However, hypnosis has been used in the treatment of various phobias including simple phobia, social phobias, and performance anxiety. Hypnosis can reduce symptoms of anxiety by inducing a more tranquil state that is associated with the induction technique. Additionally, hypnosis has been shown to augment patient’s resilience when dealing with stressful situations and decreasing avoidance behavior.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \n\n\nVarious meta-analyses have pointed to hypnosis as an adjunct therapy for smoking cessation, with reinforcement by regular contact with medical professionals and counselors as an integral part of the treatment.\n [10] Although hypnosis is not a definitive treatment, it has been successfully used as an adjunct treatment.\n [11] However, in some studies hypnosis was not found to be more effective than cessation trials without hypnosis.\n [12] \n\n\n\n\nSome meta-analyses have indicated that hypnosis may enhance weight loss. Patient undergoing cognitive-behavioral therapy for weight loss were compared to patients undergoing similar therapy with the addition of hypnosis, with favorable results reported for 70% of the patients receiving hypnotic therapy. Mean weight loss was 6.03 lbs for patients not receiving hypnosis and 14.88 lbs for patients receiving hypnosis. Further correlational analyses indicated that the benefits of hypnosis for weight loss increase over time.\n [13, 14, 15, 16] \nAccording to one meta-analysis, hypnotic suggestions relieved pain in 75% of 933 subjects participating in 27 different experiments. The pain relief from hypnosis often matched or even exceeded the relief given by morphine.\n [17] Another study showed that participants who were highly suggestible received the greatest benefit from reduction in pain when compared to placebo. A participant’s responsiveness to suggestion was the primary determining factor in the extent of pain reduction.\n [18] \n\n\n\n\nOne of the most studied uses of hypnosis in medicine is the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment methods typically consist of medication and dietary changes, but the addition of hypnosis has been shown to decrease and even eliminate symptoms. Palsson et al. showed that hypnosis benefitted patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome for at least 10 months. Initially, imagery directed at reducing pain was used, but the authors found that hypnosis alone gave patients the most benefit.\n [19]  Hypnosis has further been demonstrated to be effective for irritable bowel syndrome for patients when conventional treatment approaches have proven ineffective or insufficient. There is evidence that even patients that are less susceptible to hypnosis than others may benefit from hyphnotherapy interventions. Benefits of hypnotherapy in irritable bowel syndrome include symptom attenuation and even remission. In some instances, symptom improvement has continued even after a hypnotherapy intervention has concluded.\n [20] \n\nSome studies have shown that hypnosis can be used as an adjunct treatment for various skin conditions, including alopecia areata and psoriasis. These studies had a limited number of participants but showed that hypnosis therapy could help alleviate stress in patients suffering from dermatological conditions. The patients were broken into two groups, with one group receiving active suggestions and another receiving hypnosis. Patients who were shown to be highly hypnotizable displayed greater improvement than moderately hypnotizable patients, regardless of which modality of treatment was used.\n [5, 21, 22] \n\nHypnosis has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials to be effective in treating sleep impairment in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Improvements in sleep performace have then been noted to result in corresponding reduction of depression and PTSD symptoms after subsequent interventions such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT). However, hypnosis has not been demonstrated to assist PTSD symptoms as a standalone intervention.\n [23] \n\nAnother consistently documented application of hypnotherapy is its potential role in palliative care. Hypnotherapy has been demonstrated to assist in symptom control, stress reduction for patients and caregivers, and overall quality of life improvement. Numerous studies have suggested that hypnotherapy should not be delayed for appropriate qualified palliative care patients when such an intervention is available.\n [24] \n\nContraindications\nWhen evaluating a patient for potential hypnosis, it is important to consider possible contraindications, including the emotional state of the patient and the desired outcome. Cooperation is an essential element for effective hypnosis. If an individual is uncooperative or hostile, hypnosis may not be the best treatment option. Additionally, some patients will not be able to be hypnotized due to brain trauma or cognitive deficits. In these cases, hypnosis is contraindicated.\n\nThe use of hypnosis is generally not advisable for patients with borderline personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, or psychosis. For patients with borderline personality disorder or dependent personality disorder, there is a risk that the patient will want to form intense or inappropriate relationships or interactions with the practitioner. Perhaps the most important concern is that hypnosis could exacerbate a pre-existing psychosis. Therefore, hypnosis is contraindicated for a patient displaying signs of psychosis.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nAn abreaction is a negative response that can occur at any time during hypnosis. It is sometimes caused by unpleasant or uncomfortable memories that are brought into awareness during hypnosis. Some practitioners of hypnosis use abreactions as part of the therapy; others seek to limit these experiences. An abreaction is often an uncomfortable situation that may be followed by crying or angry outbursts. Addressing the concerns of the participant by acknowledging the abreaction is often the safest way to deal with the situation.\n\nMany myths are associated with hypnosis, including that people lose control while in a hypnotic state and that they can become “stuck” in a trance. Hypnosis is a voluntary act and patients are always in control of their actions. For example, if a practitioner suggests something that is not agreeable to a patient, the patient will not do it. In addition, hypnosis is not a permanent condition; it usually ends as soon as the practitioner starts the termination process. However, a patient can end the hypnotic state at any time he or she chooses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Trigeminal Neuralgia Surgery": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nOnce developed, trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is likely to have an exacerbating and remitting course. Over time, the pain-free intervals appear to diminish, and the pain becomes progressively more medically intractable. Temporary spontaneous remission may occur at any time, but permanent remission never occurs.\n\n\nWithout treatment, typical TN (TN1) may transform over time to become atypical TN (TN2), with a change in the character of the pain to more constant and background pain and the development of sensory impairment. Therefore, some authorities recommend early intervention to give the opportunity of pain relief without sensory deficits.\nOver time, the drugs used for the treatment of TN often lose effectiveness as patients experience breakthrough pain. In some studies, more than 50% of patients with TN eventually had some kind of surgical procedure. Experience would indicate that medical management eventually fails in most patients with TN, and those patients undergo surgery. For patients in whom medical therapy has failed, surgery is a viable and effective option.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Dalessio, 25-50% of patients eventually stop responding to drug therapy and require some form of alternative treatment.\n [1] The clinician then may consider referral to a surgeon for 1 of the procedures discussed below. Among patients who develop TN when younger than 60 years, surgery is the definitive treatment.\n\n\n\n\nNeurosurgery is generally more helpful in those patients with paroxysmal rather than constant pain and in patients whose pain follows the anatomic distribution of 1 or more trigeminal distributions rather than being spread diffusely. The various operations often fail after 1 or several years of initial relief. Such failure necessitates a repeat procedure, often with improved but still incomplete results. Thus, many patients eventually restart pain medication after surgery. Surgery appears to be less effective for TN secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nThe timing for surgery is debatable, and no randomized study has addressed this question. However, it seems that the earlier a surgical technique is applied, the better the outcome is likely to be. At least 2 medication trials should be performed and carefully evaluated before more invasive techniques are instituted.\n [2] \n\nThe following clinical guidelines have been published:\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational RadioSurgery Association -Stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with intractable typical trigeminal neuralgia who have failed medical management\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies -Practice parameter: The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review)\n [4] \n\n\n\nFor more information, see Trigeminal Neuralgia and Management of Acute Trigeminal Neuralgia.\n\nIndications\nSurgical treatment is indicated for patients whose TN is intractable despite medical therapy, in those who are intolerant to the adverse effects of the medications, and in those in whom previous procedures failed.\n\nMVD is usually indicated for patients younger than 70 years who are at lower risk for complications during general anesthesia, although healthy older patients can tolerate it well. Percutaneous approaches (eg, radiofrequency ablation, glycerol injection, balloon compression, radiosurgery) are more frequently offered to elderly patients, those in poor medical condition, those with MS, and those in whom previous MVD has failed.\n\nIn elderly patients with limited life expectancy, radiofrequency rhizotomy (ie, PRTG) is sometimes preferred because it is easy to perform, has few complications, and provides symptomatic relief for a period.\n\nSurgical Options\nMany operations have been offered to patients in recent decades. Local ablation of the peripheral nerve and wide sectioning of the sensory roots have largely been abandoned. In the past, alcohol injection was given to the affected nerve; rhizotomy or tractotomy was recommended if pharmacologic treatment was unsuccessful.\n\nAlcohol or phenol injection of the trigeminus can be performed at various locations along the nerve, and the goal is to destroy selective pain fibers. Although it is an easy procedure, the success rate is low, in part because of a low selectivity of effect on the fiber type with this substance. Recurrence rates are around 50% at 1 year.\n\nThree operative strategies now prevail: percutaneous procedures, gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS), and microvascular decompression (MVD). Ninety percent of patients are pain-free immediately or soon after any of the operations, though relief lasts far longer with MVD. Pain-free intervals last on average 1.5–2 years after two of the percutaneous procedures (percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizotomy [PRGR] and percutaneous balloon microcompression [PBM]), 3–4 years after GKRS, 4–5 years after another percutaneous procedure (radiofrequency trigeminal gangliolysis),  and 10–12 years after MVD.\n [5] \n\nPercutaneous procedures make sense for older patients with medically unresponsive TN. Younger patients and those expected to do well under general anesthesia should first consider microvascular decompression–presently the most cost-effective surgery.\n\nMore recently, however, both MRI imaging and posterior fossa exploration have frequently revealed a structural cause for neuralgia such as an ectatic artery impinging on the trigeminal nerve root. In such cases, simple decompression and separation of the compressing vessel from the nerve root produces long-lasting relief of symptoms.\n\nThe cost per quality adjusted pain-free year was $6,342, $8,174, and $8,269 for glycerol rhizotomy, microvascular decompression, and stereotactic radiosurgery, respectively, according to Pollock.\n [6] As of 2005, approximately 8000 patients with TN were undergoing surgery each year in the United States, at an estimated cost exceeding $100 million.\n\nThe primary complications of surgery include troublesome sensory loss over the face or the dysesthetic syndrome of anesthesia dolorosa. Anesthesia dolorosa can be disabling, occasionally is worse than the original TN, and is difficult to treat. For this reason, procedures with the best long-term success and the least risk of a residual facial dysesthetic syndrome are the most promising.\n\nIn 2008, Tatli et al reviewed surgical options, which mostly included MVD and radiofrequency rhizotomy.\n [2] Their review suggests that each surgical technique for treatment of TN has merits and limitations. They also found that MVD provides the highest rate of long-term patient satisfaction with the lowest rate of pain recurrence.\n\nAnatomic Considerations\nThe trigeminal nerve is the largest of all the cranial nerves. It exits laterally at the midpons level and has 2 divisions—a smaller motor root (portion minor) and a larger sensory root (portion major). The motor root supplies the temporalis, pterygoid, tensor tympani, tensor palati, and mylohyoid muscles, as well as the anterior belly of the digastrics muscle. The motor root also contains sensory nerve fibers that particularly mediate pain sensation.\n\nThe gasserian ganglion is located in the trigeminal fossa (Meckel cave) of the petrous bone in the middle cranial fossa. It contains the first-order general somatic sensory fibers that carry pain, temperature, and touch. The peripheral processes of neurons in the ganglion form the 3 divisions of the trigeminal nerve: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular (see the image below). The ophthalmic division exits the cranium via the superior orbital fissure; the maxillary and mandibular divisions exit via the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory. The mandibular nerve has sensory and motor functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of trigeminal nerve with its 3 main divisions. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe proprioceptive afferent fibers travel with the efferent and afferent roots.

        "Ventriculoatrial Shunt Placement": "\nBackground\n\n\nVentriculoatrial shunt (VAS) placement enables cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow from the cerebral ventricular system to the atrium of the heart. This procedure is indicated for hydrocephalus, which is among the most common conditions encountered in neurosurgical practice.\nThere are multiple potential anatomic configurations for CSF shunts. Most commonly, a catheter is positioned within the cerebral ventricle (the proximal site) and connected to a unidirectional valve that limits flow based on pressure or flow rate. The outflow port of the valve is connected to another length of catheter, which is passed subcutaneously to a space within which CSF can be absorbed (the distal site).\n\n\nThe preferred distal site is the peritoneal space (ventriculoperitoneal shunt [VPS]), in that this space is generally safely accessible and possesses more than adequate absorptive capacity for the CSF volume produced by a given person. In rare cases, the peritoneal space is inadequate, necessitating the use of an alternative distal site. The most common of these alternative sites are the cardiac atrium (VAS\n [1] ) and the pleural space (ventriculopleural shunt).\nThe primary consideration in any patient who may undergo VAS placement is whether the patient has symptomatic hydrocephalus that necessitates CSF diversion. If so, the surgeon must rule out the peritoneal space as an acceptable location before selecting the cardiac atrium as the site for the distal catheter. Common reasons for this include previous intra-abdominal infection and scarring due to prior procedures or intra-abdominal pathology. Once the peritoneum is ruled out, the surgeon must verify that the atrium is an acceptable target.\n\n\n\n\nThrombosis of the feeding jugular or subclavian veins may preclude successful access to the cardiac atrium. Long-term thrombosis or previous instrumentation of these vessels can lead to scarring and permanent occlusion. Doppler ultrasonography (US) can be used to effectively evaluate the patency of these large veins if this is of concern. The presence of other intravascular devices (eg, a peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC] line or indwelling central venous catheter) may complicate placement of the shunt catheter or removal of either catheter.\n\n\n\n\nOther considerations include whether the pleural space might represent an adequate alternative. In children younger than 4 years and in patients with poor pulmonary reserve, the pleura may not provide the necessary CSF-absorbing capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Tap": "\nOverview\n\n\nVentriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, which are used to treat hydrocephalus\n [1] , shunt cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lateral ventricles of the brain into the peritoneum. Tapping or aspirating the shunt is performed for both diagnostic reasons (eg, evaluate for shunt infection and blockage) and therapeutic reasons (eg, allows fluids to be drawn off to alleviate symptoms from a blocked shunt).\nThe ventricles of the brain are a communicating network of cavities filled with CSF and located within the brain parenchyma. The ventricular system is composed of 2 lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct, and the fourth ventricle. The choroid plexuses located in the ventricles produce CSF, which fills the ventricles and subarachnoid space, following a cycle of constant production and reabsorption. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ventricles of the Brain.\n\n\nThe exact role of shunt taps in diagnosing shunt malfunctions is still under debate;\n [2] therefore, the patient's neurosurgeon should be consulted before this procedure is carried out.

        "Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) consists of the use of chest compressions and artificial ventilation to maintain circulatory flow and oxygenation during cardiac arrest (see the images below). Although survival rates and neurologic outcomes are poor for patients with cardiac arrest, early appropriate resuscitation—including early defibrillation when needed—and appropriate implementation of post–cardiac arrest care lead to improved survival and neurologic outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivery of chest compressions. Note the overlapping hands placed on the center of the sternum, with the rescuer's arms extended. Although it may be difficult to tell from the illustration, the rescuer's elbows should be locked out. Chest compressions are to be delivered at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer should push as hard as needed to attain a depth of each compression of 2 inches, and should allow complete chest recoil between each compression ('2 inches down, all the way up'). The rescuer should minimize any interruptions in compressions.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivery of mouth-to-mouth ventilations. Avoid excessive ventilation. If no advanced airway, 30:2 compression-ventilation ratio. That is, perform 30 compressions and then 2 breaths.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nIndications and contraindications\nCPR should be performed immediately on any person who has become unconscious and is found to be pulseless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of cardiac electrical activity via rapid rhythm strip recording can provide a more detailed analysis of the type of cardiac arrest, as well as indicate additional treatment options.\n\nLoss of effective cardiac activity is generally due to the spontaneous initiation of a nonperfusing arrhythmia, sometimes referred to as a malignant arrhythmia. The most common nonperfusing arrhythmias include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nVentricular fibrillation (VF)\n\n\n\n\nPulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)\n\n\n\n\nPulseless electrical activity (PEA)\n\n\n\n\nAsystole\n\n\n\n\n          Pulseless bradycardia\n         \n\n\nAlthough prompt defibrillation has been shown to improve survival for VF and pulseless VT rhythms,\n [1] CPR should be started before the rhythm is identified and should be continued while the defibrillator is being applied and charged. Additionally, CPR should be resumed immediately after a defibrillatory shock until a pulsatile state is established. This is supported by studies showing that preshock pauses in CPR result in lower rates of defibrillation success and patient recovery.\n [2] \n\nIn a study involving out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Seattle, 84% of patients regained a pulse when defibrillated during VF.\n [3] Defibrillation is generally most effective the faster it is deployed.\n\nThe American College of Surgeons, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the National Association of EMS Physicians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have issued guidelines on the withholding or termination of resuscitation in pediatric out-of-hospital traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest.\n [4] Recommendations include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nWithholding resuscitation should be considered in cases of penetrating or blunt trauma victims who will obviously not survive.\n\n\n\n\nStandard resuscitation should be initiated in arrested patients who have not experienced a traumatic injury.\n\n\n\n\nVictims of lightning strikes or drowning with significant hypothermia should be resuscitated.\n\n\n\n\nChildren who showed signs of life before traumatic CPR should be taken immediately to the emergency department; CPR should be performed, the airway should be managed, and intravenous or intraosseous lines should be placed en route.\n\n\n\n\nIn cases in which the trauma was not witnessed, it may be assumed that a longer period of hypoxia might have occurred and limiting CPR to 30 minutes or less may be considered.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the circumstances or timing of the traumatic event are in doubt, resuscitation can be initiated and continued until arrival at the hospital.\n\n\n\n\nTerminating resuscitation in children should be included in state protocols.\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThe only absolute contraindication to CPR is a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order or other advanced directive indicating a person’s desire to not be resuscitated in the event of cardiac arrest. A relative contraindication to performing CPR is if a physician justifiably believes that the intervention would be medically futile. This is an area of active research.\n [5, 6] \n\nEquipment\nCPR, in its most basic form, can be performed anywhere without the need for specialized equipment. Universal precautions (ie, gloves, mask, gown) should be taken. However, CPR is delivered without such protections in the vast majority of patients who are resuscitated in the out-of-hospital setting. Some hospitals and EMS systems employ devices to provide mechanical chest compressions. A cardiac defibrillator provides an electrical shock to the heart via 2 electrodes placed on the patient’s torso and may restore the heart into a normal perfusing rhythm.\n\nTechnique\nIn its full, standard form, CPR comprises the following 3 steps, performed in order:\n\n\n\n\n\nChest compressions\n\n\n\n\nAirway\n\n\n\n\nBreathing\n\n\n\nFor lay rescuers, compression-only CPR (COCPR) is recommended.\n\nPositioning for CPR is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nCPR is most easily and effectively performed by laying the patient supine on a relatively hard surface, which allows effective compression of the sternum\n\n\n\n\nDelivery of CPR on a mattress or other soft material is generally less effective\n\n\n\n\nThe person giving compressions should be positioned high enough above the patient to achieve sufficient leverage, so that he or she can use body weight to adequately compress the chest\n\n\n\nFor an unconscious adult, CPR is initiated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nGive 30 chest compressions\n\n\n\n\nPerform the head-tilt chin-lift maneuver to open the airway and determine if the patient is breathing\n\n\n\n\nBefore beginning ventilations, look in the patient’s mouth for a foreign body blocking the airway\n\n\n\nChest compression\n\nThe provider should do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the heel of one hand on the patient’s sternum and the other hand on top of the first, fingers interlaced\n\n\n\n\nExtend the elbows and the provider leans directly over the patient (see the image below)\n\n\n\n\nPress down, compressing the chest at least 2 in\n\n\n\n\nRelease the chest and allow it to recoil completely\n\n\n\n\nThe compression depth for adults should be at least 2 inches (instead of up to 2 inches, as in the past)\n\n\n\n\nThe compression rate should be at least 100-120/min\n\n\n\n\nThe key phrase for chest compression is, “Push hard and fast”\n\n\n\n\nUntrained bystanders should perform chest compression–only CPR (COCPR)\n\n\n\n\nAfter 30 compressions, 2 breaths are given; however, an intubated patient should receive continuous compressions while ventilations are given (8-10 ventilations per minute for an intubated adult patient)\n\n\n\n\nThis process is repeated until a pulse returns or the patient is transferred to definitive care\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent provider fatigue or injury, new providers should rotate onto the chest every 2-3 minutes (ie, providers should swap out, giving the previous chest compressor a rest while another rescuer continues CPR\n\n\n\nVentilation\n\nIf the patient is not breathing, 2 ventilations are given via the provider’s mouth or a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If available, a barrier device (pocket mask or face shield) should be used.\n\nTo perform the BVM or invasive airway technique, the provider does the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure a tight seal between the mask and the patient’s face\n\n\n\n\nSqueeze the bag with one hand for approximately 1 second, forcing at least 500 mL of air into the patient’s lungs\n\n\n\nTo perform the mouth-to-mouth technique, the provider does the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPinch the patient’s nostrils closed to assist with an airtight seal\n\n\n\n\nPut the mouth completely over the patient’s mouth\n\n\n\n\nAfter 30 chest compression, give 2 breaths (the 30:2 cycle of CPR)\n\n\n\n\nGive each breath for approximately 1 second with enough force to make the patient’s chest rise\n\n\n\n\nFailure of the chest to rise with ventilation indicates an inadequate mouth seal or airway occlusion\n\n\n\n\nAfter giving the 2 breaths, resume the CPR cycle\n\n\n\nComplications\nComplications of CPR include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nFractures of ribs or the sternum from chest compression\n\n\n\n\nGastric insufflation from artificial respiration using noninvasive ventilation methods (eg, mouth-to-mouth, BVM); this can lead to regurgitation, with further airway compromise or aspiration; insertion of an invasive airway (eg, endotracheal tube) prevents this problem\n\n\n\nACLS\nIn the in-hospital setting or when a paramedic or other advanced provider is present, ACLS guidelines call for a more robust approach to treatment of cardiac arrest, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug interventions\n\n\n\n\nECG monitoring\n\n\n\n\nDefibrillation\n\n\n\n\nInvasive airway procedures\n\n\n\nEmergency cardiac treatments no longer recommended include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nRoutine atropine for pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole\n\n\n\n\nCricoid pressure (with CPR)\n\n\n\n\nAirway suctioning for all newborns (except those with obvious obstruction)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "CBRNE - Chemical Decontamination": "\nOverview\n\n\nEmergency departments (EDs) and emergency medical services (EMS) are responsible for managing potential chemical disasters, whether they result from industrial accidents or terrorist activities. In recognition of this responsibility, The Joint Commission (TCJ) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) require EDs to prepare for hazardous material incidents.\n [1] \nIn treating patients with chemical exposures, decontamination is of primary importance provided the patient does not require immediate life-saving interventions.\n [2] Any plan must include contingencies for contamination sources within the hospital and for ED evacuation. The determination of a workable hazardous materials plan requires careful thought and often professional input from medical toxicologists, hazardous materials teams, and industrial hygiene and safety officers. Using a patient decontamination plan implemented without specific adaptation to the hospital and without practice can result in undesirable outcomes.\n\n\nLegal requirements apply to hospital-based decontamination. All \"first responders\" for hazardous materials incidents must meet OSHA requirements (29 CFR 1910.120[q]) for both staff training and response to hazardous materials, because they likely will be presented with a chemically exposed patient who has not been decontaminated. Under these regulations, emergency personnel who may decontaminate victims exposed to a hazardous substance should be trained at a minimum to the first-responder operational level. For response to an unknown hazard, OSHA regulations require Level B protection, which includes a positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and splash-protective chemical-resistant clothing. For hospital-based first receivers, however, certain criteria allow for the use of Level C personal protective equipment (PPE) in personnel performing initial triage and decontamination at the hospital.\n [3]  \nFor more information, see Medscape’s Disaster Preparedness and Aftermath Resource Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "CBRNE - Chemical Warfare Mass Casualty Management": "\nSpecific Procedures for a Chemical Weapon Response\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis article is for managers who prepare hospital operational plans, for leaders responsible for response activities within a hospital, and for hospital healthcare providers. It is intended to provide credible source material on how to accomplish numerous concurrent tasks required during a chemical event involving a large number of casualties. More specifically, the intent is to offer possible solutions to a number of tasks comprising the intimidating mission of caring for overwhelming numbers of chemically contaminated casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical warfare mass casualty management. Courtesy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nAlthough no one article can contain everything a medical treatment facility will require to complete this mission, a number of practical solutions to critical tasks are presented. This information is the product of expertise acquired during the 1991 Persian Gulf War assisting hospitals to prepare, train, and exercise to receive chemical warfare agent casualties; during many years of preparing a hospital response capability for a disaster; and during actual hospital disaster response. It is a work in progress and will be regularly updated.\n\n\n\n\nThese recommended actions will be most useful in planning the early response phase of a chemical event but also have relevance for other public health events. It is not meant to supplant other works from either private or governmental sources but rather to provide a complementary perspective on how to approach several key tasks. A number of additional resources are identified to facilitate preparation of plans and procedures; these are identified as references or as web sites in the text.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the measures discussed are possible actions for an individual healthcare facility, the inherent nature of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) demands a community or regional approach (The Joint Commission). Each healthcare organization within the community must define its role and understand the roles and limitations of other treatment facilities to develop viable comprehensive plans to address overwhelming numbers of casualties. Through collaborative planning, community healthcare institutions capabilities and limitations will be recognized.\n\nThe joint community planning extends beyond healthcare facilities. An event that produces large numbers of casualties will transcend all aspects of emergency response and local government. Police, fire, emergency medical services (EMS), and other emergency operations groups must plan together to identify overlapping capabilities and, more importantly, to recognize limitations and develop interagency communications capability. Many areas have local emergency planning committees (LEPC). These committees would provide an excellent forum to begin or continue planning to protect public health, safety, and the environment from chemical hazards.\n\nA hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) is a necessary first approach. Defining potential hazards within the local geographic area is essential to prepare comprehensive, all-inclusive, realistic plans. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) included examples of HVAs in their publication \"Best Practices for Hospital-Based First Receivers.\"\n [1] Developing an HVA in concert with other medical and nonmedical authorities will provide a basis for decision-making and development of coordinated plans. Identification of appropriate staff, development of specialized teams, selection of personal protective clothing, other specific equipment and materials, and necessary pharmaceuticals can only be determined once specific local hazards are recognized.\n\nEnvironmental conditions will present risks to both casualties and hospital first receivers. Practical solutions are required for cold weather to protect patients during decontamination. Hospital personnel working outside in hot conditions, particularly those in personal protective equipment (PPE), are at risk for heat injury. Environmental factors are particularly important when large numbers of personnel are being triaged and held for treatment. Persons who are chronically ill, elderly, and very young are especially susceptible to heat or cold; an area must be identified to protect them from extreme conditions.\n\nProcedures for a chemical weapon response\nSpecific measures to handle an incident involving a chemical WMD should be integrated into existing hospital emergency preparedness plans. Although some of these measures are common to disaster response of any nature, the demands that may result from a chemical WMD crisis may require expanding existing hospital emergency preparedness plans, personnel, equipment, and training, including the protection of employees and the physical plant.\n\nFirst, a recognized chain of command to direct the hospital staff and to manage critical assets during a mass casualty event will be required to provide an orderly response. The designated leader is responsible for coordinating the activities of the departments and hospital staff in accordance with the emergency preparedness plan. In addition, the leader is responsible for communicating and coordinating activities with outside agencies. This chain of command may be delineated in the healthcare facility incident command system (see Hospital Incident Command System [HICS]) or in the emergency operations plan.\n\nOne strategy to promote such planning is to have department or clinic chiefs prepare a sequence of objectives for their staff to achieve during response to a chemical incident that is in accordance with the overarching hospital response plan. Include peripheral activities that are interdependent to the response such as housekeeping, facility engineers, maintenance, administrative, pharmacy, and security staffs. To support the hospital plan, each department or unit must develop a standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines how each task is to be accomplished. The unit's SOP must be simple but all-inclusive; each task must be defined. Cue cards or checklists to address specific tasks or the sequence of tasks can be prepared as appendices to the SOP. The cue cards, distributed at the outset of an event, list essential tasks to be performed and prevent them from being overlooked. Laminated wallet cards can be issued pre-event. The SOPs must be consolidated and reviewed closely to identify shortcomings and to ensure a coordinated response.\n\nStaff members must practice frequently to maintain their competency. Also, take into consideration the staffing differences by shift or day of the week. Special attention to training is needed by part-time weekend personnel.\n\nA chemically hazardous environment requires additional safeguards to protect hospital workers and patients. Designate a qualified safety officer. This officer ensures work/rest cycles of employees working in PPE are tracked and followed, ensures accountability of personnel, ensures contamination control, and identifies safety hazards that occur during the hospital response. In addition, the safety officer ensures that patients are decontaminated thoroughly before entering the hospital; therefore, the safety officer is the last line of defense for clinical personnel and the facility. Even with the urgent needs of many victims of a chemical attack, the hospital, staff, and patients must not be compromised by chemical contamination.\n\nEstablish a plan to handle decontaminated and contaminated victims of a chemical WMD incident.\n [2] Ideally, Fire and Emergency Services first responders or hazardous materials (HAZMAT) teams decontaminate people at the incident site before evacuating them to a medical facility, but this cannot be relied upon. However, planners should anticipate that less-injured patients may self-transport to the nearest medical facilities and may contaminate these facilities. The plan must include ways of diverting these people to a holding and/or treatment area that does not compromise the healthcare facility. The requirement to remove all chemical contamination from patients delays their entry into the healthcare facility but should not delay lifesaving treatment by staff in appropriate PPE. Finally, do not rely on hasty decontamination done by others outside the hospital. Put patients through a thorough decontamination procedure at the hospital when indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

In addition to attack by terrorists, preparations must also be made for a nuclear power plant disaster or contamination by radiologic medical sources. The explosions at the Fukushima Daiichi Japanese nuclear power plant after the March 2011 massive earthquake increased fear of contamination from radiation.\n [2] In the event of radiologic contamination, rapid treatment can be lifesaving.\nProperly completed, rapid decontamination can reduce morbidity and mortality, limit the spread of contamination, and keep the ED functioning for the treatment of other patients.\n [3] \n\n\nFor related information, see Medscape Reference article CBRNE - Radiation Emergencies.\nFor patient education resources, visit the First Aid and InjuriesCenter.

        "Cooling Techniques for Hyperthermia": "\nOverview\n\n\nHeat illness is a pervasive problem that is often encountered in patients who present to the emergency department. During summer heat waves, large urban centers see a significant rise in hyperthermia-related fatalities. Heat illness should be thought of as a spectrum of disease from heat cramps to heat stroke. Rehydration therapy alone is not sufficient to treat heat stroke, and cooling measures are needed.\n [1] \nMedication-related hyperthermic conditions such as malignant hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) need to be specifically recognized, as the treatment of these diseases requires adjunctive pharmacotherapy (eg, dantrolene, cyproheptadine, bromocriptine, levodopa, amantadine) in addition to rapid cooling measures. Patients may also present with hyperthermia as a consequence of agitated delirium states, which require sedation in addition to aggressive cooling. Understanding basic principles of thermoregulation and the pathophysiology of hyperthermia is essential to treatment.\n [2, 3] \n\n\nThe image below depicts items used for noninvasive cooling techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample display of equipment useful for various cooling techniques. Clockwise from top: ice pack and water, air-cooling blanket, Foley catheter, and intravenous fluids. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Burning Up? A Guide to Treating Heat Illness, a Critical Images slideshow, for tips on treatment options for patients with heat-related illness.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, see Football Injuries: Slideshow to help diagnose and treat injuries from a football game, including heatstroke, a major concern in college and high school football.\n\nEffective thermoregulation, controlled by the hypothalamus, is critical for proper function of the human body, with normal temperature exhibiting diurnal variation between 36-37.5°C. Heat is both produced endogenously and acquired from the environment. Metabolic reactions in human bodies are exothermic, contributing 50-60 kcal/h/m2 of body surface area, or 100 kcal/h for a 70-kg person. During strenuous exercise, heat production increases 10- to 20-fold.\n [4] Environmental heat transfer involves the following 4 mechanisms\n [4] :\n\n\n\n\n\nConduction: Direct physical contact transfers heat from a warmer object to a cooler object. Water is about 25 times more conductive (more effective at conducting heat) than air.\n\n\n\n\nConvection: Heat is transferred through air and water vapor molecules surrounding the body. Convective heat transfer depends on wind velocity and explains the effect of wearing loose-fitting clothing in warm climates to keep cool.\n\n\n\n\nRadiation: Heat is transferred by electromagnetic waves. Radiation is the major source of heat gain in hot ambient climates; up to 300 kcal/h can be gained on a hot summer day.\n\n\n\n\nPhase change: The conversion of a solid to a liquid (melting) or a liquid to a gas (evaporation) results in heat transfer. Evaporation of 1 L of sweat from the body results in a loss of 580 kcal of heat.\n\n\n\nHyperthermia is defined as elevated core temperature of greater than 38.5°C  (101.3°F). History and clinical examination can help elucidate the etiology of hyperthermia and tailor treatment. The causes of hyperthermia include the following\n [5] :\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased ambient heat - Heat waves, humidity\n\n\n\n\nIncreased heat production - Overexertion, thyroid storm, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, pheochromocytoma, delirium tremens, hypothalamic hemorrhage, toxic ingestions (eg, sympathomimetics, anticholinergics, MDMA)\n\n\n\n\nDecreased heat dissipation - Humid environment, poor sweat production\n\n\n\nSweating and peripheral vasodilation are major mechanisms of heat loss to maintain proper temperature. In the absence of these mechanisms, baseline temperature would increase 1.1°C per hour from basal metabolism alone.\n [5] Sweat cools the body through evaporation, and peripheral vasodilation provides the blood flow and heat necessary to evaporate the sweat. During periods of high environmental heat and humidity, evaporative cooling can become insufficient, leading to heat illness.\n\nPatients at risk for heat illness include the following\n [6, 7] :\n\n\n\n\n\nAthletes exercising strenuously in hot climates\n\n\n\n\nElderly patients (because of decreased efficacy of thermoregulation, comorbid illness or medications, lack of fans or air conditioning, inappropriate dress)\n\n\n\n\nInfants and small children (because of high ratio of surface area to weight, inability to control fluid intake)\n\n\n\n\nPatients with cardiac disease or those taking beta-blockers (because of inability to increase cardiac output sufficiently for vasodilation)\n\n\n\n\nPatients who are dehydrated because of poor fluid intake, gastroenteritis, and diuretic or alcohol use (Dehydration increases demand on ATPase pumps, which contribute 25-45% of basal metabolic rate.)\n\n\n\n\nPatients prone to higher endogenous heat production (eg, infection, thyrotoxicosis)\n\n\n\n\nPatients taking medications that inhibit sweat production or increase heat production (eg, anticholinergics, antidepressants, antihistamines, neuroleptics, zonisamide, sympathomimetics, alpha- and beta-blockers), especially in hot weather; deaths from cocaine are markedly increased when the ambient temperature increases\n [8] \n\n\n\nRecognizing the clinical signs associated with heat illness determines the appropriate therapy, from fluid replacement for heat exhaustion to rapid aggressive cooling for heatstroke.\n [5, 6, 7] \n\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal to slightly elevated core temperature\n\n\n\n\nFatigue or malaise\n\n\n\n\nOrthostatic hypotension, tachycardia\n\n\n\n\nClinical signs of dehydration\n\n\n\n\nNausea, vomiting, diarrhea (due to splanchnic and renal vasoconstriction)\n\n\n\n\nIntact mental status\n\n\n\n\nResponsive to cool environment, fluid and electrolyte replacement\n\n\n\nSymptoms of heatstroke include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nElevated core temperature, usually greater than 40.5°C\n\n\n\n\nVague prodrome of weakness, nausea, vomiting, headache\n\n\n\n\nCNS symptoms including confusion, ataxia, coma, seizures, delirium\n\n\n\n\nHot, dry skin\n\n\n\n\nHyperdynamic cardiovascular response\n [9] (high central venous pressure [CVP], low systemic vascular resistance [SVR], tachycardia)\n\n\n\n\nElevation of hepatic transaminases, usually in the tens of thousands range\n\n\n\n\nCoagulopathy\n\n\n\n\nRhabdomyolysis and renal failure\n\n\n\nThis article focuses specifically on rapid cooling techniques for hyperthermic patients, a critical action in the initial resuscitation of patients with heatstroke. In fact, rapid cooling may be the single most important action to prevent death or permanent disability. To mitigate organ damage, the goal should be to reduce rectal temperature to below 40°C within 30 minutes of beginning cooling therapy.\n [7, 10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Disaster Planning": "\nIntroduction: The Scope and Nature of the Problem\n\n\nA disaster is an unplanned event in which the needs of the affected community outweigh the available resources. A disaster occurs somewhere in the world almost daily, but these events vary considerably in scope, size, and context. Large-scale disasters with numerous casualties are relatively unusual events. Certain widely publicized disasters, including events such as the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the Boston Marathon bombing, have focused people’s attention on disaster planning and preparedness. Disasters are becoming more frequent, and the number of persons affected is also increasing. This greater morbidity is attributable not only to the greater number of events, but also to population dynamics, location, and susceptibilities.\nWhile these incidents have led to an increase in general disaster awareness, the relative infrequency of major catastrophes affecting defined populations leads to a certain degree of complacency and underestimation of the impact of such an event. In the wake of a large-scale event, public attention focuses on disaster planning and preparedness and the resources dedicated to improving response and resiliency surge. This phenomenon has been described as \"issue salience\" and has then been noted to decline over time as communities return to their quotidian lives.\n [1] The result of complacency is relative reluctance to devote the necessary resources for adequate disaster preparedness. Understanding the effects of a serious event on the community may indicate that the best time to propose major changes for disaster preparedness, including funding, is immediately following a widely publicized disaster, even if the event has occurred in a remote location.\n [2] \n\n\nIn the United States, large, multiple-casualty events have been rare. Only 10 disasters in US history have resulted in more than 1,000 casualties (see Table 1). The vast majority of events have resulted in fewer than 40 fatalities. According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the September 11 attacks caused 2,819 deaths.\n [3] This number is a fraction of the 44,065 deaths from motor vehicle accidents in the United States in 2002. The dramatic nature of disasters, however, with a relatively high death toll and psychological impact for a short period, can overwhelm an unprepared health and emergency response system and create chaos in the affected community and surrounding regions.\n\n\nTable 1.

Debate still exists about the actual number of people who died during Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. An article by Brunkard et al published in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness in August 2008, puts the Louisiana death toll at 971 plus another 15 deaths among evacuees.\n [4] An Associated Press article from 2006 claims the total number of bodies recovered from Louisiana and Mississippi was more than 1300.\n [5] There is also ongoing investigation into the possibility that the storm caused deaths during subsequent months and years due to myriad causes (eg, inadequate medical care, relocation stresses).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhen a disaster strikes, the general population expects public service agencies, emergency response agencies, and other branches of the local, state, or federal government to rapidly mobilize to help the injured and the broader community in general. Preservation of life and health are of paramount importance to those individuals injured in disasters. For this, among other reasons, medical professionals must be included in all phases of disaster planning as well as immediate response to these events. Medical professionals have a unique expertise and knowledge of local and regional healthcare systems, which can assist in disaster mitigation and planning. Persons affected by a disaster also rely on their skills and treatment in the immediate response to an event. Adequate preparation and planning, as well as provider and agency education and training, have become more relevant following the visibly problematic responses to many events, including the response to Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Emergency Bedside Thoracotomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nSince its introduction in 1900, the emergency department thoracotomy (EDT, sometimes referred to as emergency resuscitative thoracotomy) has been a subject of intense debate. It is a drastic, last-ditch effort to save the life of a patient in extremis due to injury. Although some studies boast a 60% survival rate, others have argued that EDT is a futile and expensive procedure that only places health care providers at significant personal risk. Further, indications for EDT have widely varied. For these reasons, the EDT remains a controversial but potentially lifesaving procedure in a select group of patients.\n [1, 2] \nThe causes of acute circulatory arrest after chest injury include hemorrhagic shock due to injury to the heart or intrathoracic vasculature, cardiac tamponade, and tension pneumothorax.\n\n\nThe primary goals of EDT include the following\n [3] :\n\n\n\n\n\nHemorrhage control\n\n\n\n\nRelease of cardiac tamponade\n [4, 5] \n\n\n\n\nFacilitation of internal/open cardiac massage\n [6, 7] \n\n\n\n\nPrevention of air embolism\n\n\n\n\nExposure of the descending thoracic aorta for cross-clamping\n\n\n\n\nRepair cardiac or pulmonary injury\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergent thoracotomy typically takes place in the emergency department or operating room.

        "Hazmat": "\nOverview\n\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of providing emergency medical care is attending to patients who have been contaminated with hazardous materials. HAZMAT is a term used to describe incidents involving hazardous materials or specialized teams who deal with these incidents. Hazardous materials are defined as substances that have the potential to harm a person or the environment upon contact. These can be gases, liquids, or solids and include radioactive and chemical materials. Biological organisms, such as viruses and bacteria, are not included as hazardous materials in this article. Following are images of burns due to radiation exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly erythema in the frontal and antelateral right side of the chest 5 days after the exposure to an iridium-192 source (185 GBq, 5 Ci) mounted in a pen-size sourceholder for industrial radiography, which was placed to the pocket of the worker's overall and kept there for about 2 hours.

Terrorist activities in the United States, Japan, Europe, and Asia and the fear of contamination from radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan (see image below) stemming from the March 2011 massive earthquake highlight the need for hospital preparedness. Federal statutes require hospitals to participate in the planning and care of persons exposed to hazardous materials and to train and provide protection for employees who may be exposed while providing medical care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthquake and tsunami damage to the Fukushima I nuclear power plant in Japan.

More than 60,000 chemicals are produced annually in the United States, of which the US Department of Transportation (DOT) considers approximately 2000 hazardous. More than 4 billion tons of chemicals are transported yearly by surface, air, or water routes. These shipments are initiated from more than 100,000 different locations, with more than 1 million people directly involved in the transportation process. More than 500,000 shipments of hazardous materials are made every day, totaling approximately 1.5 billion tons per year.\n [1, 2, 3] \n\nThe incidence of hazardous materials exposures cannot be ascertained accurately because a national reporting system does not exist. In an attempt to better define the magnitude of this problem, the Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry developed the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) system in 1990. Fifteen state health departments participate in the reporting system. In these states, the system has shown the following findings\n [4] :\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 9000 releases of hazardous substances occur annually, with 75% occurring at chemical facilities and 25% occurring during transportation.\n\n\n\n\nMost transportation-related incidents occurred during ground transport (85%) and 26% occurred in residential areas.\n\n\n\n\nHuman error and equipment failure account for most releases.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common substances involved were inorganic substances (24%) followed by volatile organic compounds (20%).\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2000 people are victims of hazardous materials releases in these states each year. Approximately 50% of these are transported to hospitals. Respiratory and eye irritation are the most common types of injury. Over a 4-year period, 132 hazardous material–related deaths occurred.\n\n\n\n\nMore than 7500 people required decontamination during HAZMAT events over a 4-year period in these states. Of these, 2643 were decontaminated at medical facilities.\n\n\n\nSeveral important points can be drawn from the above statistics. Most importantly, this is not a rare problem. Cities, prehospital-care providers, and hospitals need to have plans for dealing with these incidents and caring for victims of hazardous material exposures. Because most incidents occur at fixed sites, knowing the industries that operate in the catchment area of a hospital and the chemicals used or stored at those sites is imperative. Trauma centers need to have a plan to care for trauma patients who are contaminated because 25% of the incidents occurred during transportation and 9% of victims of hazardous materials exposure also had traumatic injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Labor and Delivery in the Emergency Department": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nFew events cause more stress for the full time emergency physician than a pregnant woman at full term who is ready to deliver in the ED. This article discusses the delivery of a newborn in the ED; for a more general discussion of full-term obstetric delivery, see the Medscape article Normal Delivery of the Infant.\nHistory\nSigns of imminent delivery, as follows, should be noted:\n\n\n\n\n\nBloody show, the expulsion of the mucus plug from the cervix\n\n\n\n\nBreakage of the amniotic sac (bag of waters). Determine the appearance of the fluid expelled. Clear fluid is normal, thin fluid is meconium (fetal intestinal contents consisting of the remains of swallowed amniotic fluid mostly composed of sloughed digested skin cells) stained, and thick pea-soup fluid is heavy meconium.\n\n\n\n\nThe sensation of impending defecation or an urge to push\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso see Presentation.\nComplications\nThe infant death rate for 2019 was 558.3 per 100,000 live births.\n [1]  Approximately 700 women die each year in the United States as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nSeveral items, including the umbilical cord and placenta previa, can be felt at initial vaginal examination. Note the following: \n\n\n\n\n\n          Umbilical cord compression: Have medical personnel insert a sterile gloved hand into the vagina, into the cervix, and against the pelvic wall, while maintaining space between the index and middle fingers for the cord to pass uncompressed. This individual should accompany the patient and stay in this position until the operating surgeon or obstetrician directs otherwise.\n         \n\n\n\nPlacenta previa: Copious vaginal bleeding usually heralds placenta previa. The mother may be aware of this condition prior to admittance to the ED. Do not perform a vaginal examination in a patient who is bleeding vaginally and in labor. Order an immediate ultrasonography, type and cross-match blood, and alert a surgeon and an obstetrician.\n         \n\n\nStillbirth may occasionally occur; despite everyone's best efforts, a child may be born without signs of life. Psychological support for the parents is mandatory. Grieving occurs, with all of its potential for pathologic processes. If available, a clergyperson or counselor should visit the parents. Recommend a support group to the parents.\n\nWorkup\nFew laboratory tests are useful. Initial determination of the patient's hemoglobin level and Rh blood group status is required. If the patient has received prenatal care, other laboratory tests have been performed.\n\nKleihauer-Betke testing can be ordered after delivery for Rh-negative mothers of Rh-positive infants. (One unit of Rh immunoglobulin per 15 mL fetal blood in the mother's circulation is administered intramuscularly within 72 h of delivery.)\n\nAlso see Imaging Studies.\n\nTreatment\nPrehospital care\n\nProvide oxygen.\n\nObtain intravenous access.\n\nGenerally, transport the patient in the left lateral recumbent position; use this position especially if the expectant mother's blood pressure decreases (because of pressure on the vena cava, which reduces return to the heart).\n\nPrepare for field delivery, because little can be done to prevent the birth.\n\nEmergency department care\n\nSee Emergency Department Care.\n\nAlso see Medication.\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nPatients with COVID-19 suffer maternal morbidities at a higher rate (up to 9%) than the general population.\n [3]  Additionally, emergency department personnel must be protected from COVID-19 transmission.

        "Volume Resuscitation": "\nBackground\n\n\nVolume depletion takes place when fluid is lost from the extracellular space at a rate exceeding net intake. Acute hemorrhage is the leading cause of acute life-threatening intravascular volume loss requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain tissue perfusion until the underlying cause can be corrected. Intravascular volume depletions may also result from gastrointestinal disorders (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, or ascites), burns, environmental exposure, or renal salt wasting. Volume depletion may result from acute sequestration in the body in a “third space” that is not in equilibrium with the intracellular fluid, as seen in septic shock.\nWhen volume loss occurs, the body reacts by triggering a wide range of physiologic regulatory responses to maintain perfusion in the vascular beds of the most important organs, namely the heart, brain, and kidneys. Decreases in circulating blood volume lead to a drop in arterial blood pressure, and diminished venous return reduces preload, stroke volume, and, therefore, cardiac output. This stimulates aortic baroreceptors, cardiac stretch receptors, and the sympathetic nervous system to increase ventricular contractility, venous and arterial vasoconstriction, and fluid shifts into the intravascular system.\n\n\nThe kidneys react through the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by retaining sodium and water and releasing antidiuretic hormone to increase intravascular volume. The coagulation system responds through the release of local mediators such as thromboxane and platelet-aggregating factor and controls sites of bleeding through vasoconstriction, platelet plug formation, and fibrin deposition.\nWithout adequate fluid resuscitation, tissue hypoperfusion leads to lactate production and metabolic acidosis. Once the physiologic response to hypovolemia is overwhelmed by prolonged tissue hypoxia, myocardial contractility is depressed and hypoxia and acidosis result in the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction, release of inflammatory mediators and activation of cellular apoptotic pathways, eventually leading to death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n"

        "A-Scan Biometry": "\nUltrasound Principles\n\n\nSound is defined as a vibratory disturbance within a solid or a liquid that travels in a wave pattern. When sound frequency is between 20 hertz (Hz) and 20,000 Hz, the sound is audible to the human ear. To be considered ultrasound, sound waves must have a frequency greater than 20,000 Hz (20 KHz), rendering them too high in frequency to be audible to the human ear.\n [2]  In ophthalmology, most A-scan and B-scan ultrasound probes use a frequency of approximately 10 million Hz (10 MHz) that is predesigned by the manufacturer. This extremely high frequency allows for not only restricted depth of penetration of sound into the body but also excellent resolution of small structures. This meets unique needs because, at times, the probe is placed directly on the organ to be examined when its structures are quite small, requiring excellent resolution.\n\nThe velocity of sound is determined completely by the density of the medium through which it passes. Sound travels faster through solids than through liquids—an important principle to understand because the eye is composed of both. In A-scan biometry, sound travels through the solid cornea; the liquid aqueous; the solid lens; the liquid vitreous; the solid retina, choroid, and sclera; and then orbital tissue. Therefore, it continually changes velocity.\n\nThe known sound velocity through the cornea and the lens (average lens velocity for the cataract age group, approximately 50-65 yr) is 1641 meters/second (m/s), and velocity through the aqueous and the vitreous is 1532 m/s. Average sound velocity through the phakic eye is 1550 m/s. Sound velocity through the aphakic eye is 1532 m/s, and velocity through the pseudophakic eye is 1532 m/s plus the correction factor for IOL material.\n [3] The cornea is not routinely factored in because of its thinness. If one were to consider 1641 m/s at about 0.5 mm, only 0.04 mm would have to be added to the total eye length, which in no way alters the IOL calculation.\n\nIn A-scan biometry, a thin, parallel sound beam is emitted from the probe tip at its given frequency of approximately 10 MHz, with an echo bouncing back into the probe tip as the sound beam strikes each interface. An interface is the junction between any 2 media of different densities and velocities, which, in the eye, include the anterior corneal surface, the aqueous/anterior lens surface, the posterior lens capsule/anterior vitreous, the posterior vitreous/retinal surface, and the choroid/anterior scleral surface.\n\nEchoes received back into the probe from each of these interfaces are converted by the biometer to spikes arising from baseline. The greater the difference in the 2 media at each interface, the stronger the echo and the higher the spike.\n [3] If the difference at an interface is not great, echo is weak and the displayed spike is short (eg, vitreous floaters, posterior vitreous detachments). No echoes are produced if sound travels through media of identical densities and velocities (eg, young normal vitreous, the nucleus of a noncataractous lens in which the A-scan display goes down to baseline).\n\n(See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-quality contact A-scan of the phakic eye. Note the 5 high-amplitude spikes and the steeply rising retinal spike, as well as the good resolution of separate retinal and scleral spikes. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn the case of a cataractous lens, multiple spikes occur within the central lens area as the sound beam strikes differing densities within the lens nucleus. This spike height, or amplitude, is what provides the information on which the quality of measurements is based. In fact, the \"A\" in A-scan is derived from the word \"amplitude.\"\n\nSpike height is affected not only by the difference in density as it travels through the eye but also by the angle of incidence, which is determined by probe orientation to the visual axis. If the probe is held so that the emitted sound beam strikes the corneal vertex, the anterior lens, the posterior lens, and the retina in a perpendicular manner, it is in the proper position to receive echoes back into the probe tip so they can be converted to spikes. Sound waves can be reflected and refracted in the same way as light rays; if the probe is held in a nonparallel manner, part of the echo is diverted at an angle away from the probe tip and therefore is not received by the machine.\n [3] The greater the angle of incidence, the weaker the signal and the shorter the spike amplitude.\n\n(See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the sound beam incidence is parallel and coaxial to the visual axis (upper image), most returning echoes are received back into the probe tip to be interpreted on the display as high-amplitude spikes. When the sound beam incidence is oblique to the visual axis (lower image), part of the returning echo is reflected away from the probe tip, with only a portion received by the probe. As a result, the spikes will be compromised. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe shape and the smoothness of each interface affect spike quality. An irregularity in the surface of an interface causes reflection and refraction of returning sound waves away from the probe tip and therefore weaker echoes.\n [3] This is why it is important to know whether macular pathology that could adversely affect spike quality has been identified. A perfect, high, steeply rising retinal spike may be impossible to attain when macular pathology (eg, macular edema, macular degeneration, epiretinal membranes, posterior staphylomas) is present.\n\n(See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the macular surface is smooth (upper image), more of the echoes are received back into the probe to be displayed as high-amplitude spikes. If the macular surface is convex (center image), as with macular edema or pigment epithelial detachments, some echoes are reflected away from the probe tip. If the macular surface is irregular (lower image), as in macular degeneration or epiretinal membranes, reflection of echoes away from the probe tip will occur. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn addition, sound is absorbed by everything through which it passes before it travels on to the next interface. The greater the density of the structure it is passing through, the greater the amount of absorption. This principle explains why retinal spike quality is reduced in the case of an extremely dense cataract; the lens absorbs much of the sound, and less sound actually reaches the retinal surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Abdominal Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nAs compared to comprehensive imaging performed in the radiology department, emergency ultrasonography is a bedside diagnostic modality that answers time-sensitive specific questions about a patient’s condition. Emergency ultrasonography is diagnostic, can be used to assess clinical response in ongoing resuscitations, and can help guide invasive procedures. It directly influences patient management decisions and interventions in multiple ways. In terms of diagnosis, emergency ultrasonography can answer time-sensitive life-saving questions such as the following: Does this 70-year-old man with low back pain have an abdominal aortic aneurysm?

For improved patient comfort, consider using warmed ultrasound-conducting gel, if available.\n\nUltrasound imaging does not use ionizing radiation and has not been shown to be associated with genetic damage or oncogenesis.\n\nTissue damage secondary to heat production when Doppler imaging is used is a theoretical risk, so high-energy modes typically are avoided with fetal ultrasonography.\n\nAs both ultrasound technology and the training to use such technology improve, new clinical applications and indications for use in the emergency department (ED) will continue to grow. New and investigational applications of abdominal ultrasound include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of abdominal wall pathology, including hernias, abscesses, and solid masses, and wound evaluation\n [4, 5] \n\n\n\n\nUse of sonographic contrast agents to improve assessment of solid organ injuries in trauma patients\n\n\n\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been suggested as offering an alternative to CT in stable children with blunt abdominal trauma. In a systematic review by Pegoraro et al, it was reported that the range of sensitivity and specificity for CEUS was 85.7-100% and 89-100%, respectively.\n [6] \n\nCT has long been the gold standard for diagnosing suspected small-bowel obstruction (SBO). Some studies are comparing point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) with CT imaging in the diagnosis of SBO. A POCUS-first approach to SBO could lead to a reduced need for advanced imaging, decreased ED length of stay, and reduced patient exposure to radiation. However, clinical decision tools are needed to allow clinicians to better identify which patients would benefit most from CT imaging for SBO in the ED.\n [7] \n\nUltrasonography has been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing ureter stones by identifying hydronephrosis. In a study by Kim et al, ED length of stay associated with real colic was significantly lower in patients who underwent ultrasonography than in those who underwent conventional  workup (151-194 min vs. mean 234 min).\n [8] \n\nUltrasonography is recommended as first-line imaging for appendicitis in children. A study by Kasmire et al showed that pediatric patients who received point-of-care ultrasonography had a significantly shorter mean length of stay (274 min) in the pediatric ED than those who did not (317 min).\n [9]  In a meta-analysis of 17 studies of POCUS for acute appendicitis, pooled sensitivity was 84% and specificity 91%; pediatric sensitivity was 95% and specificity 95%.\n [10] \n\nIn a study by Tyler et al of ultrasonography to diagnose the presence of appendicitis in adults in the ED, of 174 patients, 25 of 25 patients with a positive US had appendicitis, 32 of 146 with indeterminate US had appendicitis, and 0 of 3 with a negative US had appendicitis.\n [11]  \n\nGuidelines\nGuidelines on gastrointestinal ultrasound by the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology include the following\n [12] :\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a complete examination of the bowel, both a low-resolution probe and a high-resolution probe are needed.\n\n\n\n\nA probe with a frequency greater than 5  MHz should be used when wall thickness is measured.\n\n\n\n\nColor Doppler imaging should be used to evaluate the vascularization of pathologic bowel wall.\n\n\n\n\nCEUS of the bowel can be used to separate vascular from avascular intestinal or peri-intestinal lesions, including abscesses.\n\n\n\n\nUltrasound elastography can be used to evaluate the stiffness of pathologic thickened bowel.\n\n\n\n\nStandard examination of the intestine does not require specific preparation.\n\n\n\n\nFasting longer than  6 hours is recommended before splanchnic blood flow is measured.\n\n\n\n\nOvernight fasting is recommended before gastrointestinal motility is assessed.\n\n\n\n\nBowel wall thickness < 2  mm (not the cutoff value for pathology) could be considered normal when measurement is performed in the normal filling state, except in the duodenal bulb and the rectum.\n\n\n\n\nBowel wall thickness should be measured perpendicular to the wall from the interface between the serosa and the proper muscle and the interface between the mucosa and the lumen.\n\n\n\n\nA resistive index in the superior mesenteric artery between 0.80 and 0.89 should be considered normal.\n\n\n\n\nPeak systolic velocity of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) between 80 and 220  cm/sec should be considered normal.\n\n\n\n\nTransabdominal ultrasound can be used to assess normal bowel anatomy, vascularization, and luminal width.\n\n\n\n\nThe anatomic location of the bowel, peristalsis, and luminal content can be assessed by gastrointestinal ultrasound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The introduction of CT technology is widely viewed by medical practitioners as one of the major medical advances.\n [1] Abdominal CT scanning is used in the evaluation of trauma victims for visceral injury\n [2] and in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain, with a major role in evaluation of renal calculi,\n [3]  acute appendicitis,\n [4] and complex abdominal pathology (see the images below).\n [5] It is also the gold standard in identifying abdominal injury in children.\n [6, 7]  Appropriate precautions must be taken before the scan to ensure that the patient has adequate renal function and no history of allergy before intravenous iodinated contrast is prescribed.\n [8, 9]  The technologist will have a direct discussion with the patient to review the risks and refer any identified issues to the radiologist. Informed consent and counseling are required for patients categorized as high risk according to clinic or institutional policy. Technologists usually are certified to obtain verbal consent for uncomplicated cases, but for written consent, a physician must review risks and benefits directly with the patient.\n(See the images below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT of the abdomen and pelvis using oral and IV contrast; a reformatted coronal image is shown.

Multidetector CT (MDCT) has a major role in characterization and staging of tumors of the liver, pancreas, kidneys, bowel, reproductive organs, and lymphatic system. It also has a role in screening for hepatocellular carcinoma\n [10] and colon carcinoma using virtual colonoscopy.\n [11, 12, 13]  In addition, it is used in surgical treatment planning and in diagnosis of postoperative complications.\n [14, 15] \n\nScan protocols are adapted for the specific diagnostic problem, and images are reformatted for viewing on picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstations. Additional manipulation can be done on PACS or on dedicated workstations, providing for multiplanar and 3-dimensional views of organs, vessels, and bones. With the use of appropriate luminal and intravenous contrast agents, information can be obtained on lesion characteristics based on tissue attenuation changes, detailed 3-dimensional arterial anatomy, and/or luminal surface contour (eg, in virtual colonoscopy).\n\nThe patient is optimally positioned on the CT scanner table. As the patient is advanced into the scanner, he or she is coached by technologists, who have direct visualization and bidirectional auditory communication with the patient as the study is performed. Typically, the patient is warned to anticipate the effects of contrast injection and is informed about breath-holding requirements during the scan. Technologists select the correct protocol for the prescribed examination and select exposure parameters, taking into consideration factors such as the patient’s body habitus to optimize image quality while limiting radiation exposure.\n\nLau et al concluded that early-routine-use CT for early abdominal pain confers both diagnostic and survival benefits by providing more correct diagnoses at 24 hours and lower mortality at 6 months.\n [16] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriprocedure\n\n\n        \n      \n",
        "Abscess Evaluation With Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nAbscesses and other superficial soft tissue infections are common presentations in the emergency department (ED).\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  The number of ambulatory and ED visits for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) have doubled over the past 2 decades, with over 14 million estimated annually in the United States. This rise in SSTIs is largely attributable to the increase in incidence of cellulitis and abscess, as well as the rising prevalence of community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n [7]  Patients who present with localized signs of swelling, pain, and erythema, and in whom cellulitis and abscess might be present, are excellent candidates for bedside ultrasonography.\n [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] \nIn a subset of patients, the physical examination reveals a grossly fluctuant subcutaneous collection that is indicative of an abscess. In many cases, however, the clinical presentation is not that clear. Physical examination alone is often inadequate when differentiating between simple cellulitis and deeper SSTIs.\n [1] These disease entities are managed differently, and misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary painful procedures or an increase in morbidity, time lost, or cost to the patient.\n [2, 13] \n\n\nStudies have shown that bedside ultrasonography significantly improves clinicians’ ability to differentiate between cellulitis and abscess and, thus, to initiate the most appropriate treatment from the outset.\n [3, 14] The advantages of bedside ultrasonography include low cost, portability, patient comfort, speed of detection (usually < 1 min), and wide availability. Additionally, if a fluid collection is detected, ultrasonography can better localize the fluid for subsequent aspiration or incision and drainage.\n [12] \nIn a systematic review performed to determine the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) in ED patients with SSTIs, sensitivity was 96.2% (95% CI 91.1% to 98.4%); specificity, 82.9% (95% CI 60.4% to 93.9%); positive likelihood ratio, 5.63 (95% CI 2.2 to 14.6); and negative likelihood ratio, 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.11).

        "B-Scan Ocular Ultrasound": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nB-scan ultrasonography is an important adjuvant for the clinical assessment of various ocular and orbital diseases. With understanding of the indications for ultrasonography and proper examination technique, one can gather a vast amount of information that cannot be obtained through clinical examination alone.\n [1]  \nB-scan ultrasound is most useful when direct visualization of intraocular structures is difficult or impossible. Situations that prevent normal examination include lid problems (eg, severe edema, partial or total tarsorrhaphy), keratoprosthesis, corneal opacities (eg, scars, severe edema), hyphema, hypopyon, miosis, pupillary membranes, dense cataracts, and vitreous opacities (eg, hemorrhage, inflammatory debris).\n [2] \n\n\nIn such cases, diagnostic B-scan ultrasound can accurately image intraocular structures and provide valuable information on the status of the lens, vitreous, retina, choroid, and sclera. However, in many instances, ultrasound is used for diagnostic purposes even though pathology is clinically visible. Such instances include differentiating iris and ciliary body lesions; differentiating vitreous opacities and membrane formations; differentiating and measuring intraocular tumors; identifying serous versus hemorrhagic choroidal detachments; identifying rhegmatogenous versus tractional or exudative retinal detachments; ruling out scleritis; and identifying disc drusen versus papilledema.\nWith an understanding of ultrasound principles, thorough examination techniques, and knowledge of ultrasound characteristics of a variety of intraocular pathologies, the ophthalmologist includes B-scan ultrasound of the eye as a vital part of the diagnostic armamentarium. Without this tool, the clinician may not be able to detect or manage a variety of ocular diseases. However, as with any technical skill, B-scan ultrasound requires training, time, and experience to achieve a high level of confidence and high-quality imaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Bedside Ultrasonography Evaluation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nUltrasonography for the detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been shown to be sensitive, specific, and relatively simple to perform.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] Plummer et al demonstrated its utility as a point-of-care test in the emergency department (ED) by showing faster time to diagnosis and higher rate of survival of ruptured AAA.\n [5] Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS), which is performed at the bedside by physicians who are not specialists in imaging, has become possible thanks to technological advances that have led to use of a device with greater portability while maintaining image quality. Increasing use of POCUS in different specialties has made possible expanded physical examinations, timely decisions about patient care, and performance of safer medical procedures.\n [6]  Further validation studies have shown that emergency medicine (EM) residents and, by extension, appropriately trained EM physicians are able to quickly and accurately identify AAA using ultrasound at the bedside.\n [7] \nThe most commonly used definition of an AAA is a maximum infrarenal abdominal aortic diameter greater than 3 cm on ultrasound or CT.\n [8, 9, 10] \n\n\nPOCUS performed by a physician at the bedside is standard practice in obstetric, emergency, and musculoskeletal medicine. When compared with formal sonography, POCUS is equivalent to screening for AAA and is as accurate in diagnosing deep venous thrombosis.\n [11] \nIt is important to remember, however, that while bedside ultrasonography can be especially useful in an unstable patient who cannot leave the ED or other acute care patient setting for computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, it should never delay potentially lifesaving abdominal surgery when such surgery is immediately available and the diagnosis is strongly suspected.\n [12]  In outpatient clinics, urgent care centers, and EDs, where ultrasound imaging may be delayed by hours or even days, POCUS can prove very helpful. POCUS can facilitate patient triage and allow diagnostic information to be gathered quickly.\n [13] \n\n\n\n\nRupture of an AAA often results in death, with a mortality of 85-90%. The risk of rupture of AAAs less than 4 cm diameter is negligible, but the risk increases dramatically once the diameter reaches 5 cm, with the risk of rupture increasting to 30-50% for diameters greater than 8 cm. Although CT is considered the modality of choice for a ruptured AAA, ultrasound is better than CT at identifying intraluminal fissures, inhomogeneities, and dissections. The presence and characteristics of an intraluminal thrombus on ultrasound may help identify the risk of rupture.\n [8, 9, 10]  \n\n\n\n\nA leaking or ruptured AAA classically presents in patients who are older than 60 years who have a history of hypertension and atherosclerosis and who experience severe abdominal, back, or flank pain after an episode of syncope.\n [14] Although AAA is more common in men than in women, the incidence of rupture is greater in women because the growth rate of AAA is significantly greater in women than in men.\n [15] \n\nUnfortunately, less than 50% of patients with ruptured AAA present with the classic triad of syncope followed by back, flank, or abdominal pain and a pulsatile abdominal mass.\n [16] Up to 30-60% of patients with AAA are initially misdiagnosed.\n [17, 18, 19, 20] Be careful not to confuse AAA with more benign diagnoses such as renal colic, mechanical back pain, or diverticulitis.\n\nMaintain a high index of suspicion in patients older than 60 years who present with pain in the abdomen, back, flank, or groin. Other risk factors include family history of AAA, male sex, and history of hypertension, smoking, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or peripheral arterial disease.\n [8] \n\nAdditionally, in at-risk patients who may present with an unrelated chief complaint, emergency ultrasonography can be a fast and accurate method for identifying patients with AAA who may benefit from follow-up or intervention.\n [21] The main disadvantage of bedside ultrasonography is that a leaking or ruptured aneurysm can be difficult to distinguish from an enlarged but nonruptured aneurysm. The aorta can also be difficult to visualize when the patient is obese or bowel gas is present.\n [22] \n\nGupta et al studied the variability of aortic measurements performed by a non-physician using POCUS versus standard of care (SOC) by a registered vascular technologist or performance of abdominal/pelvic CT. Overall average aortic diameter measurements obtained were 4.1 ± 0.9 cm for POCUS and 4.0 ± 0.9 cm for SOC; the average difference in aortic measurements between POCUS and SOC was -0.1 ± 0.3 cm.\n [23] \n\nThe abdominal aorta is said to have an aneurysm when the distal aorta is dilated to a diameter larger than 3 cm.\n [24] An AAA typically enlarges at a rate of 2-8 mm/yr. Because enlargement results in an increasing incidence of rupture\n [25] (eg, a 7-cm AAA has a 19-32% rate of rupture per year) and because the mortality rate is much lower with elective repair than with emergency repair (3-5% vs 50%), the general recommendation is that AAAs larger than 5.0-5.5 cm should be electively repaired.\n [24, 26] \n\nIndications\nIndications for bedside ultrasonography include the following\n [27] :\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspicion of AAA\n\n\n\n\nAs a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of patients older than 60 years who present with nonspecific pain in the back, flank, abdomen, or groin\n\n\n\n\nFor rapid evaluation of an unstable patient in the ED or other acute care patient setting while the surgical team is assembling and resuscitation is ongoing\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends the following\n [28, 29] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          One-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65-75 years who have ever smoked.\n         \n\n\n\n          Selective screening for AAA in men aged 65-75 years who have never smoked.\n         \n\n\n\n          Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA in women aged 65-75 years who have ever smoked.\n         \n\n\n\n          Recommendation against routine screening for AAA in women who have never smoked.\n         \n\n\nContraindications\nAbdominal ultrasonography should not be performed if it would delay definitive care by means of abdominal surgery.

Because clinical examinations and laboratory evaluations do not have by themselves adequate sensitivity and specificity to accurately diagnose many of these entities, the evaluation for gallstone or gallbladder-related disease includes ultrasonography. Point-of-care bedside ultrasound has been shown to be a viable imaging modality for the diagnosis of gallstones and gallbladder-related diseases.\n [1]  Focused bedside ultrasonography (BUS) is an increasingly available and helpful diagnostic tool that can further evaluate patients with suspected biliary disease.\n [2] In one study, test characteristics of emergency physician bedside ultrasonography were similar to those of radiology-performed ultrasonography for detection of cholecystitis.\n [3, 4] Bedside ultrasonography for gallbladder disease is also a skill that can be learned by physicians at all levels of training.\n [5, 6, 7] \nThe benefits of focused bedside biliary sonography include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases the time to diagnosis for cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\nHelps accurately diagnose biliary pathology,\n [8, 9]  with a sensitivity of 90-96%, specificty of 88-96%, positive predictive value of 88-99%, and negative predictive value of 73-96%.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nHelps assess the degree of obstruction in choledocholithiasis.\n\n\n\n\nCan help diagnose gallstones definitively, which makes alternative diagnoses less likely.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nCan be performed rapidly at the bedside.\n\n\n\n\nCan provide bedside radiographic corroboration of physical examination findings for the treating physician.\n\n\n\n\nDoes not involve ionizing radiation and, as such, is safe in pregnant patients and children.\n [12] \n\n\n\n\nNecessary equipment includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nUltrasound machine with color flow Doppler.\n\n\n\n\nLow-frequency (2-5 MHz) curvilinear or phased array transducer.\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic coupling gel.\n\n\n\n\nAppropriate materials to drape the patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients should be evaluated in the supine position but can be positioned in the upright, standing, or left lateral decubitus position for improved visualization.

        "Bedside Ultrasonography for Lumbar Puncture": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nLumbar puncture is a common emergency department procedure used to obtain information about the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for diagnostic and, less commonly, therapeutic reasons. Lumbar puncture is typically performed via “blind” surface landmark guidance. However, the use of bedside ultrasonography for the identification of the pertinent landmarks for lumbar puncture is a safe and easy alternative to the blind technique.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nThe surface landmark technique is reported to be successful in a high percentage of attempted lumbar punctures; however, surface landmark identification of underlying structures has been shown to be accurate only 30% of the time.\n [1] Unsuccessful identification of proper landmarks often leads to increased difficulty in obtaining CSF, if the procedure is performed, and a higher rate of complications. Few alternatives are available in these cases. If available, fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture may be performed. If not, treatment is sometimes initiated empirically without obtaining CSF. Disadvantages of using fluoroscopy include limited availability or necessary transport of the patient outside of the ED, inability to directly visualize the spinal canal, and inherent radiation exposure.\n [5, 6, 7, 8] \n\n\nBedside ultrasound may be used in advance of attempted lumbar puncture in order to predict ease of performance or anticipated difficult lumbar puncture.\n [9] Ultrasound-guided lumbar puncture was originally reported over 30 years ago in Russian literature, and it is routinely used by many anesthesiologists for epidural and spinal anesthesia.\nUltrasound-guided lumbar puncture is most helpful in those patients in whom surface landmark–guided lumbar puncture is difficult (eg, patients who are obese or have spinal disorders). Studies have shown that bedside ultrasonography has helped operators identify the pertinent landmarks for lumbar puncture approximately 75% of the time in obese patients.\n [5, 10] It is an available and helpful modality that can decrease the number of attempts and minimize complications.\n [5, 10] Ultrasonographic guidance has been shown to increase the overall success rate of lumbar puncture and to reduce the operator's perceived difficulty of performing the procedure. This is particularly true in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more.\n [11]  Ultrasound can also reveal other anatomical information, such as depth of the ligamentum flavum and width of the interspinous spaces, which are useful to guide LP.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nNumerous pediatric studies on the use of ultrasound for performing LP have shown that ultrasonography can help reduce the number of taps, improve identification of insertion sites, and decrease pain and complications.\n [4, 12, 6, 13, 14] \n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, studies in neonates and children have used bedside ultrasonography to attempt to determine optimal positioning for lumbar puncture. Using ultrasound to measure the interspinous space at L3-L4 and L4-L5 in varying positions, the lumbar spine was found to be maximally positioned in both neonates and children in the seated position with flexed hips versus the lateral recumbent position with neck flexion.\n [15, 16] The sitting position may be optimal in adults as well.\n\nIn a study of 19 pediatric patients, ultrasound was associated with a significantly higher average confidence score for identifying a needle insertion site, versus the landmark procedure (4.79 vs 2.89 using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test).\n [17] \n\nIn 9 patients aged 7 weeks to 16 years, all ultrasound-guided lumbar punctures were successful in identifying relevant anatomy (including the conus in children 10 years and younger), confirming intrathecal injection, visualizing intrathecal hematoma, and avoiding radiation.\n [18] \n\nIn one study, researchers reported there were fewer traumatic LPs (>1,000 RBC/HPF) in the ultrasound group (19.4% vs. 29.7% in the standard palpation group). Regarding the overall median number of attempts needed to obtain fluid, 21% in the ultrasound group needed 3 or more attempts, versus 40% in the standard-palpation group.\n [19] \n\nNo anesthesia is required when using bedside ultrasonography to identify appropriate landmarks. However, local anesthesia is required prior to performing the actual lumbar puncture.

        "Bedside Ultrasonography for Pneumothorax": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe use of bedside ultrasonography in the emergency department (ED) has revolutionized patient care.\n [1]  Trauma patients, who are particularly vulnerable to the complications of delayed diagnostic studies, have benefited tremendously from rapid ultrasound-guided evaluation at the bedside.\n [2, 3, 4]  The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma has given a level 2 recommendation for the use of thoracic ultrasound to diagnose pneumothorax.\n [5]  The focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination is considered the standard of care for rapid evaluation of trauma patients. Extended FAST (eFAST) is the use of ultrasonography to identify the presence of a pneumothorax.\n [6, 7] \nA pneumothorax is the presence of air or gas in the pleural cavity, which can impair oxygenation and/or ventilation. If the pneumothorax is significant, it can cause a shift of the mediastinum and compromise hemodynamic stability. Air can enter the intrapleural space through a communication from the chest wall (ie, trauma) or through the lung parenchyma across the visceral pleura.\n\n\nThe traditional initial evaluation of patients with a suspected traumatic pneumothorax was with chest radiography, typically performed with the patient in the supine position so as to preserve cervical spine immobilization. However, this method is grossly inadequate for detecting pneumothoraces, with sensitivities as low as 36–48% in some studies.\n [8]  Given the low sensitivity of portable chest x-ray, ultrasound has also been suggested as an alternative to portable chest x-ray in the detection of traumatic pneumothorax.\n [9, 10]  \nIn a retrospective review performed at a level I trauma center, ultrasound was shown to predict the absence of pneumothorax with 93.8% sensitivity and a negative predictive value of 99.9% when compared to chest x-ray.  One pneumothorax was missed on ultrasound that was visualized on chest x-ray; however, this was a small, low anterior pneumothorax that was not clinically significant. All patients in this study who required tube thoracostomy placement had pneumothoraces that were detected on ultrasound. These findings suggest that for clinically significant pneumothoraces, ultrasound is a feasible alternative or replacement for portable chest x-ray, as it is more readily available and has higher sensitivity.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nBhoil et al performed a  prospective, single-blinded study of 118 thoracoabdominal trauma patients who underwent ultrasound FAST and supine (AP) chest radiography, as well as  thoracic CT within 3 hours of the sonographic/radiographic evaluation or the presence of air escape on chest tube insertion. True positives on CT/chest tube insertion were identified in 48 patients (37 positive on CT and 11 having air escape on chest tube insertion). In these 48 patients, ultrasound was able to correctly detect pneumothorax in 43 patients, but only 33 patients were correctly identified on supine chest radiographs.\n [12] \n\n\n\n\nIn a retrospective study, the diagnostic accuracy of the e-FAST was compared to that of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and of invasive interventions. With the use of CT scanning, 87 pneumothoraces were detected among the 763 lung fields studies; with the use of ultrasound, 67 of 87 pneumothoraces were detected. Of the 20 missed, 17 were considered mild and not life-threatening. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound in this study was found to have a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 99.8%. Although ultrasonography may not be as diagnostically accurate as CT scanning, CT is limited in unstable patients, and this limitation can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n [13]   \n\nAlthough bedside ultrasonography was first implemented by emergency medicine physicians, it is now used by multiple specialties, including radiologists,\n [14] surgeons, and adult and pediatric intensivists.\n [15, 16] Furthermore, in addition to its traditional use in the ED, bedside ultrasound is starting to be used to confirm central line placement\n [17] and to monitor postoperative patients.\n [18, 19] Studies have also shown that bedside ultrasonography is a valuable tool in diagnosing iatrogenic pneumothoraces.\n [20] In the past few years, there has been an international effort to standardize the application of lung ultrasound, and in 2011, the International Liaison Committee on Lung Ultrasound (ILC-LUS) published a set of evidence-based recommendations for lung ultrasound, including the application of ultrasound for the detection of pneumothorax.\n [21] \n\nUltrasound use has also been suggested as a feasible diagnostic tool in the prehospital setting. In a transport vehicle, ambient noise and movement may limit physical exam and delay diagnosis. In a prospective, observational study, nonphysician aeromedical providers were trained to perform and interpret thoracic ultrasound in the detection of pneumothoraces in adult trauma patients and adult medical patients requiring endotracheal intubation. Twenty pneumothoraces and one mainstem intubation were identified, of which 16 were correctly identified and the mainstem intubation was incorrectly diagnosed. Prehospital ultrasound had a sensitivity of 68% (95% confidence interval (CI) 46-85%), a specificity of 96% (95% CI 90-98%), and an overall accuracy of 91% (95% CI 85-95%). In comparison, ED ultrasound had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 62-94%), a specificity of 98% (95% CI 93-99%), and an accuracy of 96% (95% CI 90-98%).\n [22] \n\nIndications\nIt is critical to maintain a high suspicion for a pneumothorax in all trauma patients with a significant mechanism, as well as in nontrauma patients with a history or physical findings suggestive of the diagnosis.\n\nPneumothorax should be considered in the following clinical situations:\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetrating trauma to the thorax and abdomen\n\n\n\n\nBlunt trauma to the thorax or abdomen\n\n\n\n\nBlunt trauma with a significant mechanism (eg, a high-speed motor vehicle accident or a major fall)\n\n\n\n\nMultiple-trauma patients\n\n\n\n\nPost-procedures involving the thorax (eg, thoracentesis, internal jugular or subclavian central line placement)\n\n\n\nThe following signs are suggestive of pneumothorax:\n\n\n\n\n\nRespiratory distress\n\n\n\n\nDecreased or absent lung sounds, especially if unilateral\n\n\n\n\nResistance to ventilation (eg, patients who are \"hard to bag\")\n\n\n\n\nHypoxia\n\n\n\n\nTachycardia (a nonspecific but common finding)\n\n\n\n\nJugular venous distention\n\n\n\n\nTracheal deviation (a late finding in tension pneumothorax)\n\n\n\nThe following symptoms are suggestive of pneumothorax:\n\n\n\n\n\nDyspnea\n\n\n\n\nChest pain\n\n\n\n\nAnxiety\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThere are no specific contraindications for bedside ultrasonography in the ED; clinical judgment should be used to determine its appropriate application. Patients with significant pulmonary disease and previous pneumothoraces may have altered findings on ultrasound examinations. In these special circumstances, patients should undergo definitive imaging with thoracic CT scanning when stable.\n\nTechnical considerations\nSuccessful application of ultrasonography to the detection of pneumothorax requires a solid understanding of the basic anatomy and pathophysiology of the pulmonary system. Both lungs are divided into lobes. The gross functional subunits of each lung are called segments. The right lung comprises 10 segments: 3 in the right upper lobe (apical, anterior and medial), 2 in the right middle lobe (medial and lateral), and 5 in the right lower lobe (superior, medial, anterior, lateral, and posterior). The left lung comprises 8 segments: 4 in the left upper lobe (apicoposterior, anterior, superior lingula, and inferior lingula) and 4 in the left lower lobe (superior, anteromedial, lateral, and posterior). For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Lung Anatomy.\n\nNormally, the lungs are covered by a continuous serous membrane that folds back on itself to create 2 layers: the visceral pleura, which covers the lungs and adjoining structures, and the parietal pleura, which is attached to the chest wall. The pleural cavity is the \"potential\" space between these closely apposed layers and is normally filled with a small amount of pleural fluid, which allows for normal lung sliding during respiration. In normal circumstances, negative pressure prevents air from entering the pleural space.\n\nA pneumothorax occurs when air infiltrates the pleural cavity, either as a result of traumatic injury to the chest wall or spontaneously (spontaneous pneumothorax is historically believed to be caused by the rupture of pleural blebs). Although there are many risk factors that predispose patients to the development of a pneumothorax, most patients presenting to the ED have pneumothorax secondary to trauma.\n\nA particularly dangerous complication, the dreaded tension pneumothorax, can develop when an injury to the lung parenchyma or bronchus acts as a 1-way valve, allowing air to enter the pleural cavity but preventing it from escaping. A tension pneumothorax can develop rapidly and is greatly exacerbated by positive-pressure ventilation, posing a great danger to intubated patients. For all of these reasons, rapid detection of pneumothoraces in trauma patients is critical, and bedside ultrasonography is a fast, reliable means of accomplishing this task.\n\nThe following considerations should be kept in mind in the performance of the procedure (see Technique):\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall pneumothoraces tend to show the lung point in the anterior chest, whereas larger pneumothoraces have their transition areas on the lateral chest\n [23] \n\n\n\n\nSubcutaneous emphysema and pleural effusions may obscure visualization, and patients with these conditions should be examined with thoracic CT whenever possible\n\n\n\n\nIn intubated patients, the lack of pleural sliding and the absence of comet-tail artifacts do not always indicate a pneumothorax; mainstem intubation and poor ventilation should be considered in the differential (with mainstem intubation, most frequently on the right side, the other lung collapses completely, so that no lung sliding will be seen on the collapsed side)\n\n\n\n\nIt is often helpful to compare the 2 sides of the chest to each other; however, pneumothoraces may also occur bilaterally\n\n\n\nExpected outcomes\nThe use of ultrasonography to detect pneumothoraces was first described in 1987.\n [24] Since then, numerous studies have been published describing this application of ultrasonography and documenting its significantly better sensitivity and specificity in comparison with chest radiography.\n [25, 26, 27] According to the review by the ILC-LUS, lung ultrasound may be more effective at ruling out pneumothorax than ruling in the diagnosis, as compared to supine anterior chest radiography.\n [21] Although ultrasonography is widely used in emergency and critical care settings for rapid diagnosis of potentially life-threatening conditions, its utility and reliability remain controversial among some specialists.\n [28] \n\nIn a 2009 analysis of all published papers on the topic, the overall sensitivity of transthoracic ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pneumothorax ranged from 58.9% to 100%, and the specificity ranged from 94% to 100%.\n [25] A standardized technique for performing the procedure and specific sonographic signs indicating a pneumothorax have been described and validated in the literature, and these have been incorporated into the core curriculum in emergency medicine.\n [29] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Bone Scan": "\nBackground\n\n\nA bone scan images the metabolic activity of the skeleton. This has traditionally been accomplished by imaging a radionuclide whose physiology closely mimics a metabolic process within bone. Nuclear scintigraphy of the bone commonly utilizes the radionuclides technetium-99m (Tc-99m) or fluoride-18 (F-18). Tc-99m is usually attached to medronic acid (Tc-99m MDP), and F-18 is usually incorporated into sodium fluoride (F-18 NaF). These molecules are injected intravenously, and a nuclear camera that contains a salt crystal captures the decay of photons from the radioisotope. This is achieved through the process of scintillation or fluorescence that occurs when the photon emitted by the radionuclide hits the salt crystal within the nuclear camera. The scintillations are then digitized and converted to images for interpretation by a nuclear medicine physician. Other imaging options in nuclear medicine include F18-FDG PET/CT or radiolabeled white blood cell (WBC) scan using Indium-111 or Tc-99m-HMPAO-labeled WBCs.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nThere is an increased risk of radiation effects when a person's cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from diagnostic medical imaging exceeds 100 mSv. In an effort to further understand these potential risks, the International Atomic Energy Agency has launched a global effort to have individuals track their cumulative radiation exposure from medical imaging.\n [7] \n\n\nTechnetium-99m MDP\nTc-99m MDP is used for gamma camera imaging. The standard adult dose is approximately 740 MBq. Tc-99m emits 140 keV gamma rays upon decay, and these gamma rays are detected by nuclear gamma cameras to allow localizing where the Tc-99m travels within the body. For imaging bone metabolism, the radionuclide is usually attached to medronic acid (methylene diphosphonate). Caution is recommended when it is used in pregnant or nursing women. There have been rare reports of allergic reactions to Tc-99m MDP, and medical equipment should be available to treat severe reactions.\n [8] The radiation exposure from a standard adult dose of 740 MBq is approximately 4.2 mSv.\n [9] \n\n\n\n\n(See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTc-99m MDP whole body bone scan showing typical anterior and posterior planar views. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFluoride-18 NaF\nF-18 NaF is used for bone scans with positron emission tomography (PET). The standard adult dose is approximately 185 MBq. F-18 is a radionuclide that decays by positron emission. A decay positron then annihilates with an electron to form two 512-keV photons that travel in approximately opposite directions, 180° apart. PET cameras (PET scanners) are able to detect these photons and thereby map molecular flow of the F-18 NaF. There are no known adverse reactions to F-18 NaF,\n [10, 11] although there is a theoretical small risk from the radiation exposure of approximately 5 mSv. Caution is recommended when it is used in pregnant or nursing women. There is a theoretical risk of an allergic reaction, but these are virtually unheard of because the minuscule amounts administered are thought to be too small to trigger an allergic reaction.\n\n(See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18F-NaF PET/CT bone scan. This is the PET-only MIP image seen from the anterior view. It demonstrates degenerative disease in the right lower lumbar spine, which was confirmed by review of the CT images. The scan otherwise shows normal NaF tracer uptake. Note tracer uptake in the ureters, which can be better localized by review of the axial images and by delayed imaging after voiding. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nDrugs that may interfere with bone scans\nDrugs that may interfere with bone scintigraphy include aluminum-containing compounds, corticosteroids, iron, methotrexate, nifedipine, hematopoietic growth factors, androgen-deprivation therapy drugs, estrogens, bisphosphonates, drugs that interfere with osteoblastic function, nephrotoxic chemotherapy, and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. If a previous bone scan was thought to be nondiagnostic because of interference from one of these drugs, the scan should be repeated when the patient has stopped taking the medication long enough to minimize interference.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging": "\nBackground\n\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique used for diagnostic imaging. MRI is particularly useful for the imaging of soft tissues. Therefore, MRI allows for high-quality imaging of the brain with good anatomic detail and offers more sensitivity and specificity than other imaging modalities for many types of neurologic conditions. MRI also offers significant flexibility with the use of contrast agents and combinations of different sequence types.\n [1] \nImage segmentation is one of the primary tasks in image analysis. In brain MRI analysis, image segmentation is commonly used for measuring and visualizing the brain's anatomic structures; analyzing brain changes; and delineating pathologic regions.\n [2]  Therapeutic uses of MRI in the brain also exist. For example, MRI-guided radiotherapy is frequently used for brain tumors.\n [3] MRI is also used for neurosurgical planning and neurointerventional radiologic procedures, although specialized nonmagnetic equipment is required for the latter.\n\n\nMRI utilizes the varying content of hydrogen atoms contained within different tissues. Specifically, hydrogen atoms, which have their own magnetic field based on the direction of their spin, are aligned to a strong magnetic field generated by the MRI machine. The MRI machine subsequently generates an electromagnetic pulse that is at the adequate frequency to be absorbed by the hydrogen atoms.\n [4] This absorbed pulse causes the hydrogen atoms to enter an excited state, thereby changing the spin of the hydrogen atoms and misaligning them from the magnetic field. With time, hydrogen atoms return to their original relaxed state and become aligned with the magnetic field once again.\n [1] This happens at different rates depending on the tissue they are contained within. In returning to their relaxed state, hydrogen atoms also generate a radiofrequency pulse, which is detected and converted into an image that can be used for diagnostic purposes.\n [4] \nPrior to the procedure, patients need to be assessed for the presence of any contraindications. This entails passing the safety criteria and clearing the physical requirements. Patients must not exceed the maximum weight that can be supported by the table and must also be able to fit into the magnetic bore, which often has a 60 cm diameter.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nThe types of sequences to be conducted on the scan must be planned beforehand. Some conditions require particular sequences for sufficient diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it is often helpful to indicate the results of a history and clinical examination on the requisition form. There are also standardized protocols for various conditions that can also be used, such as for stroke or Alzheimer disease.\n [5, 6]  The need for contrast administration must also be assessed in light of the suspected pathology, as well as the patient’s kidney function and allergies.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nIf there is any uncertainty as to the presence of metal objects, plain radiography can be helpful.\n\nTissue contrast in MRI may be based on the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nWater/fat/protein content\n\n\n\n\nMetabolic compounds (eg, choline, creatine, N-acetylaspartate, lactate)\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic properties of specific molecules (eg, hemoglobin)\n\n\n\n\nProton density\n\n\n\n\nDiffusion of water\n\n\n\n\nPerfusion (capillary blood flow)\n\n\n\n\nBulk flow (large vessels, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF])\n [4] \n\n\n\nFaster acquisitions and development of advanced MRI sequences, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion imaging, functional MR imaging (fMRI), and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), as well as the use of higher magnetic field strengths, have made MRI an important tool for detailed evaluation of the developing brain.\n [8, 9] \n\nSubsequent to the scans, anywhere from 100-1000 high-resolution 2-dimensional images are produced directly in multiple planes. Three-dimensional reconstruction is also possible. Quantitative analysis may also be conducted, allowing the identification of regions of interest (ROI).\n [4]  These images can reveal pathology or abnormal anatomy and can further guide management of the patient.\n\nSee also the Medscape articles on Brain Herniation Imaging, Brain Aneurysm Imaging, and Brain Abscess Imaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Breast Cancer Lymphoscintigraphy (Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping)": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nLymphoscintigraphy (sentinel lymph node mapping) is an imaging technique that is used to identify the lymph drainage basin, determine the number of sentinel nodes, differentiate sentinel nodes from subsequent nodes, locate the sentinel node in an unexpected location, and mark the sentinel node over the skin for biopsy. Lymphoscintigraphy is indicated for proven palpable or nonpalpable invasive breast carcinoma for which removal of the primary tumor and axillary node dissection would be indicated.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nThe sentinel lymph node, which can be identified by a radioisotope, visual dye, or both, is based on the principle that primary tumors drain to one or or more lymph nodes before they spread widely. If the sentinel lymph node is negative for metastasis, it is likely that the neoplasm is still within the location of the primary tumor. Lymph nodes are the most common location for metastasis, with a strong correlation between metastasis in the lymphatic system and prognosis. Systemic therapy is more likely to be needed if a distant metastasis is identified. Advances include MR lymphangiography and intranodal lymphangiogram.\n [1] \n\n\nSentinel node mapping is rapidly becoming an alternative staging procedure for the axilla in managing early breast cancer.\n [5] Several well-conducted studies have provided high-quality evidence for its usefulness.\n [6] Sentinel node scanning was initially studied in cutaneous melanomas to detect lymphatic drainage patterns before surgery.\n [2] The procedure is applicable to almost all regions of the body, but the greatest impetus to the technique came with the application of the procedure to identify breast sentinel nodes.\nThe sentinel node is the first node to receive metastatic deposits in a malignancy. Lymphoscintigraphy is an important procedure because if the sentinel node is free of metastasis, subsequent nodes are also likely to be free of disease. The sentinel node is generally defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe node closest to the primary lesion\n\n\n\n\nThe node with a radioactive channel leading to it\n\n\n\n\nThe node with the highest count rate on lymphoscintigraphic imaging and probe counting\n\n\n\n\nThe first node visible on lymphoscintigraphic imaging\n\n\n\n\nThe blue node on dye injection technique\n\n\n\n\nThe node with a blue channel leading to it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLymphoscintigraphy allows the patient to avoid axillary clearance surgery (axillary lymph node dissection) if the sentinel node is negative for metastatic disease. Given the high prevalence of breast cancer worldwide, the possibility of avoiding axillary clearance surgery in a significant number of patients makes this an extremely valuable procedure.\n\nLymphoscintigraphy is the staging modality of choice for early breast cancer, and breast cancer trials with 5- to 10-year outcome data have shown no significant differences in disease-free survival rates or overall survival rates between lymphoscintigraphy and axial lymph node dissection but have shown significantly lower morbidity with lymphoscintigraphy.\n [7] \n\nAbsolute contraindications to lymphoscintigraphy include clinically positive (N1) axilla and allergy to component used.\n [5] \n\nRelative contraindications to lymphoscintigraphy include the following\n [8] :\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior biopsy (especially excisional biopsy)\n\n\n\n\nPrevious breast and axillary surgery\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced disease (associated with fatty degeneration of nodes with reduced function)\n\n\n\n\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy\n\n\n\n\nMulticentric and multifocal disease\n\n\n\n\nDuctal carcinoma in situ\n\n\n\n\nHigh body mass index and old age\n\n\n\n\nPregnancy\n\n\n\n\nSurgeon’s experience and skills\n\n\n\nLymphoscintigraphy has become widely accepted in several other applications besides breast cancer,\n [9, 10] including malignant melanoma (stage I and II disease).\n [11, 7, 12] Technetium-99m tilmanocept is also used for intradermal or SC injection for melanoma mapping.\n [13] The Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial concluded that sentinel node scanning is a low-morbidity procedure for evaluating the regional nodal basin in early melanoma and should become the standard of care.\n [14] Other applications include head and neck cancer, thyroid cancer, non–small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer,\n [10] penile cancer,\n [15] and vulvar cancers.\n [16] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Breast Positron Emission Tomography": "\nBackground\n\n\nBreast positron emission tomography (PET) is an organ-specific high-resolution technology that is used to visualize the metabolism of the breast. PET scanning is a nuclear medicine technique that images the flow of molecules in the body. This is made possible by attaching a radionuclide to a molecule that enters into metabolic pathways; the photons emitted when the radionuclide decays are then imaged. While anatomic imaging allows visualization of body structures, PET molecular imaging allows visualization of molecular flow and metabolic processes within the body.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \nThe primary benefit of PET imaging is that diseases such as cancer often first manifest as disordered metabolism before anatomic changes can be seen.\n [6, 7] In addition, dense breast tissue or scarring may cause anatomic techniques (mammography, MRI, ultrasonography) to be indeterminate. In such cases, knowing whether an anatomic structure is glucose hypermetabolic can be critical in the determination of proper medical management.\n [8, 9] \n\n\nBreast PET typically utilizes the radiotracer F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) to image glucose metabolism\n [10, 11] ; however, other radiotracers are under development. L-methyl-[11C]-methionine ([11C]C-MET) is one of the first radiolabeled amino acids used to assess amino acid metabolism in PET imaging. Uptake of [18F]F-FACBC ([18F]-fluciclovine) has been shown to be higher in breast cancer lesions than in benign lesions and healthy breast tissue, with a higher uptake in patients with a higher tumor grade. In some studies, [11C]C-labeled tyrosine (L-[1-11C]C-tyrosine), has been shown to be more accurate than F-18 FDG in differentiating malignant lesions from benign lesions, and [18F]-(2S, 4R)4-fluoroglutamine ([18F]F-FGln), has been used in the assessment of glutamine pool changes in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]  \nA tracer with great promise is [18F]fluoroestradiol (FES), which can be used for whole-body assessment of estrogen-receptor status. The FDA approval of FES-PET was based on the excellent ability to predict estrogen-receptor expression status on pathology; patients with a positive FES-PET have estrogen receptors on immunohistochemistry. The presence of estrogen receptors is the only factor that can predict the effectiveness of endocrine therapy.\n [18, 19, 20] \n\n\n\n\nWhole-body PET cameras are typically combined with a CT scanner to allow acquisition of anatomic and molecular information from a single procedure. These hybrid PET/CT cameras are donut-shaped. During the procedure, the patient is passed through the central hole of the camera. PET/CT cameras have the detector several centimeters away from the body surface, which limits scan resolution.\n\n\n\n\nWhile PET/CT cameras are useful for whole-body imaging, breast-specific PET imaging, known as positron emission mammography (PEM), requires the PET camera to be configured like a mammography machine. PEM cameras utilize 2 small movable flat detectors that are pressed directly against the breast.\n [21, 22, 23]  In a study of PEM alone, PET-CT alone, and combined PET-CT and PEM, the sensitivity rates were 72%, 60%, and 76%, respectively; specificity rates were 98%, 100%, and 98%, respectively; and accuracy rates were 85%, 79%, and 87%, respectively.\n [23] \n\nThe camera technology utilized by PEM has been shown to be more sensitive than whole-body PET/CT imaging in the detection of breast tumors.\n [1, 4] \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade III multifocal infiltrating ductal carcinoma as seen on F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography . This organ specific positron imaging technique results in a much higher resolution (down to 1 to 2 mm) compared to whole body PET/CT imaging. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nSueoka and associates compared the sensitivity of dedicated breast positron emission tomography (DbPET) with that of whole-body PET (WBPET) in detecting invasive breast cancer based on tumor size and biology. Results showed that the overall sensitivity of DbPET was higher than that of WBPET (91.4% vs 80.3%). Investigators concluded that DbPET is superior to WBPET in detecting subcentimetric, low-grade breast cancers.\n [24] \n\nIn a retrospective evaluation, Sasada and colleagues compared findings of WBPET and DbPET in patients with breast cancer according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of breast tumors. They reported that DbPET had high sensitivity and SUVmax values for all histologic types that showed low sensitivity of detection on WBPET, except lobular carcinoma in situ.\n [25] \n\nClassification of breast tumors according to uptake patterns and metabolic parameters on ring-type DbPET has been shown to be useful for detecting breast cancer. Sasada et al investigated the performance of DbPET for incidental findings that were not detected by mammography and ultrasonography and found that uptake patterns, lesion-to-background ratio, and hereditary risk are useful for predicting breast cancer risk in incidental DbPET findings.\n [26] \n\nIn a study by Muduly et al of 45 patients who had undergone 18-FDG PET-CT scanning for breast cancer, there was a significant correlation of molecular subtype with SUVmax of the primary lesion. Higher primary SUVmax was associated with higher T stage and higher histologic grade. \n [27] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Breast Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe first known clinical use of breast ultrasound (US) was reported in 1951 by Wild and Neal,\n [1] who used A-mode sonography to describe the features of one benign and one malignant breast mass. Several attempts were subsequently made to develop automated or multitransducer scanners to evaluate the whole breast, both to detect subclinical disease (screening) as well as for lesion characterization.\n [2]  With increasing resolution and quality of US imaging, the use of ultrasonography for breast scanning has increased.\n [3]  Ultrasonography has been playing an increasingly important role in the evaluation of breast cancer. US is useful in the evaluation of palpable masses that are mammographically occult, of clinically suspected breast lesions in women younger than 30 years, and of many abnormalities seen on mammograms.\n [4, 5, 6, 7]  \n(An image depicting the breast structures visible on ultrasound can be seen below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagrammatic representation of breast structures visible on ultrasound. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nIndications\nUltrasound is primarily used in the diagnostic setting in the presence of a palpable abnormality or when a previous mammogram has demonstrated a focal lesion. To its advantage, both dense and fat-replaced breasts can be well evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor indications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPalpable abnormality\n\n\n\n\nFocal abnormality on mammography\n\n\n\n\nBreast pain\n\n\n\n\nNipple discharge\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up of lesions not biopsied (mostly BIRADS-3 lesions)\n\n\n\n\nDetermination of lesion extent in patients with suspicious or malignant nodules\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of regional lymph nodes in patients with suspicious or malignant lesions\n\n\n\n\nGuiding interventional procedures\n\n\n\nAttempts have been made to establish a place for ultrasound in screening. The American College of Radiology Imaging Network has published data on whole breast ultrasound screening (ACRIN6666), showing that the cancer detection rate with ultrasonography can be comparable to that with mammography in some cases.\n [5]  Given the laborious protocol of screening whole breasts, widespread screening applications are expected to appear only when automated breast scanners have demonstrated ease of use and a sensitivity and specificity comparable to handheld breast screening.\n [6, 7] \n\nUltrasound is inherently operator dependent, and breast ultrasound even more so; thus, a major contraindication is inadequate operator experience. Ultrasound equipment with a high-resolution linear transducer is necessary. Transducers with 7-MHz to 12-MHz frequency are preferred because of better near-field resolution.\n [6]  The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that breast ultrasound be performed with a high-resolution, real-time, linear-array, broad-bandwidth transducer operating at a center frequency of at least 12-MHz and preferably higher. Other transducers may be utilized in special circumstances. Focal zones should be electronically adjustable. In general, the highest frequency capable of adequate penetration to the depth of interest should be used.\n [8] \n\nTwo large studies of screening ultrasonography for breast cancer are the Japan Strategic Anti-Cancer Randomized Trial (J-START) (72,998 women; 36 139 women in the mammography plus ultrasonography arm) and a report from an Austrian population–based screening program (66,680 women overall and 31,918 women with dense breasts). In the J-START study, the cancer detection rate was 3.3 per 1000 screens in the mammography arm and 3.9 per 1000 screens in the mammography plus ultrasonography arm (increase of 0.6 per 1000 screens).\n [9, 10]  In the Austrian study, the cancer detection rate with mammography alone was 3.5 per 1000 screens, which increased to 4.0 per 1000 screens when ultrasonography was added. In those women with dense breasts, the cancer detection rate with mammography alone was 1.8 per 1000 screens, which increased to 2.4 per 1000 screens when ultrasonography was added.\n [9, 11] \n\n A systematic review conducted for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found that ultrasound after a negative mammogram had a sensitivity of 80-83%, specificity of 86-95%, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 3-8%.\n [12, 13] \n\nEquipment and settings\nToo deep a focus causes volume-averaging artifacts and gives erroneous results about tissue consistency. Matrix probes that can also be focused in the short axis offer better resolution.\n\nEven with high-resolution probes, the focal zone (indicated by moving small arrowheads at the side of the screen) must be kept either at the lesion or just deep to it for best resolution. When surveying the breast, the focal zone should be placed at the level of the mammary zone, improving resolution of this region, where most breast disease occurs. When a lesion is identified, positioning of the focal zone at or just below the lesion helps optimize the resolution of the lesion and its posterior features.\n [14] \n\nMachines with panoramic view (extended field of view) options are often useful because this allows very large areas to be collated into a single image. Some machines offer an extended imaging field (trapezoid imaging), while in others, the 2 split fields can be appended to image more of a larger lesion. However, note that one must avoid using the panoramic images for measurements. \n\nCurrent-generation ultrasound machines offer additional image processing facilities, including spatial compounding, speckle reduction, harmonic imaging, and speed-of-sound imaging that offer enhanced resolution. These modes should be used and optimized for each patient.\n [15] \n\nAdditional features include elastography that color-codes tissue hardness, adding information that can be useful in certain conditions, as well as microcalcification imaging that enhances the presence of calcium particles.\n\nAn acoustic stand-off pad is helpful in imaging very superficial lesions.\n\nMachine settings should be optimized for breast ultrasound. This includes appropriate focal depth, an optimal gain, time gain compression (TGC; usually the default, without any curve), a high dynamic range, and contrast and high edge enhancement settings. The depth of field should extend to the pleural echoes.\n\nWhen optimized, the fat should appear medium gray in the premammary as well as the retromammary space.\n\nPositioning\nGenerally the following positions are used:\n\n\n\n\n\nMedial lesions: The patient is supine, with the ipsilateral arm over patient’s head.\n\n\n\n\nLateral lesions: The patient is opposite posterior oblique, with the ipsilateral arm over the patient’s head. The degree of obliquity depends on the breast size, pendulousness, and the location of the lesion within the breast. With large breasts, a complete decubitus position might be the best.\n\n\n\n\nIf a lesion is superficially located and is palpable in the erect position, the patient should be examined, at least for a part of the procedure in this position. Remember that the breast appears thicker in the erect position, so this is not appropriate for posterior lesions.\n\n\n\n\nSuperior lesions: The patient is supine, opposite posterior oblique or sitting, with the ipsilateral arm over the patient’s head.\n\n\n\n\nInferior lesions: The patient is supine, and the breast can be held superiorly.\n\n\n\nVarying degrees of pressure are used to flatten the breast parenchyma as well as bring the conical surface of the glandular tissue into a more orthogonal plane.\n\nGiven the real-time dynamic nature of ultrasound imaging and the tendency of the breast to change its shape with gravity, the patient position should be optimized to the examination.\n [16] This may be done several times to allow the acquisition of high-quality, reproducible images. Different positions are especially useful in large breasts. Inadequate positioning may cause portions of the breast to become inaccessible, the breast to fall over the transducer, or the lesions to appear displaced on follow-up examinations. Small breasts with little soft tissue to glide over the chest wall can be examined in the supine position.\n\nAnatomy\nThe breast is a modified sweat gland located between 2 layers of the superficial pectoral fascia on the anterior thorax, between the second and sixth ribs (see the image below).\n [17] The 2 layers can sometimes be seen behind the skin echo and in front of the pectoral muscle echoes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the breast. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nTwelve to 20 ducts exist, and their lobules, along with fat and stroma, make up the parenchyma of the breast. The breast ducts converge at the nipple at one end, and at the other end, they branch to terminate in lobules. The duct size varies from about 1 mm at the lobules to up to 5-8 mm near the nipple. The lobules are on an average 3 mm in the greatest diameter. The ratio of the parenchyma to the fat varies by the individual and even in the same woman at different ages and during pregnancy and lactation.\n\nBefore moving on to breast ultrasound anatomy, understand that the reference tissue in the breast is the fat, and structures are labeled as hypoechoic, isoechoic, or hyperechoic with reference to fat.\n\nUltrasound shows certain discrete structures that can be recognized. From superficial to deep, they are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin: This is recognized as a thin hyperechoic to isoechoic zone between 2 thinner hyperechoic lines. Usually, this is 2 mm or less in thickness but is slightly thicker over the areolae.\n\n\n\n\nSubcutaneous fat (premammary fat): This is the reference tissue. Premammary fat is more hypoechoic than fat elsewhere and has a lobular structure, with the fat lobules surrounded by a very thin echogenic layer.\n\n\n\n\nParenchyma: This layer appears as an echogenic plate; this can be homogeneous in some women, but can be heterogeneous, almost tigroid in appearance in others, especially in young women. This can also vary in echogenicity from echogenic in usual cases to almost isoechoic in lactating breasts. Within the parenchyma ducts, the terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) can be seen occasionally.\n\n\n\nThe ducts can be seen as thin echogenic lines representing collapsed and apposed duct walls, or lines surrounded by a hypoechoic zone that is the loose stromal tissue surrounding the ducts. Frequently, only the isoechoic periductal stromal tissue is seen, giving the almost striped (tigroid) appearance. With progressive accumulation of intraductal fluid, the ducts can appear as tubes that can be up to 5 mm across. Duct ectasia becomes more frequent with age, and almost 50% of women have ectatic ducts by 50 years of age. Duct ectasia is mostly an incidental finding but may be associated with discharge and periductal mastitis.\n\nWith very high resolution images, TDLUs are sometimes seen as small hypoechoic elongated or rounded structures. These are usually located peripherally in the parenchymal plate—more numerous in the anterior part than the posterior part.\n [18] \n\nCooper ligaments attach to the parenchymal surface from the anterior mammary fascia and can be seen as thin echogenic bands, widening as these insert into the anterior parenchymal surface. A few Cooper ligaments are seen posteriorly as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Cardiac Evaluation Using Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nPatients who present to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion are often tachycardic or even hypotensive. Unfortunately, history and physical examination alone often lack the sensitivity and specificity to accurately diagnose the underlying etiology. Ultrasonography is frequently used in the ED in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and in evaluation of critically ill patients because of its bedside applicability, rapidness, and inexpensive cost. Focused cardiac ultrasonography performed by emergency physicians has been shown to be sufficient in terms of accuracy of findings and diagnosis.\n [1]  Focused bedside echocardiography (FBE) is a valuable and increasingly available imaging modality that can be used to better manage these patients.\n [2, 3, 4, 5] \nWhen emergent interventions such as intubation, fluid resuscitation, or pressors are indicated, FBE should not delay the initiation of such treatment. While FBE can be difficult to perform in patients presenting in extremis or during ongoing resuscitations, the information obtained through FBE can be lifesaving. Anesthesia is generally not necessary for sonographic evaluation of the heart, great vessels, and pleural spaces.\n\n\nBenefits of FBE include the following: \n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases time to diagnosis for pericardial effusions.\n [6, 7] \n\n\n\n\nHelps diagnose pericardial effusions in cases of pulseless electrical activity.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\nHelps assess left ventricular function, even with limited views\n [8, 9] or in the setting of hypotension.\n [10, 11] \n\n\n\n\nHelps assess volume status and central venous pressure (CVP).\n [12] \n\n\n\n\nHelps diagnose decompensated congestive heart failure. (FBE has been shown in some instances to be even more accurate than chest radiographs.\n [13] It can be used alone or in conjunction with N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide [NT-ProBNP] levels to help differentiate between congestive heart failure [CHF] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] in patients with shortness of breath.\n [14] )\n\n\n\n\nHelps diagnose deep vein thrombosis.(DVT)\n\n\n\n\nWhile not sensitive for pulmonary embolism (PE), FBE findings can prompt pursuit of this diagnosis or risk-stratify those patients who are found to have PE.\n [15, 16, 17] \n\n\n\n\nCan be learned and integrated into clinical practice with limited training.\n [13, 16, 18, 19, 20] \n\n\n\n\nCan be performed at the bedside to avoid removing critically ill patients from the immediate clinical area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of FBE include the following:\n\n\n\nSubxiphoid 4-chamber view\n\nParasternal long-axis and short-axis views\n\nApical 4-chamber view\n\nSubxiphoid long-axis view of the inferior vena cava (for assessment of CVP and volume status)\n\nAssessment of the internal jugular vein (for assessment of CVP and volume status)\n\nExamination of the femoral and popliteal veins (if DVT is suspected).\n\n\n\n\n\nIndications for FBE include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAny patient presenting with chest pain, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion\n\n\n\n\nCode or arrest situations such as pulseless electrical activity (PEA)\n\n\n\n\nSuspected left- or right-sided heart failure\n\n\n\n\nSuspected pulmonary embolism\n\n\n\n\nSuspected cardiac tamponade\n\n\n\n\nUnexplained hypotension\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of central venous pressure and volume status\n\n\n\nOn average, most patients have at least one good or adequate view of the heart (subxiphoid, parasternal, or apical). If a given view is difficult to obtain, try dragging the probe cephalad or caudad one interspace or toward the sternum or midclavicular line. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) tend to have poor parasternal views but good subxiphoid views, as their hyperexpanded lungs tend to push the heart inferiorly. Patients who are obese tend to have poorer subxiphoid views and better parasternal views.\n\nIf the subxiphoid view is difficult to obtain because of bowel gas, the transducer-probe should be used to perform gentle, graded compression. This can often stimulate the bowel to peristalse out of the way. Another technique is to reattempt the view from a position just to the right of midline while trying to use more of the liver as an acoustic window.\n\nThe parasternal long-axis (PLA) view should visualize the aortic root. If the aortic root is absent, the image is most likely oblique. In this case, angle the transducer slightly in either direction to optimize the image.\n\nThe parasternal short-axis view should be obtained with the image plane at the level of the papillary muscles. This ensures a true transverse cut through the left ventricle and allows for proper evaluation of left ventricle function.\n\nIf the meniscus of the internal jugular (IJ) vein is not identifiable, try having the patient sit up (if central venous pressure [CVP] is high, the top of the IJ may be impossible to see unless the patient sits up) or lie down (if CVP is low, the top of the IJ may be impossible to see unless the patient lies down).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Carotid Ultrasound": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nCarotid ultrasonography (CUS) is a useful diagnostic tool for assessing cervical carotid artery disease. CUS can be highly reliable with proper technique; has no radiation risk; is well tolerated by all patients, including those who are claustrophobic in MRI machines; and has fewer risks than conventional angiography. The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis Trial, and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial have helped establish guidelines for possible interventions based on CUS results. Further, intimal-medial thickness measurements are associated with an increased stroke risk.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \nTrials include ACT-1,\n [6, 7]  Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial-2, Stent-Protected Angioplasty in asymptomatic Carotid artery stenosis versus Endarterectomy Trial-2, European Carotid Surgery Trial-2, and Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial-2. These trials include diverse populations across Europe and North America to help provide clinicians with evidence that informs best clinical practice for asymptomatic carotid artery disease.\n [8] \n\n\nCUS has some pitfalls when quantification of stenosis is attempted by spectral blood velocity parameters. In particular, for stenoses within the low (< 50%) to moderate (50-70%) range, intrastenotic velocity increases only slowly relative to the luminal loss, thereby resulting in a lack of diagnostic accuracy that often requires additional morphologic estimation of plaque stenosis in B-mode or color-Doppler ultrasonography images according to the NASCET method.\n [9] \nIn a study of handheld ultrasound versus conventional ultrasound for carotid plaque assessment of the carotid arteries of 200 patients referred for coronary angiography, the handheld device was found to be comparable to that of the conventional ultrasound system. The maximum plaque height (MPH) and total plaque area (TPA) of the carotid artery bulbs were measured. There was good correlation and no relevant bias between handheld and conventional ultrasound in measuring MPH (r = 0.84, P< 0.0001) and TPA (r = 0.94, P< 0.0001). In addition, there was good inter-rater reliability for online and offline measurements of MPH and offline measurements of TPA by handheld ultrasound (0.79, 0.76 and 0.85, respectively).\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Deep Vein Thrombosis Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nVenous thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and a frequent cause of presentation in many emergency departments (EDs). The sequelae of deep vein thromboses (DVTs) range from the more common chronic venous stasis to the most serious pulmonary emboli (PE). PEs have been described as one of the most common preventable causes of death, and approximately two thirds of PEs are estimated to originate in the lower extremities as DVTs. The rate of propagation from DVT to PE is estimated to be 10-50%. Treatments with anticoagulation or Greenfield filter placement are extremely effective if used early, thereby underscoring the need for rapid diagnosis.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] \nCompression ultrasonography has proven to be a highly sensitive and specific modality for the recognition of lower extremity DVTs without the need for radiation or contrast exposure.\n [14, 15] Traditional lower extremity studies interrogate and review the entire lower extremity vasculature, are performed by an ultrasonography technologist, and are read by a radiologist.\n [16, 17] However, these factors are not always available and have been shown to delay the time to diagnosis and potential treatment of a DVT by up to 2 hours.\n [18, 6] \n\n\nPatients who have risk factors for DVT or PE, and in whom a clinician suspects DVT or PE, should have workups that include, but are not necessarily limited to, bedside compression ultrasonography.\nAlthough the gold standard for the diagnosis of DVT is contrast venography, point-of-care compression ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly being used in the ED for evaluation of lower extremity DVT. Two primary types of of POCUS have been used to diagnose DVT: 2 point and 3 point. The 2-point technique tests the compressibility of the common femoral vein (CFV) and the popliteal vein (PV), and the 3-point technique tests the compressibility of the CFV, the superficial femoral vein (SFV), and PV.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 19, 20, 5, 21] \n\n\n\n\nTo detect proximal lower extremity DVTs, EDs now use a modified 2-point compression technique that focuses on the highest probability areas, decreases the study time to less than 5 minutes, and provides similar sensitivity and specificity.\n [7, 8, 9]  In patients with a clinically suspected DVT, a negative compression ultrasound study may safely delay the need for anticoagulation therapy.\n [22]  The 2-point DVT compression examination has been assessed in multiple randomized, controlled studies and is well accepted when used properly with pretest probability assessments.\n [7, 23, 24, 25] \n\n\n\n\nIn a study of limited-compression ultrasound (LC US), the standalone sensitivity and specificity of LC US were 91% (95% CI = 70-98%) and 97% (95% CI = 92-99%), respectively. According to the authors, incorporating LC US into the diagnostic approach would have reduced the rate of comprehensive imaging from 70% to 43%; D-dimer testing from 100% to 33%; and the mean time to diagnostic certainty by 5 hours. However, the investigators cautioned that although LC US holds promise as one component of the diagnostic approach to DVT, it should not be used as a standalone test because of imperfect sensitivity.\n [26] \n\nIn a systematic review and meta-analysis, Pomero et al compared emergency physician–performed ultrasound (EPPU) with color-flow duplex ultrasound (performed by a radiology department or vascular laboratory) and with angiography to diagnose DVT. The weighted mean sensitivity of EPPU compared to the reference imaging test was 96.1% (95% CI = 90.6-98.5%), and weighted mean specificity was 96.8% (95% CI = 94.6-98.1%).\n [10] \n\nIn a study by Tatarano et al of the use of lower-limb venous compression ultrasonography (CUS) to screen for DVT in patients undergoing urologic surgery, it took 30 minutes per patient to screen for DVT by CUS. The benefit of DVT screening was to avoid postoperative venous thromboembolism that may be caused by the use of a perioperative intermittent pneumatic compression device. The researchers proposed age >70 years and/or D-dimer level ≥1.8 µg/mL as indications for patients who should undergo pre-DVT screening by CUS.\n [27] \n\nA number of studies have been performed regarding detection of DVT by ultrasonography during the early post–spinal cord injury period. Ultrasound screening of the lower extremity venous system 2-21 days after spinal cord injury resulted in a diagnosis of DVT in 21-45% of patients.\n [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] \n\nA substudy of the Pneumatic Compression for Preventing Venous Thromboembolism (PREVENT) trial reported that twice-weekly ultrasound surveillance of critically ill patients increased DVT detection and reduced diagnostic testing for non–lower limb DVT and PE. The study also found that patients with DVT and PE were diagnosed earlier and had lower 90-day mortality.\n [35] \n\nThe safety, ease of use, rapid time to diagnosis, low cost, and accessibility make bedside ultrasonography for DVT especially useful for emergency and critical care clinicians.\n [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 23] \n\nHowever, a meta-analysis evaluating the use of ultrasonography for detection of suspected lower-limb proximal and distal DVT in asymptomatic patients found low sensitivity with missed diagnosis of lower-limb DVT in approximately 50% of cases.\n [36]   \n\nBlanco and Volpicelli, in presenting pitfalls to be avoided with bedside ultrasound, noted that DVT should be differentiated from rouleaux in that veins with rouleaux formations are compressible, unlike true thrombosis. To rule in or out a more proximal venous obstruction in the presence of rouleaux, the authors recommended that the operator look for direct visualization of a thrombus or examine compressibility of the proximal veins.\n [11] \n\nIf the clinical suspicion and pretest probability for a PE are high enough that a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast or V/Q (ventilation/perfusion) scan is warranted, then ultrasonography should not delay such studies or any further treatment goals. Additionally, thrombus in the pelvic veins will not be detected with this technique and, although rare, may be best evaluated with CT or magnetic resonance (MR) venography.\n [37] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Diagnosis of Head and Neck Lesions With Ultrasonography": "\nBackground\n\n\nPractice essentials\nUltrasonography is one of the few diagnostic modalities that can be done at the bedside and offers many advantages over other modalities. It is readily accessible and portable, and images are viewed in real time. In addition, it is less expensive and noninvasive than other modalities. Sedation and contrast dye are rarely needed; however, newer studies with contrast are emerging. Most importantly, it is a safe study and, thus, is the first recommended imaging of choice for pregnant women and children.\n [1] \n\n\nUltrasonography does have some limitations. The accuracy and effectiveness relies on the experience and skill of the operator for image acquisition and the physician for image interpretation. Furthermore, it is a study whose resulting outcome varies, depending on the patient’s body habitus and cooperation. Lastly, ultrasonography requires a window that is unimpeded by bone or air, limiting the type of evaluations it offers, when compared with CT scanning or MRI.\nFor the head or neck evaluation, a high-resolution, small-part transducer with higher frequencies is used, most commonly between 7.5 and 10 MHz, but ranging from 5-20 MHz. The higher the frequency, the better the spatial resolution. According to American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) recommendations, mean frequencies of 10-14 MHz or greater are preferred.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nPoint-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the head and neck plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of upper airway stenosis, swelling, and painful diseases of the neck, as well as evaluation for swallowing problems. A linear probe with a frequency of around 10 MHz and a field of view of around 40 mm is suitable for head and neck POCUS. Upper airway POCUS should also be performed for dyspnea.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nUltrasound-guided nerve blocks are commonly performed by pain physicians because of advantages over fluoroscopy in that ultrasonography is portable, is radiation-free, and offers real-time imaging.\n [4] \n\nUltrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for head and neck malignancy has been found to be highly reliable and specific. In a study by Petrone et al, only 8 samples of 301 lesions (2.6%) were considered nondiagnostic. Cytologic-histologic correspondence was 89%. Overall sensitivity was 92.75, and specificity was 94.6%.\n [5] \n\nUltrasound-guided core needle biopsy (USCNB) for head and neck lymphoma has been shown to be a successful diagnostic technique. In one study, by Cuenca-Himenez, USCNB was diagnostic of lymphoma in 215 of 226 (95.1%) patients. Eleven patients required a subsequent surgical excision biopsy for diagnosis.\n [6]  \n\nThyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, and parathyroid hormone testing are useful screening tests for patients with clinical concern for thyroid disease or hyperparathyroidism, respectively.\n\nB-mode ultrasonography shows the texture and tissue borders as black and white pictures. Color duplex ultrasonography allows for visualization of moving tissues and blood flow. Doppler ultrasonography allows differentiation of the vessels. With the different modalities combined, it allows the reader to evaluate for hyperemia, vessels relative to pathologic findings, inflammatory changes, and the components of the structure being investigated.\n\nTranscranial Doppler ultrasonography is used to assess intracranial blood flow velocity, emboli, stenosis, and vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is also used to diagnose right-to-left cardiac shunting, most commonly a patent foramen ovale, in patients after a stroke.\n\nDefinitions and guidelines\n\nBasic understanding is needed of the structures of the head and neck as well as knowledge of how sound waves create real-time images. Key principles and definitions of ultrasound are described:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Echogenicity is the ability of a surface to bounce an echo or return a signal. Hyperechoic structures are more “bright” than their surroundings, whereas hypoechoic structures are less “bright” than their surroundings. Anechoic structures appear black, without echoes; whereas isoechoic structures have the same echoes as their surroundings, which means it appears as bright as its surroundings.\n         \n\n\n\n          Acoustic impedance is transmission and reflection across 2 different boundaries/surfaces. Acoustic shadowing shows areas through which sound waves fail to propagate. Acoustic enhancement is when no echoes are reflected and sound is allowed to pass through, allowing echoes deep to the anechoic structures to be visible. Fluid-filled structures provide acoustic enhancement, making the structures/area inferior to it brighter. \n         \n\n\n\n          Refraction is produced from the multiple reflections from an object if the acoustical impedances of tissue layers are too different. Attenuation is the reduction of the ultrasound beam as it passes through a medium.\n         \n\n\nThe American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), in conjunction with the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, has published guidelines on the use of head and neck ultrasound examination for the following\n [7] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Salivary glands\n         \n\n\n\n          Lymph nodes\n         \n\n\n\n          Congenital lesions\n         \n\n\n\n          Miscellaneous mass lesions\n         \n\n\n\n          Infection and trauma\n         \n\n\n\n          Endocrine glands\n         \n\n\nThe European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) has described training requirements for head and neck ultrasound on the basis of 3 EFSUMB competency levels, as follows\n [8] : \n\n\n\n\n\n          Level 1 involves the knowledge and skills needed to perform essential head and neck ultrasound examinations independently.\n         \n\n\n\n          Level 2 describes the skills needed to perform ultrasound-guided interventions. Practitioners who need to perform ultrasound-guided interventions in clinical work would be expected to hold Level I and Level 2 competencies and skills.\n         \n\n\n\n          Level 3 involves training and practice on a more advanced level and requires additional knowledge of advanced ultrasound technologies and engagement in education or research.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "DICOM in Dentistry": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nDigital imaging is increasingly used for evaluation of dental caries, oral pathology, and presurgical and preorthodontic treatment assessment.\n [1, 2] With this conversion from legacy to digital imaging has emerged the need for a software strategy that allows the communication of patient, diagnostic, and other acquisition data along with the imaging information. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging.\n [3] \nA DICOM file contains a patient's x-ray image or series of images and other patient-related information (eg, patient name, identification number, acquisition modality) as selected from a library of standardized terms. The DICOM library is extensive and continually updated to reflect changing identification standards. DICOM files are fully encrypted to allow safe electronic communication over the internet.\n\n\nDICOM standards were first developed by the American College of Radiology and National Electrical Manufacturers Association. These standards are regularly revised to improve compatibility with electronic records and improve clinical workflow in the medical environment. By using a standardized format, the images and associated data can be viewed regardless of the proprietary acquisition modality that was used to take the imaging study, allowing for cross-vendor interoperability or connectivity. Dentists are also able to communicate with their medical colleagues via HIPAA-compliant internet connections.\nDentistry has been actively involved in formulation of DICOM standards since 1996, when the American Dental Association joined the DICOM Committee. As a result, DICOM standards began to include definitions for image objects, with special categorization for intraoral projections and color photography. Today, most companies producing imaging devices (termed acquisition modalities) include DICOM image identification. Numerous software systems (termed picture archiving and communication systems, or PACS) have been developed to allow for the storage, retrieval, and viewing of digital DICOM images.\n\n\n\n\nMuch work still needs to be done before dentistry is fully integrated with respect to DICOM. For example, DICOM images need to be integrated with the many electronic dental record software products currently available.

The most common location is the fallopian tubes.\n [1]  Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in any woman in the first trimester of pregnancy who has abdominal or pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or both.\n [2, 3, 4]   The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is 1-2% and is still the most common cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester, accounting for about 10% of all pregnancy-related deaths. Missed ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause of emergency medicine malpractice claims.\n [5, 6, 7, 8] \nHigh-risk features for the possibility of ectopic pregnancy include history of ectopic pregnancy, history of pelvic inflammatory disease, use of an intrauterine device, and history of tubal surgery. Unfortunately, clinical findings alone cannot reliably diagnose or exclude ectopic pregnancy.\n [9, 10, 11] \n\n\nBedside ultrasonography is indicated in the presence of vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain in a patient in the first trimester of pregnancy. Do not perform bedside ultrasonography if it delays resuscitation or definitive surgical care in an unstable patient.\nSeveral studies have validated pelvic ultrasonography in the acute care setting, specifically in the emergency department (ED), as diagnostically accurate and beneficial for flow.\n [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] \n\n\n\n\nOne meta-analysis of emergency physician–performed ultrasonography as a diagnostic test for ectopic pregnancy found that it had a sensitivity of 99.3% and a negative predictive value of 99.96% for detecting an intrauterine pregnancy. Given a disease prevalence of 7.5% and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.08, visualization of intrauterine pregnancy by an emergency physician yields a posttest probability of ectopic pregnancy of 0.6%.\n [19] A retrospective study of 585 women over a 2.5-year period concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for the detection of ectopic pregnancy was 88.5% and 96.5% on the first ultrasound and 93.1% and 95.7% after an additional scan.\n [20] \n\n\n\n\nAn early diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy is necessary, because it is the leading cause of first-trimester maternal death. There have also been reports of an increase in mortality in patients with late post-hysterectomy ectopic pregnancy.\n [21] \n\nA study by Stone et al revealed that compared to radiology department–performed ultrasound (RADUS) alone, incorporation of point-of care ultrasound (POCUS) was associated with significantly faster ED treatment time for all ectopic pregnancies and significantly faster time to the operating room (OR) for ruptured ectopic pregnancies, even when combined with RADUS. The average ED treatment time in the POCUS group for all admitted ectopic pregnancies was 157.9 minutes versus 206.3 minutes in the RADUS group. The median time to OR for ruptured ectopic pregnancies was 203.0 minutes in the POCUS group versus 293.0 min in the RADUS group.\n [22] \n\nUrquhart et al found that ED patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy who first received POCUS had shorter times to diagnosis, obstetric consultation, and/or arrival as compared to those who received RADUS. Comparing times between POCUS and RADUS groups, the mean time from ED arrival to ultrasound interpretation was 15 minutes versus 138 minutes, from ED arrival to obstetric consultation was 35 minutes versus 150 minutes, from ED arrival to OR arrival was 160 minutes versus 381 minutes, and from ultrasound interpretation to OR arrival was 145 minutes versus 243 minutes.\n [23]  \n\nIn a first-trimester study of ultrasound features for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, an empty uterus was found to predict an ectopic pregnancy with a sensitivity of 81.1% and a specificity of 79.5%. Sensitivity and specificity for a pseudosac, adnexal mass, and free fluid were as follows: 5.5% and 94.2%; 63.5% and 91.4%; and 47.2% and 92.3%, respectively.\n [24] \n\nBedside ultrasonography is an important tool for emergency medicine clinicians and other acute care clinicians to use in assessing patients’ risk for potential ectopic pregnancy. Early diagnosis can be very valuable in lessening morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis before tubal rupture can prevent life-threatening hemorrhage and increase the probability that the patient may be managed medically or via tube-conserving surgery.\n\nHowever, use of ultrasonographic imaging should never preclude adequate resuscitation or definitive surgical therapy in a patient who is hemodynamically unstable and in whom ectopic pregnancy is strongly suspected.\n\nEctopic pregnancy can usually be reliably excluded in patients with a demonstrated IUP; heterotopic pregnancy remains very rare in patients who are not taking fertility agents. Risk factors for heterotopic pregnancy include a family history of multiple gestations, endometriosis, tubal disease, pelvic inflammation, and high female hormone levels. The risk also increases with higher numbers of transferred embryos. Heterotopic pregnancies occur in approximately 1 in 5,000 pregnancies, but the incidence increases to as high as 1 in 100 in women undergoing fertility stimulation or procedures.\n [25] \n\nThis limited diagnostic focus differs from that of the ultrasonography performed by the radiology department and has also been called point-of-care limited ultrasonography (PLUS). When the serum level of beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) is higher than 1500 mIU/mL, the level known as the discriminatory zone, transvaginal ultrasonographic findings of an IUP should be present (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransverse picture of intrauterine pregnancy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nDiagnostic, Suggestive, and Indeterminate Ultrasonographic Findings\nThe first developmental structure big enough to be visualized by transvaginal ultrasonography is the gestational sac, which appears in the endometrial cavity at around 4.5-5 weeks’ gestation (corresponding to a β-HCG level of 1000-1500 mIU/mL). Measurement of the mean sac diameter (MSD) is important for estimating the gestational age, as well as for confirming subsequent normal embryonic development.\n [26] \n\nAccording to a study by Oh et al, there was no difference in gestational sac diameter at 28-35 days after the last menstrual period in normal and abnormal pregnancies, but smaller-than-expected sac diameter in pregnancies 36-42 days after the last menstrual period was found to be predictive of spontaneous miscarriage.\n [27] \n\nA conservative definition of a sonogram diagnostic for an IUP involves demonstration of a clearly defined yolk sac within the gestational sac (see the images below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture of gestational sac with yolk sac. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransverse picture of gestational sac with yolk sac. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe yolk sac appears by 5-6 weeks’ gestation and should definitely be present when the MSD is greater than 8 mm. The embryo, or fetal pole, can be visualized on transvaginal ultrasonography by 6 weeks’ gestation and on transabdominal ultrasonography by 7 weeks’ gestation, and it should be present when the MSD exceeds 16 mm.\n\nStudies have shown that a cutoff of 25 mm can increase sensitivity to 100%.\n [28] \n\nEmbryonic cardiac activity starts to be visible at around 7 weeks’ gestation and should be visible if the crown-rump length, or fetal pole length, is greater than 5 mm.\n [29, 30] \n\nDefinitive ultrasonographic diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy is made in only about 20% of cases, when an extrauterine pregnancy is clearly identified (ie, an extrauterine gestational sac with a yolk sac or fetal pole is visualized). There exist, however, numerous findings that are highly suggestive of ectopic pregnancy, including an empty uterus in a patient with a β-hCG level above the discriminatory zone, an adnexal mass other than a simple cyst (see the image below), echogenic fluid in the cul-de-sac, or anything more than a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture of uterus without a fetal pole and a complex adnexal mass consistent with ectopic pregnancy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPatients who exhibit such findings should be managed in consultation with an obstetrician; they likely will need surgical exploration or medical therapy with methotrexate.\n\nUltrasonographic findings that are neither diagnostic nor highly suggestive of an IUP or ectopic pregnancy are classified as indeterminate. These findings include an empty uterus, an abnormal gestational sac (eg, a sac with an irregular border or an MSD large enough that a secondary structure such as a yolk sac would be expected), a normal gestational sac without a yolk sac or embryo, a nonspecific intrauterine fluid collection, and ill-defined echogenic material within the endometrial cavity (see the image below). Patients who exhibit these findings are generally monitored closely with serial β-HCG testing and clinical assessments, as about 10-25% of such patients have normal pregnancies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture of abnormal endometrium in a patient with an ectopic pregnancy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nComplications\nThere are no major complications associated with the performance of emergency department (ED) ultrasonography to evaluate first-trimester pregnancy. Sometimes, Doppler ultrasonography is used in early pregnancy evaluation to detect fetal cardiac activity or to better delineate the adjacent vascular anatomy. The energy output of Doppler ultrasonography is substantially higher than that of conventional ultrasonography and may be harmful to the embryo.\n [31] \n\nComplications can ensue if an obstetrician is not consulted early in the treatment of a patient with early pregnancy and hemodynamic instability, acute abdomen, or falling hematocrit level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Fluoroscopy": "\nBackground\n\n\nFluoroscopy is a technique that employs x-rays to generate real-time still images or video of a patient's body. The x-rays pass through the body and create an image on a detector, which is then transmitted to a monitor for viewing by the physician. Thus, a part of the body that is radio-opaque or made so by the use of a dye or a contrast agent can be visualized. Similarly, an instrument or device or movement of internal body parts can be displayed.\n [1, 2, 3] \nIt is a commonly used medical technique that helps physicians with a wide variety of diagnostic and interventional procedures. Although low doses are used, in prolonged procedures, the cumulative exposure may result in a relatively high absorbed dose to the patient. Therefore, all necessary precautions should be used, and the benefits should outweigh the potential risks in a given clinical situation.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] \n\n\nBecause fluoroscopy involves the use of ionizing radiation, it is relatively contraindicated in pregnant women because of potentially harmful effects on a developing fetus.\nThis review focuses on the use of fluoroscopy in orthopedic procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma (FAST)": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nFocused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma (FAST) is an ultrasound protocol developed to assess for hemoperitoneum and hemopericardium. The sensitivity of FAST has been measured between 85 and 96%, and specificity greater than 98%. In hypotensive trauma patients, sensitivity has approached 100%. FAST can be performed by experienced personnel in less than 5 minutes, and its use has been shown to decrease the time to surgical intervention, the patient length of stay, and the need for computed tomography (CT) and diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL). It is estimated that over 96% of level 1 trauma centers incorporate FAST into their trauma algorithms.\n [1] \nBlunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is a common reason for presentation to the emergency department (ED). Unfortunately, patient history and physical examination often lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity for accurate diagnosis of acute traumatic pathology. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was historically used to determine which patients needed exploratory laparotomy, but DPL is difficult to perform in pregnant patients, it cannot be used for serial assessment, and it is overly sensitive, which leads to a high negative laparotomy rate.\n [2]  Abdominal CT has better specificity than DPL for intra-abdominal injury in BAT, but it can be difficult to perform in hemodynamically unstable patients, it is expensive, it requires removing patients from the clinical arena, and it may be relatively contraindicated in pregnant patients.\n [3]  FAST is an important and valuable diagnostic alternative to DPL and CT that can often facilitate timely diagnosis for patients with BAT.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \n\n\nGuidelines for FAST examination have been published by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP).\n [10]  The primary FAST examination classically includes the subxiphoid window of the heart to denote pericardial fluid. Indications for FAST include evaluation of the torso for free fluid suggesting injury to the peritoneal, pericardial, and pleural cavities, particularly in cases of trauma. FAST examination may be used to evaluate the lungs for pneumothorax.\n [10, 11, 12] \nBenefits of the FAST examination include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases time to diagnosis for acute abdominal injury in BAT\n\n\n\n\nHelps accurately diagnose hemoperitoneum\n\n\n\n\nHelps assess the degree of hemoperitoneum in BAT\n\n\n\n\nIs noninvasive\n\n\n\n\nCan be integrated into the primary or secondary survey and can be performed quickly, without removing patients from the clinical arena\n\n\n\n\nCan be repeated for serial examinations\n\n\n\n\nIs safe in pregnant patients and children, as it requires less radiation than CT\n [13] \n\n\n\n\nLeads to fewer DPLs; in the proper clinical setting, can lead to fewer CT scans (patients admitted to the trauma service and to receive serial abdominal examinations)\n [14] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extended version of the standard FAST examination (E-FAST) has been established and offers additional information. Along with images of the abdomen, the E-FAST examination includes views of bilateral hemithoraces to assess for hemothorax and views of bilateral upper anterior chest walls to assess for pneumothorax.\n [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] For the remainder of this monograph, the FAST examination is referred to as the E-FAST examination, as appropriate.\n\nThe wide variation in the accuracy and reliability of FAST and E-FAST for children after blunt abdominal trauma reflects user expertise. FAST and E-FAST that are performed by expert personnel tend to be more accurate and reliable.\n [21] \n\nSeveral accepted indications have been identified for the FAST examination, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nBAT\n\n\n\n\nStable penetrating trauma\n [22] \n\n\n\n\nAssessment of the degree of intraperitoneal free fluid\n\n\n\nWhen emergency treatments such as intravenous (IV) fluids or blood transfusions are indicated, performance of a FAST examination should not delay initiation of these treatments.\n\nThe E-FAST allows clinicians to rapidly diagnose traumatic thoracoabdominal injuries at the bedside without use of ionizing radiation. It has high specificity and is extremely useful as an initial test to rule in dangerous diagnoses such as hemoperitoneum, pericardial effusion, hemothorax, and pneumothorax. Its moderate sensitivity means that it should not be used alone as a tool to rule out dangerous thoracoabdominal injuries. In patients with a mechanism or presentation of concern, additional imaging should be obtained despite a negative FAST examination.\n [23] \n\nAlthough ongoing resuscitation and a patient in extremis are not contraindications, the FAST examination can be difficult to perform in such situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Head Computed Tomography Scanning": "\nBackground\n\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning of the head is an x-ray based imaging procedure generating images of the intracranial contents as a result of specific x-ray absorption by the tissues examined (see the image below). The CT scanner generates multiple sequential cross-sectional images of the brain, and 3-dimensional images of cranium or blood vessels can be created on special software on dedicated workstations, if needed. Depending on the clinical indication, the scan can be performed with or without intravenous contrast injection. It can also be used to guide biopsies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAxial CT scan of the head showing intra cranial hemorrhage. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nIndications for head CT examination are numerous, but the most frequent include the following\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] :\n\n\n\n\n\nHead trauma\n\n\n\n\nStroke\n\n\n\n\nHeadaches\n\n\n\n\nInitial evaluation for space-occupying lesions\n\n\n\n\nUnexplained change in mental status\n\n\n\n\nSeizures\n\n\n\n\nSuspected hydrocephalus\n\n\n\n\nSuspected intracranial hematoma\n\n\n\n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\n\n\n\nDizziness\n\n\n\n\nVascular occlusive disease and aneurysm evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT scanning has no absolute contraindications. Caution is indicated in pregnant women, particularly during the first trimester to avoid fetal abnormalities. Risk-to-benefit considerations should be evaluated. Repeated x-ray exposure may increase the patient's risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small, with the benefit of an accurate diagnosis outweighing the risks. In certain clinical situations, intravenous contrast administration is indicated. Contrast media is safe in most patients; however, adverse reactions may range from mild to severe. It is recommended that nursing mothers should wait 24 hours after contrast administration to resume breastfeeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Hemodialysis Fistulas and Thrombosis": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nHemodialysis fistulas are surgically created communications between the native artery and the vein in an extremity. Direct communications are called native arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and other materials (Dacron, polyurethane, bovine vessels, saphenous veins) are used or have been used as a communication medium between the artery and the vein and are termed prosthetic hemodialysis access arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). The access that is created is routinely used for hemodialysis 2-5 times per week. Approximately 430,000 patients in the United States are dependent on hemodialysis. Options include catheters, arteriovenous grafts (AVGs), and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs).\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] \nOf the 3 primary hemodialysis access modalities—arteriovenous fistula (AVF), arteriovenous fistula graft (AVG), and indwelling central venous catheter (CVC)—AVF is associated with the lowest mortality, morbidity, and cost. Despite initiatives to increase autogenous AVF use, hemodialyis is initiated with a CVC in 83% of patients in the United States, versus only 14% iwith an AVF.\n [9] Almost 75% of patients in whom hemodialysis is initiated with a CVC remain on CVC 3 months later.\n [10, 11] \n\n\nMany patients who are not candidates for renal transplantation or those for whom a compatible donor cannot be secured are dependent on hemodialysis for their lifetime. This situation results in the long-term need for and use of dialysis access. The preservation of patent, well-functioning dialysis fistulas is one of the most difficult clinical problems in the long-term treatment of patients undergoing dialysis. As many as 25% of hospital admissions in the dialysis population have been attributed to vascular access problems, including fistula malfunction and thrombosis.\n [12]  \nWith the advent of new devices and the continuous improvement of existing devices, the percutaneous treatment of failing and occluded dialysis access will continue to improve in the future. The role of the interventional radiologist is changing. The radiologist's role has changed from that of an angiographer who makes the diagnosis into that of a physician who treats patients with chronic renal failure in coordination with the nephrologist and the vascular surgeon.\n\n\n\n\nHistory of the management of dialysis access\nHistorically, native fistula or graft malfunction and thrombosis were treated by using surgical thrombectomy and revision, resulting in the eventual exhaustion of the veins and the need to create a new access. Initially applied in the 1980s, percutaneous techniques such as balloon angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]), thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy allowed the treatment of stenosis and fistula thrombosis without surgery.\n\n\n\n\nInterventional radiologists have increasingly been involved in angiographic evaluation and treatment of malfunctioning and occluded hemodialysis access. The multidisciplinary management of dialysis access coordinated among interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and nephrologists has proven extremely effective in prolonging the patency of the vascular access and decreasing the morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic renal failure.\n [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 7] \n\n(Examples of a vessel with long-segment stenosis before and after treatment are provided below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-segment outflow vein stenosis before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage obtained after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in a long-segment stenosis (same patient as in Image above). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIndications\nLess than 15% of dialysis fistulas remain patent and can function without problems during the entire period of a patient's dependence on hemodialysis. The mean problem-free patency period after creation of native fistulas is approximately 3 years, whereas prosthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts last 1-2 years before indications of failure or thrombosis are noted. After multiple interventions to treat underlying stenosis and thrombosis, the long-term secondary patency rates for native fistulas are reportedly 7 years for fistulas in the forearm and 3-5 years for fistulas in the upper arm; prosthetic grafts remain patent for up to 2 years.\n\nCauses of dialysis fistula failures\nFistula failure and eventual occlusion occur most commonly as a result of the progressive narrowing of the venous anastomosis; for native fistulas, failure occurs most commonly as a result of the narrowing of the outflow vein. In some reports, venous anastomosis has been identified in more than 90% of grafts. The primary underlying pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for causing the failure is intimal hyperplasia at the anastomotic site. Additional causes include surgical and iatrogenic trauma, such as repeated venipunctures. Stenoses along the venous outflow and in intragraft locations (for prosthetic PTFE grafts) are also common and require appropriate treatment.\n\nWhen to consult with an interventional radiologist\nThe following are indications for consultation with an interventional radiologist:\n\n\n\n\n\nAbnormal findings on clinical examination, such as weak thrill or pulsatility\n\n\n\n\nDirect palpation of stenosis\n\n\n\n\nInsufficient inflow, such as stenosis in the supplying native artery or proximally in the subclavian or brachiocephalic artery\n\n\n\n\nVacuum phenomenon\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of high venous pressures in accordance with the protocol appropriate for the specific type of hemodialysis machine\n\n\n\n\nSuboptimal blood flow (according to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 1997 guidelines: 700-800 mL/min for prosthetic grafts and 500 mL/min for native fistulas) or recirculation while the patient receives hemodialysis\n [19] \n\n\n\n\nDemonstration of stenoses in a previous Doppler ultrasonographic examination\n\n\n\n\nIpsilateral arm edema and/or collateral venous pathways suggestive of a central venous stenosis\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThe presence of an infection is a contraindication to angiography and percutaneous treatment of a dysfunctional or thrombosed dialysis access. To avoid symptomatic pulmonary emboli, declotting should not be performed in patients with poor pulmonary or cardiac reserve.\n [20, 21] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Image-Guided Surgery": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nImage-guided surgery (IGS) is the use of a real-time correlation of the operative field to a preoperative imaging data set that reflects the precise location of a selected surgical instrument to the surrounding anatomic structures. Although first developed for neurosurgery, endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) rapidly became one of the leading indications for this technology.\n [1] \nImage-guided surgery is one of the most significant advances in endoscopic sinus surgery since the inception of the endoscopic approach in the mid-1980s. This technology enables the surgeon to follow the anatomic dissection of the sinuses on a computer monitor in the operating room in real time. Difficult anatomic relationships can more easily be understood and treated with the assurance that the critical landmarks are secured. Although the initial expense is substantial, these procedures have minimal per-case costs. The decision whether to use an optical or an electromagnetic system is less critical than the decision to use computer technology. Both systems are widely accepted and provide excellent anatomic information.\n\n\nIGS should not be considered as a way to palliate lack of experience or understanding of sinonasal surgical anatomy but rather as an adjunctive tool designed for otolaryngologists properly trained in ESS.\nIn neurosurgery, the primary use of image-guided surgery is to locate an intracranial lesion for resection or biopsy. In endoscopic sinus surgery, the main advantage is to avoid disrupting hazardous areas such as the brain and orbit. The development and rapidly growing popularity of image-guided surgery in sinus surgery are directly attributable to the risks of such disruptions.\n [2, 3, 4] \n\n\n\n\nIGS begins with obtaining a CT scan. The CT scan acquisition protocol used for the authors' needs consists of a helical, 2-mm–thickness axial CT scan with the use of a specially designed headset incorporating built-in metallic fiducial land marking. The specially designed headset allows automatic registration of the imaging to the patient's anatomy in the operating room. The imaging data set is transferred via optical disk, CD-ROM, or computer network to the operating room, where it is loaded into the workstation. The images are brought up on the IGS system prior to the procedure and checked for image quality and accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nAn image depicting image-guided surgery is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerification of accuracy using patient anatomical landmarks. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nToday, most CT scanners provide data sets compatible with commonly used guidance systems. Radiology also has the ability to provide the required data on a CD-ROM, or to transfer the images directly from the radiology station to the IGS system through a secured broadband network. These advances, as well as the decreasing cost of the technology, have allowed IGS to be available to a sizable number of otolaryngologists.\n\nImage-guided endoscopic sinus surgery is also reaching increasing acceptance in pediatric otolaryngology, although fewer reports have been published compared with the adult literature.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Intravascular ultrasonography has played a critical role in enhancing the understanding of coronary atherosclerosis pathophysiology and has facilitated the refinement of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for various vascular pathologies. Intravascular ultrasonography has become increasingly important in both clinical and research applications,\n [1] and it has played an integral role in the evolution of interventional cardiology.\n [2, 3] Intravascular ultrasonography in interventional cardiology is an adjunctive procedure to coronary angiogram; as such, any contraindication to coronary angiography applies to intravascular ultrasonography as well.\nIn general, risks and discomforts involved in IVUS include those associated with all catheterization procedures. Major complications, including dissection or vessel closure, are rare (<0.5%).

However, even these sources are generally quite limited compared to the general background radiation on Earth. The risks and benefits of radiation exposure due to medical imaging and other sources must be clearly defined for clinicians and their patients. The US National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement reported that medical x-rays and nuclear medicine account for 15% of all radiation exposures.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nThe use of ionizing radiation in medicine began with the discovery of x-rays by Roentgen in 1895. Ionizing radiation is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with sufficient energy to pass through matter and physically dislodge orbital electrons to form ions. These ions, in turn, can produce biological changes when introduced into tissue. Ionizing radiation can exist in 2 forms: as an electromagnetic wave, such as an x-ray or gamma ray, or as a particle, in the form of an alpha or beta particle, neutron, or proton.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The current preferred term for absorbed dose is gray (Gy). One rad equals 0.01 Gy or 1 centigray. However, different tissues can have different absorbed doses and, therefore, unequal biologic effects, depending on the tissue and the source of radiation. For example, 1 Gy of alpha radiation can be more harmful than 1 Gy of beta radiation because alpha particles are much larger than beta particles and carry a greater charge.\n\nThe rem is a unit that describes the equivalent dose, which accounts for the actual biological effect of radiation. The rem is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose (rad) by a quality (Q) factor or the radiation weighting factor (RWF), which reflects the differences in the amount of potential biological effect for each type of radiation. For example, beta particles, gamma rays, and x-rays have a RWF of 1.0, making their effects on tissue largely equivalent. Alpha particles, however, have a RWF of 20, which indicates a biological effect that is potentially 20 times greater than that of beta particles, gamma rays, or x-rays.\n\nThe sievert (Sv) is the unit for equivalent dose in the System International (SI) nomenclature. It indicates what is received by each irradiated organ and relative sensitivity. The equivalent dose expressed in rem or Sv gives an index of potential harm to a particular tissue or organ from exposure to different radiation types (see Table 2 above for comparison of terms).\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Joint Assessment With Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nOverview\n\n\nSince 1895, when Wilhelm Röntgen produced his first x-ray (of his wife’s hand), physicians have used imaging to \"see\" beneath the skin, having progressed from these early modalities to advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography. These nonionizing imaging modalities afford significant resolution, allowing clinicians to appreciate the structure of and anatomic relationships between joints, tendons, ligaments, and muscles.\nDespite significant technological advancements since Röntgen's discovery, patients who present with common musculoskeletal complaints are routinely still evaluated only by x-ray. It is not surprising that these studies often produce negative results, given that x-rays offer poor visualization of ligaments, muscles, and other soft tissues. MRI is the best imaging modality for anatomic detail, but expense, availability, and even claustrophobia preclude its widespread use. Additionally, MR images are limited in that they are static.\n\n\nJoint arthropathies often require continuous monitoring of the joint condition, typically performed using MRI or ultrasound (US). US imaging is often the preferred screening modality because it is fast and inexpensive.\n [1]  Ultrasonography is available in many clinical settings (eg, outpatient clinics, intensive care units, emergency departments) as an adjunct to procedural guidance and critical care evaluation. One of its main advantages is that it allows for dynamic soft tissue examination. When used to evaluate the musculoskeletal system, bedside ultrasonography can provide clinicians with valuable information that cannot be provided by radiography.\n [2, 3] \nJoint aspiration, or arthrocentesis, is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the evaluation and treatment of joint diseases. Joint aspiration may aid in diagnosis by assessing synovial fluid for the degree of inflammation and for the presence of pathologic agents such as crystals or microorganisms. Additionally, arthrocentesis may prove therapeutic in some cases by relieving intra-articular pressure and by injecting intra-articular drugs (eg, steroids).\n [4, 5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nAlthough arthrocentesis is generally safe and simple, limited physician experience or technical difficulties (eg, patient positioning, body habitus) can make some cases challenging. When this occurs, procedural guidance using ultrasonography may prove beneficial.\n [7, 8, 9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nGeneral procedures recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism for musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases include the following\n [11] :\n\n\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) includes 2 principal modes: B-mode (or gray scale), which provides morphologic information on anatomic structures, and Doppler mode (color Doppler or power Doppler), which allows evaluation of blood flow.\n\n\n\n\nMSUS should be performed with high-resolution linear transducers (ie, probes) with frequencies between 6 and 14 MHz for deep/intermediate areas to ≥15 MHz for superficial areas.\n\n\n\n\nTissue harmonic imaging, spatial compound imaging, extended field of view (panoramic), and virtual convex imaging are some of the software capabilities that may be useful in MSUS.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a joint is scanned, the probe should be oriented as perpendicular or parallel to the bony cortical surface (bony acoustic landmark) so that the cortical margin appears bright, sharp, and hyperechoic.\n\n\n\n\nA dynamic scanning technique by means of slight movements of translation (side-to-side, back-to-front), angulation, and rotation of the probe should be carried out to allow best visualization of the structure(s) of interest.\n\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal structures should be evaluated as they move smoothly either actively or passively.\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid anisotropy (ie, hypoechoic/anechoic appearance of a normally hyperechoic structure that mainly affects tendons) and the common pitfalls that accompany it, the probe should be continuously adjusted to maintain the beam perpendicular to tendon fibers, especially in insertional regions.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the long axis of the structure of interest corresponds to the cranial-caudal orientation of the anatomic position, the most proximal aspect of the structure is usually placed on the left-hand side of the screen. However, other options are acceptable as long as movement of the image on the screen is kept parallel to the direction of the probe on the patient. Our preference for short axis is to align the structure of interest on the screen as if the observer is looking at the patient.\n\n\n\n\nProbe compression can be helpful in distinguishing a compressible liquid collection from a non-compressible solid. Little or no compression is important when Doppler examination is performed to avoid cessation of flow in small vessels.\n\n\n\n\nA generous amount of gel should be used for superficial structures, especially when little or no pressure is indicated.\n\n\n\n\nThe machine setting for B-mode and Doppler mode should be properly adjusted to optimize the US image acquisition process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder (KUB) Imaging": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nVarious imaging studies can be used to evaluate patients with suspected renal or urinary tract disease.\n [1]  Renal angiography is the gold standard for direct visualization of the renal vasculature. It is invaluable in the diagnosis and prognosis of renal artery stenosis and renal vein thrombosis.\n [2]   Plain films of the abdomen are now rarely used to evaluate kidney and urinary tract disease. Renal ultrasonography is invaluable as a screening test for urinary tract dilatation (hydronephrosis), a hallmark of urinary tract obstruction. Ultrasonography remains the procedure of choice for evaluation of acquired or hereditary polycystic kidney disease.\n [3]  Color doppler ultrasonography is used to measure flow or velocity of blood in the main renal artery; it is primarily used to detect renal vascular occlusive disease.\n [4, 5, 6, 7] \nPlain abdominal films are indicated for the evaluation of radiopaque kidney stones (calcium-containing stones, struvite, cystine). An advantage of the plain film is that it can be performed in pregnant and pediatric patients, since the amount of radiation exposure is limited. \n\n\nIntravenous pyelography (IVP) can be used to detect kidney stones and delineate the level of obstruction in patients with urinary tract obstruction. \nComputed tomography (CT) is an excellent tool to evaluate masses, traumatic injury to the kidney, stones, and pyelonephritis. CT scanning is superior to ultrasonography in identifying renal cysts, since it is capable of detecting small cysts (2-3 mm in diameter).\n [5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a useful alternative to CT scanning in individuals at risk for toxicity from intravenous contrast. \n\n\n\n\nRadionuclide scanning has been successfully used to evaluate renal perfusion in various settings, including renal artery stenosis and thrombosis. Radionuclide cystography is widely used by pediatric nephrologists to detect early vesicoureteral reflux in children.\n [8] \n\nRetrograde pyelography is an essential tool for localizing the site of urinary tract obstruction. It has been replaced by ultrasonography or CT scanning in most settings but is helpful in patients with a known pelvic malignancy when hydronephrosis is absent because of ureteral encasement.\n [9] \n\nDiuretic renography is widely used to discriminate functional versus anatomic obstruction after identification of a dilated upper urinary tract (usually with ultrasonography or CT scanning).\n [10]  Two important functional aspects of kidney function can be assessed: (1) clearance of each kidney and (2) the flow of urine through the urinary tract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Magnetic Resonance Mammography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nIntroduction to breast MRI\nBreast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), also known as magnetic resonance mammography, is a noninvasive technique for imaging the breasts. It creates high-quality images of the breasts and has better sensitivity and specificity for detection of breast cancer than the other currently available technologies. Breast MRI is also used in evaluation of integrity of breast implants.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \n\n\n(See the images below.)\n\n\n\n\n\nMRI: A, Non-fat saturation T1 weighted image showing a T1 hypointense mass in the far lateral posterior aspect of the right breast.

Lesions A, B, and C were in a line, with lesion D lying higher and more central. All lesions and the retroareolar ductal enhancement were confirmed to be malignant at mastectomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn ongoing research, including the EA1141 Trial, an abbreviated-protocol breast MRI is being investigated as a lower-cost method than traditional full diagnostic protocol breast MRI, while maintaining sensitivity and specificity for breast cancer.\n [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] \n\nSee Breast Cancer for complete information on this topic.\n\nDevelopment of MRI-based breast examination\nThe breast was one of the first organs studied with MRI for the detection of cancer, albeit initially in vitro.\n [14] The breast was also the first organ in which the detection of invasive tumor neovascularity was highlighted through the application of rapid serial imaging after an injection of contrast agent.\n\nWith the clinical application of nonenhanced breast MRI, the value of T1-weighted (T1W) and T2-weighted (T2W) spin-echo imaging rapidly became clear, through the analysis of characteristics such as lesion morphology, signal intensity, and tissue relaxation times.\n\nIt also became clear that the T2 relaxation rates of benign tissues and malignant tissues overlap\n [15] and that in situ cancers could not be reliably detected at all. The development of a dedicated breast coil, rapid 2D gradient-echo (GRE) imaging, high field strength (>1T) magnets that enabled spectral fat-suppression, new methods of k-space filling to increase resolution and speed, and bolus injection of gadolinium dimeglumine created the technique of dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI. This technique showed an extremely high sensitivity for breast malignancy, higher than conventional methods of breast imaging.\n\nAlthough dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI was initially limited to a single section location, it was soon modified with newly developed multisection, spoiled GRE sequences. This thin-section dynamic contrast-enhanced technique formed the foundation of modern breast MRI. MRI-guided breast biopsy and localization methods have been developed to investigate abnormal areas seen on breast MRI.\n\n(See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical parametric color mapping software used to map the rate of contrast enhancement on a series of dynamic images acquired at the same locations over a period of time. By arbitrary convention, red and yellow represents faster and more-intense enhancement, while blue and green represent slower and weaker enhancement. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPrerequisites for the performance and interpretation of breast MRI\nBreast MRI is a highly specialized diagnostic technique that complements clinical assessment and conventional imaging with mammography and ultrasound (US). It does not replace these techniques, except in certain unusual situations. In general, breast MRI should not be performed without conventional imaging performed first.\n\nWhen breast MRI is performed for screening or evaluation of breast cancer, administration of an intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent is a must. If the patient has a contraindication to gadolinium administration, breast MRI should not be performed for evaluation of breast cancer. Non-contrast MRI of the breast should only be performed for assessment of integrity of breast implants.\n\nBreast MRI is best performed in a multidisciplinary setting with access to additional breast imaging, as well as close collaboration between the surgeon, radiologist, oncologist, and pathologist.\n\nRadiologists experienced in MRI but without a strong knowledge of breast disease and diagnosis often have major difficulties with the interpretation of breast MRI studies. The radiologist interpreting breast MRI must (1) have a thorough understanding of breast pathology and diagnostic workup of breast diseases, (2) work closely with a breast surgeon and pathologist, (3) be experienced in the interpretation of mammograms and breast sonograms, and (4) be experienced in image-guided breast biopsy techniques.\n\nRole of breast MRI in detection and evaluation of breast disease\nBreast MRI is used as an adjunct to conventional mammographic assessment.\n\nIt provides additional information in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding breast cancer not detected by other imaging modalities in women with increased risk.\n [1, 16, 2] \n\n\n\n\nFinding breast cancer not detected by other imaging modalities in women with dense breasts.\n [17] \n\n\n\n\nFinding additional disease in recently diagnosed breast cancer cases (multifocal, multicentric, or bilateral disease).\n\n\n\n\nFinding an invasive component in ductal carcinoma in situ lesions.\n [18] \n\n\n\nBreast MRI relies on detection of abnormal enhancement caused by neoangiogenesis associated with malignancy. The increasing use of breast MRI has inevitably been accompanied by increased detection of incidental enhancing abnormalities that were not detected by conventional imaging. These apparent lesions may represent normal or dysplastic tissues, cyclic hormonal changes, benign tumors, or unexpected malignant foci. The nature of such foci must be clarified so that a cancer is not missed and small cancers are identified.\n\nThree strategies are commonly used to diagnose these lesions: performing MRI-guided repeat US (second-look ultrasound), repeating breast MRI at another suitable time, or performing MRI-guided needle biopsy.\n\nIndications for performing breast MRI\nBreast MRI is costly, is not as widely available as mammography, and needs injection of contrast medium. Optimal MRI imaging of breasts is performed between days 7 and 14 of a woman's menstrual cycle to avoid the confounding background parenchymal enhancement. It can give rise to a larger number of false positives leading to unnecessary biopsies. Therefore, there are guidelines for performing breast MRI.\n [3, 19, 4, 5] \n\nThere is not enough evidence to make a recommendation for or against yearly MRI screening for women who have a moderately increased risk of breast cancer (a lifetime risk of 15-20% according to risk-assessment tools that are based mainly on family history) or who may be at increased risk of breast cancer based on certain factors, such as (1) having a personal history of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) or (2) having dense breasts (“extremely” or “heterogeneously” dense) as seen on a mammogram.\n\nIf MRI is used, it should be in addition to, not instead of, a screening mammogram. This is because although an MRI is a more sensitive test (it’s more likely to detect cancer than a mammogram), it may still miss some cancers that a mammogram would detect.\n\nFor most women at high risk, screening with MRI and mammograms should begin at age 30 years and continue for as long as a woman is in good health. However, because the evidence is limited about the best age at which to start screening, this decision should be based on shared decision-making between patients and their health care providers, taking into account personal circumstances and preferences.\n\nIndications for breast MRI in a diagnostic setting include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of extent of disease in a patient with recently diagnosed breast cancer (multifocal or bilateral disease).\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of invasive lobular carcinoma.\n [20] \n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of an indeterminate lesion after a full assessment with mammography, ultrasonography, and physical examination.\n\n\n\n\nDetection of occult primary breast carcinoma in the presence of carcinoma in axillary lymph node or metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown origin.\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation in postoperative patients with positive margins.\n\n\n\n(See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvasive ductal carcinoma detected with screening mammography. A, Detailed mammography shows this as a stellate mass with suspicious microcalcifications. However, no microcalcifications are seen extending to the nipple. B, MRI shows intense enhancement in the tumor and in an expanded duct, which extends to the nipple. The nipple enhancement is within normal limits. Histology confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) extending to, but not involving, the nipple and areola. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nBreast MRI Screening as an Adjunct to Mammography\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends annual MRI screening along with mammography, based on evidence from nonrandomized screening trials and observational studies, in women with the following risk factors\n [4] :\n\n\n\n\n\nBRCA mutation\n\n\n\n\nFirst-degree relative of BRCA carrier, but untested\n\n\n\n\nLifetime risk ∼20–25% or greater, as defined by BRCAPRO or other models that are largely dependent on family history\n\n\n\nThe ACS recommends annual MRI screening, based on expert consensus opinion that considers evidence of lifetime risk for breast cancer, in women with the following risk factors\n [4] :\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation to chest between age 10 and 30 years\n\n\n\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome or first-degree relatives with the syndrome\n\n\n\n\nCowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes or first-degree relatives with those syndromes\n\n\n\nThe ACS found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against MRI screening in women with the following risk factors \n [4] :\n\n\n\n\n\nLifetime risk 15–20%, as defined by BRCAPRO or other models that are largely dependent on family history\n\n\n\n\nLobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)\n\n\n\n\nAtypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)\n\n\n\n\nHeterogeneously or extremely dense breast on mammography\n\n\n\n\nPersonal history of breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\n\n\n\nThe ACS recommends against MRI screening (based on expert consensus opinion) in women at < 15% lifetime risk.\n\nFinally, the ACS advises that screening decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, as there may be particular factors to support MRI. Payment should not be a barrier.\n\nContraindications to performing breast MRI\n\nContraindications to breast MI include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient's inability to lie prone.\n\n\n\n\nMarked kyphosis or kyphoscoliosis.\n\n\n\n\nMarked obesity.\n\n\n\n\nExtremely large breasts.\n\n\n\n\nSevere claustrophobia.\n\n\n\n\nInability to use gadolinium-based contrast media (history of allergy to contrast media or pregnancy).\n\n\n\n\nOther general contraindications to MRI.\n\n\n\nGadolinium-based contrast agents have been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) or nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD). For more information, see Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy. The disease has occurred in patients with moderate to end-stage renal disease after being given a gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\nAdvantages of breast MRI\nThe advantages of breast MRI include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nNo ionizing radiation.\n\n\n\n\nMultiplanar capability.\n\n\n\n\nCapability of imaging the entire breast volume and chest wall.\n\n\n\n\n3-dimensional (3D) lesion mapping with techniques such as maximum intensity projection (MIP) slab 3D reconstruction.\n\n\n\n\nDetection of occult, multifocal, or residual malignancy.\n\n\n\n\nAccurate size estimation for invasive carcinoma.\n [21] \n\n\n\n\nGood spatial resolution.\n\n\n\n\nAbility to image regional lymph nodes (axillary as well as internal mammary).\n\n\n\nIn a study by Wasif et al, MRI was found to be more accurate than ultrasonography or mammography in the determination of the size of breast cancer masses. Out of 61 lesions, MRI-based tumor size was within 1 cm of pathologic size in 44 (72%) tumors, more than 1 cm above pathologic size in 6 tumors, and more than 1 cm below pathologic size in 11 tumors.\n [22] \n\nWeinstein et al concluded that the addition of MRI to mammography in patients with a high risk of breast cancer has the greatest potential to detect additional, mammographically occult cancers. The investigators prospectively compared breast cancer detection of digital mammography (DM), whole-breast US (WBUS), and contrast-enhanced MRI in a high-risk screening population that previously screened negative with film screen mammography (FSM).\n [23] \n\nIn the Weinstein study, the cancer yield by modality was evaluated, and 20 cancers were diagnosed in 18 patients (9 ductal carcinomas in situ and 11 invasive breast cancers). The overall cancer yield on a per-patient basis was 3% (18 of 609 patients). The cancer yield by modality was 1% for FSM (6 of 597 women), 1.2% for DM (7 of 569 women), 0.53% for WBUS (3 of 567 women), and 2.1% for MRI (12 of 571 women). Of the 20 cancers detected, some were detected on only one imaging modality (FSM, 1; DM, 3; WBUS, 1; MRI, 8).\n [23] \n\nMoy et al evaluated breast MRI in cases in which mammographic or ultrasonographic findings were inconclusive, and they found that MRI had a sensitivity of 100% and a significantly higher specificity than mammography (91.7% vs 80.7%, respectively). MRI also had greater positive predictive value (40% vs 8.7%) and overall accuracy (92.2% vs 78.3%).\n [24] \n\n(See the images below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpot compression MLO view showing two masses in the inframammary fold region. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame patient as in the previous mammogram: Reconstructed T1 weighted fat-saturation sagittal image of right breast shows the two masses seen on the mammogram and a third mass more superiorly and posteriorly.

However, Dang et al found that from 2003 to 2007, although the annual number of breast MRI scans ordered by their institution rose from 68 to 358, the percentage of women who underwent mastectomy did not change over that period.\n [27] \n\nDifferential diagnosis of lesions seen with breast MRI\nIf early rapid enhancement due to neovascularity were unique to malignant tissues, breast MRI would be the standard in clinical practice today. Unfortunately, such enhancement is not specific, and several benign conditions may enhance in a fashion similar to cancer. Conversely, a small percentage of malignancies either enhance identically to benign breast parenchyma or, rarely, do not enhance at all.\n\nBenign pathologies that may mimic malignant enhancement include the following (false positive):\n\n\n\n\n\nCyclical physiologic parenchymal enhancement\n\n\n\n\nFibroadenoma\n\n\n\n\nSclerosing adenosis\n\n\n\n\nFlorid epithelial hyperplasia\n\n\n\n\nLobular carcinoma in situ\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n\n\n\n\nFat necrosis\n\n\n\n\nPosttreatment scarring and/or granulation tissue\n\n\n\n\nIntraductal papilloma\n\n\n\n\nRadial scar and/or complex sclerosing lesion\n\n\n\n\nSilicone granuloma\n\n\n\nMalignancies that may show benign-type enhancement include the following (false negative):\n\n\n\n\n\nDCIS\n\n\n\n\nHighly scirrhous invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)\n\n\n\n\nInvasive lobular carcinoma\n\n\n\n\nMucinous carcinoma\n\n\n\n\nPapillary carcinoma\n\n\n\n\nTubular carcinoma\n\n\n\nMRI-guided ultrasonography (second-look US)\nWhen a suspicious finding is seen on breast MRI, high-resolution targeted US is performed to detect and evaluate the lesion, as well as to provide guidance for biopsy as needed. It is frequently possible to perform an ultrasound-guided biopsy instead of a more expensive and time-consuming MR-guided biopsy. However, one should be careful, because a malignant lesion detected by MRI may be subtle and less specific in appearance on US; therefore, careful ultrasound scanning is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Mammogram": "\nBackground\n\n\nAlthough various radiographic modalities are readily available to identify lesions that are suspicious for breast cancer, mammography remains the mainstay of breast cancer screening. The role of breast sonography is confined mainly to the diagnostic follow-up of a mammographic abnormality because it may help clarify features of a potential lesion. The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for breast cancer screening is still evolving; currently MRI screening, in combination with mammography, is reserved for the screening of high-risk patients only.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nIn 2022, an estimated 290,560 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed—287,850 in women and 2710 in men—along with an estimated 51,400 cases of in situ breast cancer in women. Approximately 43,250 women and 530 men are expected to die from breast cancer in 2022.\n [1] \n\n\n Incidence rates of invasive female breast cancer have been increasing by about 0.5% per year since the mid-2000s. In contrast, overall breast cancer death rates decreased 42% from 1989 to 2019, because of both improvement in treatments and earlier detection.\n [1] \nThe lifetime risk of a woman being diagnosed with breast cancer is 12.9%, or more than 1 in 8.\n [5]  Due to the magnitude of the disease, its psychosocial impact, and associated morbidity and mortality, screening for early diagnosis forms a pivotal part of the struggle against this cancer.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Health Interview Survey, about 70% of women age 45 to 74 year have had a mammogram within the past 2 years. Breast cancer screening rates were higher in non-Hispanic white (71.7%) and non-Hispanic black (72.9%) women compared with non-Hispanic Asian (67.0%) and Hispanic (66.3%) women.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the number of breast cancer deaths averted by screening and early treatment increases with age: over a 10-year period, screening 10,000 women aged 60-69 years will result in 21 fewer deaths from breast cancer; 8 fewer deaths in 10,000 women 50-59 years; and 3 fewer deaths in 10,000 women 40-49 years.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Myocardial Perfusion SPECT": "\nBackground\n\n\nConventional single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) evaluates the presence, extent, and degree of myocardial ischemia or infarction (ie, flow-limiting defects). SPECT is a nuclear medicine topographic imaging technique that uses gamma rays. It is similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using gamma cameras; however, the computer in SPECT provides 3-dimensional (3D) images. SPECT is based on the flow-dependent and/or metabolism-dependent selective uptake of a radioactive tracer by functional myocardial tissue. This method was developed to evaluate myocardial perfusion and viability and is applied both at rest and after exercise or pharmacologic stress to assess inducible ischemia due to flow-limiting coronary stenoses.\nMPI is widely used in patients with coronary artery disease, and reconstruction algorithms improve the diagnostic accuracy and image quality. Hybrid SPECT/CT scanning combines the 2 types of images and allows attenuation correction and reduction of scanning time.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \n\n\nThe technique involves the intravenous injection of small amounts of radioactive tracer (gamma-emitting radioisotope), which is avidly taken up by the cardiomyocytes so that the initial myocardial tracer distribution is in proportion to the viable myocardium. The use of cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) has improved the performance of SPECT  by improving detection sensitivity and spatial resolution, as well as reducing the radiation dose.\n [7, 8, 9]  The CZT detector works as a semiconductor with direct conversion of gamma radiation to electric signal.\n [10] \nThe history of cardiac nuclear medicine dates back to 1973, which marked the introduction of the exercise stress-test myocardial scan by H. William Strauss\n [11]  and the first application of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging by Elliot Lebowitz. Since then, it has been increasingly used in clinical cardiology. Technical developments that have fueled this increase are single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) imaging, pharmacologic stress, and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated imaging. ECG-gated SPECT images allow for the assessment of the global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), regional wall motion, and regional wall thickening at rest in patients with documented stress-induced wall motion and perfusion abnormalities.\n [12, 13] \n\n\n\n\nThe underlying principle is that under conditions of stress, the diseased myocardium receives less blood flow than normal myocardium. SPECT imaging performed after stress reveals the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical and, therefore, the relative blood flow to the different regions of the myocardium. Comparing stress images to a further set of images obtained at rest aids in diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\nImages taken during dynamic exercise or pharmacologically induced stress (using vasodilators such as adenosine or a beta-agonist such as dobutamine) and rest injections enable independent assessment of myocardial perfusion and viability.\n\n(Note the summary figure and other images below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice summary.

        "Obstructive Uropathy Assessment Using Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nOverview\n\n\nObstructive uropathy is a blockage of normal urinary flow. The backup of urine into the unilateral or bilateral kidneys causes hydronephrosis. Back pressure of urine into the collecting system of the kidneys may produce dilatation within the tract; as the kidneys filtration system becomes affected, it becomes the primary cause of obstructive nephropathy.\n [1]  Patients who present to the emergency department (ED) or to another ambulatory care setting commonly report abdominal and flank pain. Unfortunately, patient history and physical examination often lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity for accurate diagnosis of underlying etiologies without further testing. Focused bedside ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool that often facilitates timely diagnosis for these patients.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \nUltrasonography is especially important in determining the cause of sudden onset of abdominal or flank pain, because patients with symptomatic abdominal aneurysms can be difficult to distinguish from those with renal colic. In fact, making an accurate diagnosis of ureteronephrolithiasis is especially important, because renal colic is the most common misdiagnosis in patients with missed abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\n\nUltrasonography is the first-line imaging modality used in diagnostics of the urinary system. It provides valuable morphologic information, but its usefulness in assessment of function of the renal parenchyma is limited. Dynamic renal scintigraphy provides much more accurate information about the parenchymal function of kidneys and about urinary outflow.\n [8] \nFunctional renal imaging, most commonly with MAG3 nuclear medicine renal scan, is recommended in evaluation of children with urinary tract dilation (UTD) suspicious for obstructive uropathy. Alternatively, renal function can be evaluated via functional magnetic resonance urography (fMRU), which provides superior anatomic detail. However, data comparing equivalency of these methods are sparse. Authors of a retrospective review found that differential renal function determined by MAG3 and fMRU in children was not statistically different and concluded that these methods are similar and potentially equivalent. However, MAG3 does not clearly differentiate the dilated collecting system from functional parenchymal tissue, although fMRU does.\n [9] \n\n\n\n\nBenefits of focused emergency renal sonography (FERS) include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases time to diagnosis of obstructive uropathy\n\n\n\n\nFacilitates accurate diagnosis of obstructive uropathy\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nEnhances assessment of the degree of obstruction in renal colic\n\n\n\n\nHelps rule out other, more dangerous, pathology (eg, symptomatic aortic aneurysm)\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nAids identification of obstructive causes of renal insufficiency\n\n\n\n\nIs safe for pregnant patients and children and requires less radiation than either intravenous pyelography (IVP) or helical computed tomography (CT)\n [12, 13, 14, 15] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance of FERS should not delay initiation of emergent treatments such as use of intravenous fluids or pressors, when indicated. Although the need for ongoing resuscitation and a state of extremis are not contraindications, FERS can be difficult to perform in such situations.\n\nPatients should be evaluated in the supine position but can be moved to posterior oblique and lateral decubitus positions for improved visualization. The entire abdomen of male patients should be exposed for the examination. Special care should be taken to minimize exposure of sensitive areas in female patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Octreotide Scintigraphy": "\nBackground\n\n\nOctreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, a cyclic neuropeptide normally found in neuronal and endocrine cells (ie, brain, peripheral nerves, and pancreatic endocrine cells). Octreotide scan is also known as somatostatin receptor (SSTR) scintigraphy. This scintigraphy is useful in detection of carcinoid tumors and various neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Neuroendocrine cells appear in many areas, including the brain, thyroid, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. For detection of pancreatic NETs, octreotide scanning has a sensitivity of 75 to 100%.\n [1] \nThe plasma half-life of natural somatostatin is 1-3 minutes. Indium-111 (111In)–labeled pentetreotide specifically binds to SSTRs (especially to subtypes 2 and 5), which are G-protein coupled receptors.\n [2]  SSTRs are maximally expressed on well-differentiated NETs. SSTR-2 shows maximum expression, followed by SSTR-1, -5, -3, and -4. This type of scan is performed most commonly and provides a planar whole-body image, which in modern medicine fuses with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT). Octreotide scan specificity and anatomic details of SPECT/CT are thereby combined.\n [1] \n\n\nAbdellatif formulated a novel model to easily identify SSTR-2 and other receptors, which serves as a promising platform for identification of tumor cells overexpressing SSTR-2, offering a hopeful target for cancer therapy and tumor scintigraphy.\n [3] \nThe second and newest SSTR-based imaging method uses positron emitter gallium (Ga) to mark somatostatin analogs, including Ga-DOTATOC (DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide), Ga-DOTANOC (1-Nal3-octreotide), and Ga-DOTATATE (DOTA-[Tyr]-octreotate), whose uptake is measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Gamma cameras work to detect the radioactive octreotide tracer, which reveals the locations of tumor cells. Octreotide scans have been shown to localize 86% of carcinoids, 89% of neuroblastomas, 86% of pheochromocytomas, 94% of paragangliomas, and 80% of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs). Their utility in detecting medullary thyroid carcinomas and pituitary tumors is comparatively less.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nOther somatostatin analogs (eg, technetium-99m depreotide [99mTc depreotide]; DTPA) are used in imaging pituitary tumors. The presence of SSTRs in numerous pituitary and parasellar tumors allows visualization with radionucleotide-labeled somatostatin analogs in vivo. In the pituitary gland, prolactin- and adrenocorticotropic hormone–secreting adenomas cannot be localized, but clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas are visualized in 75% of cases with 111In-DTPA-octreotide.\n [4, 5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nA positive scan result in patients with growth hormone– and thyroid-stimulating hormone–secreting pituitary tumors indicates a good suppressive effect of octreotide on hormone release by these tumors.\n [4] Octreotide is used for scintigraphic localization of primary and metastatic NETs that bear SSTRs.\n [2] Somatostatin receptors have been found in many neuroendocrine and several nonneuroendocrine cells. Capitalizing on this concept of SSTR positivity, SSTR scintigraphy has been developed to image tumors that arise from these cells.\n [7, 8] Further study of diagnostic approaches that address these biological characteristics of various tumors could open a whole new therapeutic vista.\n [9] \n\nTumors with high expression of SSTRs that normally are detected with SSTR scintigraphy include the following\n [10] :\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrenal medullary tumors (pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, paraganglioma)\n\n\n\n\nGastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (formerly classified into carcinoid, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide–secreting tumor, pancreatic polypeptide–secreting tumor, etc., or nonfunctioning gastroenteropancreatic tumor), more recently classified by the World Health Organization as low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade (G1, G2, G3, respectively)\n\n\n\n\nMerkel cell tumor of the skin\n\n\n\n\nPituitary adenoma\n\n\n\n\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma\n\n\n\nIndications\nCommon indications for octreotide scintigraphy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection and localization of various suspected neuroendocrine and some nonneuroendocrine tumors and their metastases (vide supra)\n\n\n\n\nStaging of NETs\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up of patients with known disease to evaluate potential recurrence\n\n\n\n\nDetermination of SSTR status (patients with SSTR-positive tumors may be more likely to respond to octreotide therapy)\n\n\n\n\nSelection of patients with metastatic tumors for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and prediction of the effect of PRRT, when available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Ocular Injury Evaluation With Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nEvery year, approximately 1 million patients present to emergency departments (ED) in the United States with ocular injuries.\n [1] These presentations range from obvious penetrating trauma to more subtle acute vision changes without a readily discernible source. Unfortunately, in many centers, ophthalmologic consultation is not available in-house, and computed tomography (CT) scanners are notoriously busy, which delays the time to diagnosis and treatment.\nAlthough not a typical imaging modality used by acute care clinicians for ocular complaints, bedside ultrasonography is increasingly available and can rapidly detect certain types of ocular pathology.\n [2, 3] \n\n\nOcular bedside ultrasound can help diagnose retinal and vitreous hemorrhage, retinal and vitreous detachments, ocular infections, foreign bodies, retrobulbar hematoma, and ocular vascular pathology. In addition, it can measure optic nerve sheath diameter to assess increased intracranial pressure.\n [4, 5, 6] \nIn comparison to formal CT or ophthalmology consultation, bedside ultrasonography has proven to be highly accurate and readily able to identify findings that need referral and additional workup.\n [7, 8]  Studies have reported ultrasound specifity ranging from 82.35 to 99.7% and sensitivity above 42.55 to 97.8% depending on diagnosis.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nCase reports have described the effective use of emergent ocular ultrasonography in extreme settings such as combat hospitals\n [11] and even during space missions.\n [12] \n\n\n\n\nIn patients with suspected globe rupture, the amount of pressure exerted on the eye must be limited to prevent any further damage.\n\nIf the globe appears ruptured on external inspection, the risk of further pressure from a bedside ocular ultrasonographic examination may outweigh the potential benefits. Use caution and give careful clinical consideration before proceeding.\n\nThe following conditions may be further evaluated with bedside ultrasonography:\n\n\n\n\n\nAcute changes in vision\n\n\n\n\nSpontaneous intraocular hemorrhage\n\n\n\n\nLens dislocation\n\n\n\n\nRetinal artery or vein occlusion\n\n\n\n\nRetinal detachment\n\n\n\n\nSuspected elevated intracranial pressures (ICP)\n\n\n\nClosed eyelid examination allows for increased patient comfort and is necessary for patients with significant ocular swelling. Examination through a closed eyelid, however, results in a small and often inconsequential loss of image resolution. In certain situations, an open eye examination is more helpful, if the patient can tolerate it.\n\nThe placement of a sonolucent adhesive such as Tegaderm over the closed eye decreases the risk of conjunctival infection. It also increases the patient’s comfort by avoiding direct contact of the gel with the eyelid surface.\n\nApplying liberal amounts of gel to the eyelids allows the examiner to minimize the amount of pressure exerted on the eye. This results in increased patient compliance and a better examination.\n\nIf too much pressure is exerted, the cornea may begin to flatten out. The goal is to use minimal pressure and to maintain normal corneal convexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pelvic Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nPelvic ultrasonography is one of the best imaging modalities used to evaluate nonspecific pelvic pain, pregnancy complications, anatomy of pelvic organs, and various ovarian pathologies.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  Ultrasound is the key modality for evaluation of contents of the female pelvis. It allows ready (and portable) imaging of the uterus, ovaries, and other structures at a reasonable cost and without ionizing radiation. Lack of irradiation is important because the ovary in young patients and in those of reproductive age is particularly sensitive to radiation.\n [6] \nPelvic ultrasonography is performed via a transabdominal (TA) or transvaginal (TV) approach. A urine-filled bladder helps lift the small bowel superiorly out of the pelvis, creating an optimal acoustic window and preventing bowel air from refracting or degrading the ultrasound beam. Ultrasound traverses the pelvis unimpeded through bladder fluid, insonating pelvic contents and returning to the transducer to be processed by the machine.\n [6] \n\n\nIn transabdominal ultrasonography, a low-frequency transducer and a full bladder are used to displace bowel gas and provide an acoustic window to improve image resolution while allowing a large viewing field of the pelvis. The transvaginal approach, also known as endovaginal scanning, is a painless procedure that resembles a pelvic exam. A thin, covered wand or probe is placed into the vagina, and the examiner directs the probe toward the uterus and ovaries. This type of ultrasound produces a better image than is attained by a scan through the abdominal wall because the probe can be positioned closer to the ovaries. This is the best test for diagnosing an ovarian cyst.\nEndovaginal scanning, using a high-frequency transducer, is the preferred technique for evaluation of ovarian pathologies; a full bladder is not necessary.\n [2]  Endovaginal scanning is preferred over computed tomography because of improved visualization of pelvic organs, the absence of radiation exposure with ultrasonography, decreased length of hospital stay, and reduced cost for the patient.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nAccording to practice parameters of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), indications for pelvic ultrasonography of the female pelvis include, but are not limited to, the following\n [7] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Evaluation of pelvic pain; pelvic masses; endocrine abnormalities, including polycystic ovaries; dysmenorrhea (painful menses); amenorrhea; abnormal uterine bleeding; postmenopausal bleeding; delayed menses; signs or symptoms of pelvic infection; congenital uterine, gonadal, and lower genital tract anomalies; excessive bleeding, pain, or signs of infection after pelvic surgery, delivery, or abortion; and incontinence of pelvic organ prolapse.\n         \n\n\n\n          Follow-up of a previously detected abnormality.\n         \n\n\n\n          Evaluation, monitoring, and/or treatment of patients with infertility.\n         \n\n\n\n          Evaluation when clinical examination of the pelvis is limited.\n         \n\n\n\n          Further characterization of a pelvic abnormality noted on another imaging study.\n         \n\n\n\n          Localization of an intrauterine device (IUD).\n         \n\n\n\n          Screening for malignancy in high-risk patients.\n         \n\n\n\n          Guidance for interventional or surgical procedures.\n         \n\n\n\n          Preoperative and postoperative evaluation of pelvic structures.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n​Use of ultrasound for the male pelvis is limited. The presence of free abdominal fluid can be assessed. Undescended testes in the groin and hernias can be seen with the use of high-frequency linear array transducers. Transabdominal ultrasound can allow visualization of the dilated urethra in posterior urethral valves. and,occasionally a valve itself can be seen in real time. Inferiorly angled midline views are most helpful. Transperineal ultrasonography can be utilized for diagnosis of posterior urethral valves.\n [6] \n\n(The video below depicts a demonstration of transvaginal ultrasonography.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstration of a transvaginal ultrasonographic pelvic evaluation.

        "Pulmonary Angiography Technique": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe pulmonary vasculature may be evaluated with various invasive and noninvasive methods. Historically, catheter-directed pulmonary angiography has been used most commonly for the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Over the past two decades, however, catheter angiography has become almost entirely supplanted by CT angiography (CTA), which is now the accepted standard of care for diagnosis of suspected PE, in part owing to its superior sensitivity and specificity.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Other noninvasive methods, such as MRI/A and V/Q scans, are also used to evaluate the anatomy and hemodynamics of the pulmonary vasculature.\n [8] \nMultislice computed tomography (MSCTA) has been shown to have a sensitivity of 82-97% and a specificity of 78-96% in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.\n [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]  Multidector CT (MDCT) technology has the potential to further enhance the ability of CTPA to determine the presence and clinical significance of pulmonary thromboembolism.\n [15] \n\n\nCurrently, the main clinical utility of conventional pulmonary angiography is for therapeutic intervention and, in selected cases, preoperative evaluation of the pulmonary arteries.\nSelected examples of abnormalities identified with pulmonary angiography are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelective left pulmonary angiogram shows abrupt tapering of the segmental pulmonary arteries (arrow) with heterogeneous opacification of the parenchyma.

        "Testicular Evaluation Using Bedside Ultrasonography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nTesticular ultrasonography (also called scrotal ultrasonography) is the primary diagnostic modality for evaluation of testicular and scrotal disease.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] Its nonionizing nature, along with continued advances in technology, render ultrasonography the imaging modality of choice. Testicular ultrasonography is a useful noninvasive tool for both adult and pediatric patient groups. It serves as a good screening and diagnostic tool and helps dictate further management in the appropriate clinical setting.\n [5] Testicular ultrasonography has a wide range of applications, ranging from acute scrotal pain to more chronic and nonspecific symptoms. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency and occurs primarily in males aged 10-19 years, with a prevalence of 1 in 4000.\n [6, 5, 7] \nScrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, including testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions such as hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within 6 hours of presentation, when the salvage rate is about 90%.\n [8]  In the clinical setting of testicular torsion, ultrasonography should not delay manual or surgical reduction. Testicular salvage rates drop dramatically after 6 hours, to about 60% at 13 hours and 50% by 24 hours.\n [6, 9] \n\n\nEpididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass that is discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate all suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.\n [8] \nTypically, scrotal ultrasonography and testicular ultrasonography are not associated with any complications. The patient may experience pain if the testis is acutely inflamed or torqued, particularly in the setting of trauma. Sonography with a high-frequency transducer is the modality of choice for imaging the scrotum. Most intratesticular lesions are hypoechoic. Differentiation of intratesticular hypoechoic lesions such as testicular cysts, tumors, and inflammatory lesions, as well as segmental testicular infarction and testicular trauma, as either malignant or benign is important so that appropriate treatment can be provided.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nGuidelines on scrotal ultrasound examination have been published by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (in collaboration with the American College of Radiology, the Society for Pediatric Radiology, and the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound).\n [11]  Indications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of scrotal pain, including but not limited to testicular trauma, ischemia/torsion, and infectious or inflammatory scrotal disease\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of palpable inguinal, intrascrotal, or testicular masses\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of scrotal asymmetry, swelling, or enlargement\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of potential intrascrotal hernias\n\n\n\n\nDetection/Evaluation of varicoceles\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of male infertility\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up of prior indeterminate scrotal ultrasound findings\n\n\n\n\nLocalization of nonpalpable testes\n\n\n\n\nDetection of occult primary tumors in patients with metastatic germ cell tumors or unexplained retroperitoneal adenopathy\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up of patients with prior primary testicular neoplasms, leukemia, or lymphoma\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of abnormalities noted on other imaging studies (including but not limited to computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and positron emission tomography [PET])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography offers an improved way to depict anatomy while assessing for abnormalities.

        "Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) in Radiology": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nA transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a percutaneously created connection within the liver between portal and systemic circulations. A TIPS is placed to reduce portal pressure in patients with complications related to portal hypertension.\n [1, 2] This procedure has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgery in patients with end-stage liver disease.\n [3]  TIPS is now regarded as a well-established percutaneous means of decreasing portal hypertension. Major clinical indications for TIPS include refractory variceal hemorrhage and refractory ascites. The shunt itself is created by placing a stent between the portal vein and the hepatic vein.\n [4] \nIn patients with liver cirrhosis, esophageal varices is present in 85% and the rupture rate is 10-15%. Variceal hemorrhage is associated with a 40% mortality and a 70% recurrence rate. In patients with acute variceal bleeding, endoscopy is recommended within 12 hours of admission by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European Association for the Study of the Liver. TIPS creation may be considered in patients with bleeding that cannot be controlled endoscopically and in those at high risk for rebleeding.\n [5, 6, 7] \n\n\n(See the images below.)\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. A curved catheter is placed into the right hepatic vein. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Image demonstrates advancement of a Colapinto needle into the right portal vein. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of TIPS placement is to divert portal blood flow into the hepatic vein, so as to reduce the pressure gradient between portal and systemic circulations. Shunt patency is maintained by placing an expandable metal stent across the intrahepatic tract.\n\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt implantation is an effective and safe treatment for portal hypertension in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), according to one study. Portal hypertension and HCC are major complications of advanced liver cirrhosis. Forty HCC patients with portal hypertension who were treated with TIPS were included in the analysis. No severe procedure-related complications and no deterioration of liver function were observed.\n [3] \n\nAlthough TIPS is relatively safe, procedural or shunt-related morbidity can reach 20%, and procedural complications have a fatality rate of 2%. Delayed recognition and treatment of TIPS complications can lead to life-threatening clinical scenarios. Complications vary from stent migration or malpositioning to nontarget organ injury, TIPS dysfunction, encephalopathy, or liver failure.\n [8] \n\nSeveral pediatric diseases such as extrahepatic portal vein obstruction, biliary atresia, alpha1-antitrypsin deficit, and autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and portal hypertension in children. Interventional radiology procedures can facilitate diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension in the pediatric population. These procedures include image-guided liver biopsy, mesenteric-intrahepatic left portal vein shunts, balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, and splenic embolization.\n [9] \n\nIn a study of patients from the National Inpatient Sample (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project) who underwent TIPS, Helzberg et al found that Black patients had significantly higher in-hospital mortality and longer lengths of stay. Non-Hispanic Black patients had a 20% mortality rate, about twice the rate of all other racial/ethnic groups, which ranged from 9 to 10.8%. Black patients were significantly more likely to undergo delayed endoscopy, and non-white patients generally had longer wait times from admission to TIPS.\n [10] \n\nALTA recommendations\nThe Advancing Liver Therapeutic Approaches (ALTA) Consortium, which focuses on management of portal hypertension, have published recommendations on TIPS, including the following\n [11] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Prior to TIPS creation, recommend that a gastroenterologist or hepatologist should be involved in the initial decision to place an emergent or nonemergent TIPS, with subsequent consultation by an interventional radiologist or other proceduralist with competency in TIPS. If center expertise is not available, we recommend referral to an expert center.\n         \n\n\n\n          Recommend contrast-enhanced multiphasic cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) to assist with TIPS planning.\n         \n\n\n\n          Recommend domprehensive echocardiography to assess for abnormalities in cardiac structure, function, and right ventricular systolic pressure.\n         \n\n\n\n          In patients with cirrhosis undergoing emergent TIPS, suggest at least a liver ultrasound with Doppler to evaluate the patency of the portal venous system and consideration of a limited (bedside) echocardiogram, evaluating left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular systolic pressure.\n         \n\n\n\n          The absolute contraindications to elective TIPS include severe congestive heart failure, severe untreated valvular heart disease, moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension (based on invasive measurements) despite medical optimization, uncontrolled systemic infection, refractory overt HE, unrelieved biliary obstruction, and lesions (eg, cysts) or tumors in the liver parenchyma that preclude TIPS creation.\n         \n\n\n\n          For patients undergoing TIPS placement, recommend the use of an ePTFE lined stent graft with controlled expansion, which allows the operator to tailor the amount of portosystemic shunting based on the indication, target gradient, and patient comorbidities.\n         \n\n\n\n          The use of general anesthesia, deep sedation, or conscious sedation may all be appropriate for TIPS placement, and their use will vary depending on the patient risk factors and local practices.\n         \n\n\n\n          Recommend the use of the free hepatic vein or IVC pressure as the systemic pressure when measuring the portosystemic gradient before and after TIPS placement.\n         \n\n\n\n          In patients undergoing TIPS placement who are potentially eligible for liver transplant, recommend positioning the stent as to not interfere with the portal and hepatic vein anastomoses, presuming that this does not detrimentally affect TIPS function or patency. This positioning includes leaving a segment of unstented main portal vein and not extending the TIPS stent into the right atrium.\n         \n\n\n\n          In all patients undergoing TIPS creation, routine labs (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and PT/INR) should be obtained on the day following TIPS creation. Hemoglobin/hematocrit labs may be obtained on the same day of TIPS creation, depending on institution and/or operator discretion.\n         \n\n\n\n          In patients who have undergone TIPS creation for management of varices, either Doppler ultrasound findings suggesting TIPS dysfunction, or persistence or recurrence of portal hypertensive complications, should prompt TIPS venography and manometry +/− intervention. Ultrasound findings suggesting TIPS dysfunction include alterations in intrahepatic portal vein direction of flow, abnormal flow velocities within the TIPS, and persistent (eg, >6 wk post-TIPS) or recurrent ascites.\n         \n\n\n\n          In patients who have undergone TIPS creation for management of ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax, persistence or recurrence of portal hypertensive complications should prompt TIPS venography and manometry +/− intervention. Medical decision-making should be individualized in patients with well-controlled ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax and ultrasound findings suggesting TIPS dysfunction.\n         \n\n\n\n          Recommend counseling patients that TIPS is associated with a risk of overt HE in approximately 25–50% of recipients. Patient-specific risk factors for development of post-TIPS overt HE include prior history of overt HE, advanced age, advanced liver dysfunction, hyponatremia, renal dysfunction, and sarcopenia.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Transrectal Ultrasonography of the Prostate": "\nBackground\n\n\nProstate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer in males in the United States. It is estimated that about 60-70% of older men on autopsy have some degree of prostate cancer, compared with 15-20% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime and with the 3% lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer.\n [1, 2, 3]  An estimated one in six white men and one in five African-American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, with the likelihood increasing with age. Prostate cancer is rarely diagnosed in men younger than 40 years, and it is uncommon in men younger than 50 years.\n [4] \nManagement of prostate cancer can include active surveillance, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or surgery. In active surveillance, patients are followed by their urologist by means of periodic physical exams, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, digital rectal exam (DRE), and/or periodic repeat prostate biopsies. The decision regarding whether one can pursue active surveillance depends on the biopsy results, PSA levels, and the clinical stage of the cancer. The American Urological Association (AUA) deems active surveillance an option in prostate cancer patients who have a low PSA level, clinical stage, and Gleason score, making accurate biopsy results extremely important in considering patients for this option.\n [2] \n\n\nA useful tool that can help supplement various diagnostic and treatment modalities for prostate cancer is transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). TRUS has become an extension of the urologist’s finger in the early detection of prostate cancer. The evolution of end-firing probes has further enhanced urologists’ ability to monitor the entire process of a prostate biopsy.\n [3] TRUS is also widely used to deliver treatments such as brachytherapy and to monitor cryotherapy treatment for prostate cancer.\nThe use of sound waves to detect distant objects on the basis of their reflective properties became popular after World War II. In medicine, the initial use of ultrasound was in the detection of brain tumors. In urology, ultrasound was first used to detect renal stones during surgery.\n\n\n\n\nThe early applications of ultrasonography in medicine involved sound-wave generators, cathode-ray tubes, Polaroid photography, or 35-mm film recording. However, the invention of the silicone microchip gave birth to the modern ultrasonography revolution.\n\n\n\n\nEarly investigators in prostatic ultrasonography conducted experiments with ultrasound probes and recording devices. One of the earliest devices was a chair-type apparatus with a probe mounted in the center of the chair. The patient sat on the probe, which was guided into the rectum. Improvements in gray-scale ultrasound display and multiplanar scanning have resulted in user-friendly hand-held probes.\n\nEarlier studies concentrated on the ultrasonographic appearances of prostate abnormalities such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), carcinoma of the prostate (CAP), prostatitis, prostatic abscess, and prostatic calculi. Since the introduction of the PSA screening test and early detection of prostate cancer, the role of TRUS has changed; it is mainly used to visualize the prostate (see the image below) and to aid in guided needle biopsy.\n\nReal-time prostate biopsy has emerged as a potential replacement for conventional systematic biopsy in an effort to improve quality, reduce the number of clinically insignificant cancer diagnoses, and improve targeting of high-grade and clinically significant tumors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxial image of a prostate. White arrows show the asymmetrical anterior prostate. This could only be appreciated on TRUS images. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPSA guidelines\nThe American Urological Association (AUA) has published updated guidelines for the early detection of prostate cancer (CAP) to guide urologists in the screening of asymptomatic men.\n [5] The panel recommended against screening men younger than 40 years and the routine screening of men aged 40 to 54 years who are at average risk for CAP. Men younger than 55 years who are at increased risk for CAP (family history or African American race) should discuss an individualized approach to prostate cancer screening with their urologists. Men aged 55 to 69 years appear to derive the greatest benefit from screening. For men in this age group, the panel strongly recommended shared decision-making regarding PSA screening and proceeding at 2-year intervals depending on the individual’s values and preferences. PSA screening is not recommended for men older than 70 years or for any man with less than 10-15 years of life expectancy.\n [5] \n\nFuture applications\nPossible future applications involving TRUS include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nColor Doppler scanning\n\n\n\n\nContrast-enhanced prostate biopsy\n\n\n\n\nIntermittent and harmonic ultrasonography\n\n\n\n\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\n\n\n\n\nElastography\n\n\n\n\nMRI ultrasound coregistration\n\n\n\nColor Doppler\nColor Doppler scanning has been used to enhance the diagnosis of CAP as an adjunct to TRUS. Several investigators have demonstrated that the addition of color Doppler improved the specificity of prostate biopsy findings. However, differentiating a focus of prostatitis from cancer was difficult. The addition of power Doppler was not advantageous.\n\nContrast-enhanced prostate biopsy\nThe use of microbubble contrast agents can enhance gray-scale imaging and Doppler imaging. Newer agents that remain in the vascular compartment have been used for prostate imaging. Currently available agents include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPerflenapent emulsion (EchoGen)\n\n\n\n\nGalactose–palmitic acid (Levovist)\n\n\n\n\nPerflexane lipid microspheres (Imavist)\n\n\n\n\nGalactose suspension (Echovist)\n\n\n\n\nPerflutren lipid microsphere (DMP 115, Definity)\n\n\n\n\nPerfluorobutane microspheres (NC100-100, Sonazoid)\n\n\n\nSeveral investigators have evaluated contrast-enhanced prostate ultrasonography. Ragde et al used EchoGen to study 15 patients with rising PSA levels and previous negative biopsy findings and found that the addition of this contrast agent helped guide biopsies to appropriate sites.\n [6] \n\nSimilarly, Watanabe et al studied 9 cases in which Levovist was used and demonstrated enhanced images of all cancers.\n [7] Halpern et al evaluated 26 patients with elevated PSA levels and found significant image enhancement after using Imavist.\n [8] However, the extra cost of this technique may be the limiting factor in its widespread use.\n\nIntermittent and harmonic ultrasonography\nThe rationale for intermittent and harmonic ultrasonography is that conventional ultrasonography destroys the microbubbles of the contrast agents used in ultrasonographic imaging. Intermittent ultrasonography increases the enhancement provided by the contrast agents. In harmonic imaging, the reverberations produced by the contrast agent are visualized at a different frequency than the insonating frequency, which can provide a better image.\n\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound\nWith extracorporeal HIFU, temperatures higher than 60°C can be achieved in the target tissue. The prostate can be easily treated with this modality via a transrectal probe. The size of the thermal lesion can be controlled by the power and the duration of the ultrasound pulse. Higher in situ intensities (>3055 W/cm2) create the cavitation phenomenon and bubble effect, which are difficult to monitor.\n\nThe currently available HIFU devices use 3-4 MHz transducers. Experimental studies have shown core temperatures of 75°C, with a peak of 99°C during insonification.\n\nGelet et al pioneered the use of transrectal HIFU in the treatment of prostate cancer.\n [9]  The procedure is used to treat localized prostate cancer and is performed with the patient under anesthesia and in a decubitus position. Rectal cooling is employed to prevent rectal burns. Prostates smaller than 40 mL or those with an anteroposterior diameter of less than 5 cm are best suited for this treatment. During the procedure, the whole gland is treated (in contrast to focal therapy). After the procedure, a suprapubic tube is left in place for 5-7 days. In a multicenter trial of 402 patients treated with HIFU, the median duration for catheter use was 5 days.\n [10] Prolonged retention occurred in 9% of patients, and 3.6% developed urethral strictures. Incontinence following HIFU was rare (0.6%). Rectourethral fistula developed in 1.2% of the patients.\n\nComplication rates are higher with salvage HIFU after radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy, or HIFU. Erectile function can be preserved in 20-46% of patients who undergo only 1 session of HIFU.\n\nAfter a minimum follow-up period of 6 months, Thuroff et al reported negative biopsy results in 87% of patients and a median nadir PSA level of 0.4 ng/mL after HIFU.\n [10] Gelet at al reported that 78% of low-risk patients were disease-free and had negative biopsy results at an actuarial 5-year follow-up.\n [9] \n\nGelet et al also reported salvage HIFU after failed radiation in 71 patients.\n [11] Among these patients, biopsy results were negative in 80%, and 61% had a PSA level nadir below 0.5 ng/mL. Complication rates after salvage HIFU were higher: total incontinence developed in 6%, rectourethral fistula in 6%, and vesical neck contracture in 17%.\n\nProstate elastography\nDRE, PSA testing, and color Doppler TRUS-guided systematic biopsy are the basis for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. As alluded to earlier, TRUS has not been proven as a reliable imaging technique for localizing cancer foci within the prostate. Krouskop et al\n [12] theorized that cell density is greater in neoplastic tissue, causing a change in tissue elasticity. This line of thinking formed the basis for elastography, which was developed in the early 1990’s. As elastography developed, it has been increasingly applied for prostate cancer imaging. Konig et al\n [13] studied 404 patients with suspected prostate cancer and found that elastography detected 84% of the 151 true positive cancer patients.\n\nElastrography is an ultrasound tool that is capable of mapping tissue stiffness of the prostate. There are 2 elastography techniques: quasi-static and shear-wave.\n [14] Quasi-static technique involves the analysis of prostate tissue deformation before and after compression by the ultrasound transducer. This difference in deformation is used to estimate the tissue stiffness. Reduced deformation typically indicates neoplastic tissue; additionally, if this tissue appears hypoechoic, it is likely a malignancy. The shear-wave technique requires no compression of the rectal wall and is based on the measurement of shear-wave velocity propagating through the tissues. Elastic properties are typically provided in kilopascals (kPa), where neoplastic nodularity is suspicious at levels greater than 35 kPa.\n [15] \n\nElastography has proved to be a useful tool in the detection of prostate cancer. In Miyanaga’s study,\n [16] of 29 patients with untreated prostate cancer, the sensitivity of elastography, TRUS, and DRE were 93%, 59%, and 55%, respectively. Pallwein et al\n [17] studied 15 patients who were initially studied with standard ultrasound and elastography before undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, and they found that elastography was 88% sensitive for detecting cancer foci and that 78.3% of the cases correlated with the histologic findings. Further analysis showed that the best sensitivity and specificity were found in the apex region.  Additionally, elastography has been shown to have a negative predictive value of up to 99% for the detection of prostate cancer, making it unlikely that cancers will be missed with this technique.\n [15] \n\nIn terms of targeted prostate biopsy, a larger study, by Pallwein et al,\n [18] concluded that elastography was 2.9 times more likely to detect prostate cancer than systematic TRUS biopsy. Furthermore, elastography required fewer than half the number of biopsy cores. When evaluating elastography for the staging of prostate cancer, Salomon et al\n [19] evaluated 15 patients who underwent elastography after radical prostatectomy and found that 14 of 15 patients were correctly identified for the presence or absence of extracapsular disease.\n\nElastography certainly has shown promise as an alternative to conventional TRUS, and further clinical trials are being conducted, which will likely lead to better understanding of the exact role for elastography in the management of prostate cancer.\n\nMRI ultrasound coregistration\nProstate MRI was first reported over 30 years ago.\n [20] MRI \"in bore\" biopsy, where targeting biopsies are performed within the MRI gantry, has been the most widely examined prostate biopsy procedure; however, because of increased cost, lack of availability, and overall clinical outcomes, it is unlikely to replace systematic biopsy. MRI coregistration with ultrasound, commonly referred to as MR-US fusion, has been an area of increasing research and is a potential replacement for systematic biopsy moving forward.\n\nMR-US fusion allows MRI data to be used to obtain biopsies under ultrasound guidance. Cognitive fusion refers to the operator viewing lesions on MRI, allowing one to attempt biopsy of the visualized location from memory using real-time US. Obvious disadvantages include potential for human error and the steep learning curve and variability of results. In an effort to reduce this variability, several fusion devices have been developed and are now approved by the FDA.\n [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] \n\nThe Artemis device (Eigen) utilizes tracking of the TRUS probe by a directly attached robotic arm that translates the 2D US into a 3D model, which is fused with the preprocedure MRI and allows targeting of suspicious lesions.\n [20] The device also tracks biopsy sites, allowing rebiopsy of the exact site at a later time.\n\nSonn et al\n [21] found that in men undergoing active surveillance with previously negative biopsy results, the Artemis device detected cancer in 55% of men overall and 94% of those with the highest level of suspicion on MRI. They also found that there was a clinically significant increase in the detection of significant cancers and a decreased detection of insignificant cancers, as compared to systematic biopsy.\n\nDisadvantages of using the Artemis device include the bulkiness of the device and difficulty with in-office use. The UroNav device (Invivo) utilizes a sensor that attaches to the TRUS probe, and using a small electromagnetic field placed in close proximity to the patient, it fuses the MRI data.\n [20] It is a free-hand technique that is generally more familiar to urologists. However, it has the disadvantage of an electromagnetic field, as opposed to the accuracy of the robot.\n\nVourganti et al\n [22] found that in patients with previous negative biopsy results, UroNav detected cancer in 37% of patients, including 11% with high-grade disease. The Urostation device (Koelis) utilizes real-time 3D TRUS in a recreated model of the prostate to localize each biopsy site.\n [20] The model is reset with each probe firing to adjust for any changes. This device has the advantage of a free-hand platform, though the inherent error in any free-hand technique still exists.\n\nDelongchamps et al\n [27] compared cognitive and fusion MR-US devices with systematic biopsy. In their study of 391 patients, they found no difference in the rate of cancer detection for visually targeted versus random biopsy. The fusion MR-US devices did increase the detection of high-grade cancer with fewer cores, while decreasing the rate of micro focal cancer detection.\n\nPuech et al\n [23] studied men with a suspicious lesion on MRI, and each man underwent 12 random core biopsies, 2 visually guided biopsies, and 2 MR-US fusion software-targeted biopsies. The study found that targeted biopsy detected clinically significant cancer in more men than random biopsy; however, there was no significant difference in cancer detection between cognitive fusion and MR-US fusion software.\n\nMR-US coregistration has shown promise as a targeted method of sampling the prostate leading to more accurate identification of clinically significant prostate cancer. However, it remains unclear whether the biopsy results can be applied to the conventional risk-stratification systems that were designed for systematic and random biopsy. It is also unclear how exactly this will impact the practicing urologist. Long-term studies are certainly required. Nonetheless, it is an important advancement in the ongoing effort to improve the management of prostate cancer.\n\nThe AUA and Society of Abdominal Radiology (SAR) has issued a consensus statement on the role of MRI in prostate biopsies.\n [28] The joint commission recognizes that the use of prostate MRI followed by MRI-targeted core biopsy is more useful in detecting clinically significant disease over standardized repeat biopsy. As a result, the organizations recommend that physicians strongly consider prostate MRI in patients with a prior negative biopsy who are undergoing repeat biopsy for clinically suspicious cancer. The authors state that the MRI should be reported in accordance with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 (V2) guidelines. In these guidelines, each lesion is assessed a number (1-5) on the basis of the likelihood of the lesion correlating with the presence of cancer (see Table 1).\n [29]   The committee recommends image-targeted biopsy for any lesions with a PI-RADS category of 3 to 5.\n\nThe recommendations also note that although TRUS-MRI fusion and in-bore MRI targeting biopsies may be useful for smaller lesions, cognitive fusion will suffice if this equipment is not readily available. During the procedure, it is recommended that at least 2 targeted cores be taken from each suspected lesion, although this number could vary on the basis of the specific case and the physician’s clinical judgment.  Furthermore, in patients with negative or lower-suspicion MRI findings, ancillary tests (eg, PSA, PSAD) may be helpful in determining which patients warrant rebiopsy.\n\nTwo important trials that assessed the use of MP-MRI in the detection of CAP include the PROMIS\n [24]  and PRECISION trials. Both trials were large, multicenter studies. The PROMIS trial compared the use of MP-MRI or TRUS-guided biopsy with template prostate mapping biopsy (TPM-biopsy) in the detection of clinically significant CAP (Gleason score 3+4=7 or greater) and demonstrated that MP-MRI was more sensitive and had a higher NPV (93% and 89%, respectively) than TRUS-guided biopsy, but MP-MRI had a lower specificity and PPV (41% and 51%, respectively). The PROMIS trial did not assess the use of MRI-ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy.\n\nThe PRECISION\n [30]  trial was a non-inferiority trial that appraised the clinical value of using MP-MRI in both the screening and, if radiologically positive, the guided biopsy and subsequent diagnosis of CAP, as compared to TRUS-guided biopsy. The results demonstrated that MP-MRI was associated with an increase in the detection of clinically significant CAP (absolute adjusted increase of 12%, P=.005), a reduction in the detection of clinically insignificant CAP (absolute adjusted decrease of 13%, P=0.053), and a reduction in the number of patients who underwent biopsy (28% of randomized men did not undergo biopsy because of a negative MP-MRI result, compared to 0 men who did not undergo biopsy in the TRUS-guided group). The study also demonstrated that MP-MRI was associated with fewer required core biopsies (median of 4 cores in the MP-MRI arm, compared to 12 in the standard TRUS-guided arm) and a reduced complication rate at 30 days. Of note is that this trial was quite practical in its inclusion/exclusion criteria and protocols; thus, its results can likely be reasonably generalized to common urological practice.\n\n\n\nTable.

        "Ultrasonography-Assisted Central Line Placement (Central Venous Access)": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nCentral venous (CV) access is a commonly performed procedure with multiple indications in routine and emergent situations. Access to the internal jugular vein (IJV),\n [1]  the subclavian vein (SV),\n [2] and the femoral vein (FV) using the traditional landmark-based approach has typically been described in emergency medicine and critical care literature. Central venous access devices are routinely used in clinical practice for administering fluids and medications, for drawing blood samples, and for providing hemodynamic monitoring. The adoption of ultrasound-guided venipuncture has significantly reduced procedure-related complications. Bedside ultrasound has come to be regarded as a promising tool for ensuring an accurate and intraprocedural method of tip navigation and tip location.\n [3, 4] \nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) has published guidelines on central venous access, including the following\n [5] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Use real-time ultrasound guidance for vessel localization and venipuncture when the internal jugular vein is selected for cannulation. When feasible, real-time ultrasound may be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected.\n         \n\n\n\n          Use static ultrasound imaging before prepping and draping for prepuncture identification of anatomy to determine vessel localization and patency when the internal jugular vein is selected for cannulation. Static ultrasound may also be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected.\n         \n\n\n\nOver 5 million central lines are placed in the United States each year. In the past, anatomic landmarks have been used  for placement of central lines, and in some instances this approach is still used. However, this method may make accessing the target vessel difficult in patients with anomalous anatomy or in obese patients, often decreasing the chance for successful placement and increasing the risk of complications. The use of ultrasound during central venous access has been shown to decrease both complication rates and costs.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nStudies using landmark-based methods have reported failure rates and complication rates as high as 30%\n [7] and 18.8%, respectively. One study looked at femoral venous access during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and found that 31% of catheters were not in the femoral vein.\n [8] \nUse of ultrasonography for CV access was first described in 1978\n [9] ; Doppler localization was used to mark the skin overlying the IJV. Not until 1986 was the use of real-time ultrasonographic guidance for IJV cannulation reported.\n [10]  An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence Report listed bedside ultrasonography during CV access as one of 11 practices with \"strength of evidence for supporting more widespread implementation.\"\n [11] In the Emergency Ultrasound Guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), ultrasonographic guidance for CV access was listed as a \"core or primary emergency ultrasound application.\"\n [12]  Ortega et al described the method of employing ultrasonography for locating the IJV, underlining the safety and reliability of this technique.\n [13] These authors also detailed intraoperative use of sterile ultrasonography.\n\n\n\n\nWhen inserting a central venous catheter, one should consider appropriate preparation and asepsis, proper positioning of the patient, and optimal use of ultrasound. Compared with the landmark method of localization, ultrasound can account for anatomic variations, while facilitating visualization of venous puncture and safeguarding against inadvertent arterial puncture.\n [14] \n\nGuidelines and practical advice for ultrasound-guided CV access have been published by the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB). They recommend real-time ultrasound (RTUS) for central venous access as a key safety measure, as well as for use in detecting complications of vascular access and treatment of arterial pseudoaneurysms.\n [15, 16] \n\nThe EFSUMB suggests the following steps for avoiding risks and complications\n [15, 16] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Check the equipment and its function during preparation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Optimize the B-mode picture of the target vessel.\n         \n\n\n\n          Optimize positioning of the patient (eg, Trendelenburg position), of the examiner, and of the US device relative to the puncture site (aim for a comfortable working environment for the interventionalist).\n         \n\n\n\n          Choose the most appropriate head position to locate the target vein lateral rather than anterior to the artery.\n         \n\n\n\n          Complete skills training on appropriate phantoms and on normal patient conditions before participating in emergency situations.\n         \n\n\n\n          For hypovolemic patients, provide intravenous fluid before performing the puncture.\n         \n\n\n\n          Carefully consider the indication for central lines—sometimes peripheral vascular access will meet the needs of the condition.\n         \n\n\nA prospective cohort study by Ullman regarding the rate and causes of central venous access device (CVAD) failure and complications in 163 pediatric patients found that CVAD failure occurred in 20% of devices (incidence rate [IR], 5.72 per 1000 catheter days). CVAD complications were evident in 43% of all CVADs (IR, 12.29 per 1000 catheter days). Causes of failure and complications included inconsistent use of ultrasound guidance for insertion, suboptimal tip-positioning, and device selection.\n [17] \n\nCentral venous access devices are often needed in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The location of the tip of the central catheter is usually assessed by postprocedural x-ray. Guidelines strongly recommend intraprocedural methods of tip location to increase the cost-effectiveness of the maneuver and to shorten the time between device placement and utilization. In this regard, real-time ultrasound represents the most promising tool for tip navigation and location in neonates.\n [18] \n\nUse of ultrasonographic guidance during CV line placement has been shown to significantly decrease the failure rate, the complication rate, and the number of attempts required for successful access.\n [19, 20, 21, 22] A randomized, multicenter trial using point-of-care limited ultrasonography assistance in CV cannulation reported that ultrasonographic guidance resulted in an odds improvement 53.5 (6.6-440) times higher than the landmark-based technique for success of cannulation.\n [23] The average number of attempts and the average time to cannula placement were also significantly lower in the ultrasonographically guided group.\n\nUltrasonographic guidance can facilitate establishment of CV access from multiple sites.\n [24] Ultrasonographic guidance is most useful for cannulation of the IJV and the FV.\n [25, 26] Beaudoin et al found anatomic variability of the femoral vasculature where landmark-based FV cannulation is often attempted. They suggested that ultrasound guidance would improve cannulation and reduce complications during the procedure.\n [27] A prospective trial of ultrasound-guided femoral CV access reported a trend toward a decreased rate of complications.\n [28] \n\nAccess to the SV is more difficult because of its deeper location and the presence of the overlying clavicle, which can prevent the transmission of ultrasound waves. However, ultrasonographic guidance at the midpoint of the clavicle, using the long-axis approach, has been described, as has the supraclavicular approach. An observational study by Theodoro et al suggested that using ultrasonographic guidance to cannulate the IJV may result in fewer adverse events than occur with a landmark-guided approach to the SV.\n [29] \n\nAdditionally, infraclavicular axillary vein cannulation, performed a few centimeters lateral but otherwise in a similar fashion to the infraclavicular approach to the SV, can be performed using either long-axis or short-axis ultrasound. An ultrasound phantom-based study of this approach found that the long-axis approach was associated with greater first attempt success and fewer arterial punctures.\n [30] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Ultrasonography-Assisted Peripheral IV (PIV) Catheter Placement": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nUltrasound (US) guidance for the insertion of peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters offers the following advantages over the traditional method of gaining PIV access\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] :\n\n\n\n\n\nAllows cannulation of veins that are neither visible nor palpable.\n\n\n\n\nReduces the need for a central line and its potential complications.\n\n\n\n\nUS-guided PIV cannulation can be performed in 3 simple steps: survey of venous anatomy, preparation, and needle insertion, which are easily performed by a single operator. Lidocaine 1-2% with or without epinephrine may be used at the site of insertion. The patient may be in the sitting or supine position.\nThe traditional method of PIV catheter insertion requires knowledge of vascular anatomy for estimation of the location of the target vessel and requires visualization or palpation of the vessel for accurate puncture.\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional approach carries numerous inherent problems that include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation of vessels can vary considerably because of anatomic variability.\n\n\n\n\nVeins can be distorted as a result of scarring from previous cannulation attempts or sclerosis.\n\n\n\n\nVeins are difficult to palpate in patients who are obese or edematous.\n\n\n\n\nPatients with difficult access are routinely subjected to multiple insertion attempts by different operators and are at increased risk of complications. In addition to increased discomfort, such patients often have their blood draw and laboratory test results delayed.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the traditional approach fails, the alternative means of gaining intravenous access are blind placement of a PIV catheter, generally in the deep brachial vein; placement of an external jugular (EJ) catheter; or insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC). Each of these options has its own disadvantages.\n\n\n\n\nMost practitioners are not skilled in blind brachial vein catheterization. The technique has high rates of failure and complication.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\nThe external jugular vein is not visible in all patients. Patients often cannot tolerate the Trendelenburg positioning used to place EJ catheters.\n\n\n\n\nWhile CVCs provide additional information and are necessary in many situations, they have a higher complication rate than PIV catheters (eg, pneumothorax, deep vein thrombosis). CVCs should be used when clinically indicated or when alternative options have been attempted unsuccessfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have shown that ultrasound-guided PIV catheter placement results in higher overall and first-pass success rates and very low complication rates. Keyes et al concluded that ultrasound-guided brachial and basilic vein cannulation in the emergency department for patients with difficult access is safe and rapid and has a high success rate.\n [9]  Costantino et al compared ultrasound-guided PIV access with the traditional blind technique and found that ultrasound-guided placement was more successful, required less time, reduced the number of needle punctures, and improved patient satisfaction.\n [3]  Several studies have also shown that in addition to emergency physicians and residents, trained emergency nurses and technicians can safely and effectively perform ultrasound-guided PIV catheterization, reducing the number of procedural tasks required by emergency physicians.\n [10, 11] \n\nComplications\nThe complications associated with ultrasound-guided peripheral line placement are usually minor and occur with significantly lower frequency than those associated with traditional blind techniques. Potential complications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nArterial puncture (brachial): Arterial puncture can be avoided by distinguishing vein from artery through compression or use of color flow Doppler and pulsed-wave spectral Doppler. It can be further avoided by not cannulating the deep brachial vein when other options, such as the cephalic or basilic veins, exist.\n\n\n\n\nParesthesia: This complication occurs secondary to injury to the median or median cutaneous nerves.\n [12] \n\n\n\nThe most common infectious complications with PIV insertion are phlebitis and cellulitis. One observational study reported PIV complications occurring in approximately half of all patients, with the most common complications being phlebitis, hematoma formation, and fluid/blood leakage.\n [13] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Urography": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nUrography is a radiologic technique used for evaluation of the genitourinary system—specifically, the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Although it was originally performed using plain radiographic techniques, advanced imaging modalities have been progressively refined such that computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have largely replaced excretory urography (EU) as the optimal way to image the genitourinary system.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nDespite advances in radiologic techniques, there is no particular gold standard for noninvasive imaging evaluation of the urinary collecting system; each modality has its own set of pitfalls that preclude optimal visualization of the entire urinary system. This article outlines indications for urography, discusses advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and presents key points in performing urography using the different modalities.\n\n\nIndications\nExcretory urography\n\n\n\n\nFollowing are accepted indications for excretory urography (EU), as delineated by the American College of Radiology (ACR)\n [7] :\n\n\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the presence or continuing presence of suspected or known ureteral obstruction.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the integrity of urinary tract status post trauma (including iatrogenic interventions), particularly in situations in which cross-sectional imaging is unavailable or inappropriate.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the urinary tract for suspected congenital anomalies, particularly in situations in which cross-sectional imaging is unavailable or inappropriate.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the urinary tract for lesions that may explain hematuria or infection. In particular, EU may be used to evaluate for an underlying parenchymal mass or for a lesion of the urothelial tract in settings in which cross-sectional imaging is unavailable or inappropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcretory urography (EU) historically was the most frequently performed imaging modality for uroradiology. With advances in ultrasonography and development of cross-sectional urography with CT and MRI, EU is now seldom performed. Consequently, there has been a decline in expertise for this technique. However, EU offers multiple advantages such as its dynamic nature, easy availability, and low cost and radiation burden. These render it potentially highly valuable in specific indications such as congenital anomalies, urothelial lesions, and urinary leaks.\n [8] \n\nComputed tomographic urography\n\nComputed tomography (CT) urography is currently the imaging modality of choice for assessment of the whole urinary tract, providing the possibility of detecting and characterizing benign and malignant conditions. In particular, CT urography offers improved visualization of the urinary collecting system through acquisition of delayed scans obtained after excretion of intravenous contrast medium from the kidneys. Remaining scans are of great help for identification, characterization, and staging of urologic tumors.\n [9] \n\nThe indications for CT urography are similar to those for EU. CT urography is most often used for evaluation of the urinary collecting system in the setting of hematuria. Multidetector CT (MDCT) has been shown to be more sensitive than EU in detection of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper tracts, with sensitivity of 95.8% vs 75%.\n [2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] \n\nOther clinical situations in which CT urography may be useful include trauma with suspected ureteral injury, as well as recurrent and/or complex urinary infections to exclude an underlying obstructive etiology or formation of an abscess. CT urography is also used to detect renal stones and may be used in preoperative planning for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).\n [15] CT urography has been used in the postoperative setting to evaluate the urinary collecting system following cystectomy.\n [16] \n\nAnatomic variations in the urogenital tract have generally been diagnosed through intravenous (IV) urography as the modality of choice. CT urography has replaced traditional IV imaging of the genitourinary tract. Hematuria, tumoral mass, obstructive uropathy, and congenital collecting system abnormalities are indications for CT imaging.\n [17] \n\nWith continued confirmation of the accuracy and advantages of MDCT urography, MDCT has essentially replaced conventional EU. More specifically, the advantages offered by MDCT urography include high spatial and contrast resolution, with ability to obtain isotropic volume data in as thin as 0.5-mm acquisitions, which may be reformatted in multiple planes or reconstructed in 3D. Evaluation of enhancement characteristics through measurement of attenuation values allows characterization of renal lesions.\n\nIn a study by Abuhasanein et al to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CT urography to rule out urinary bladder cancer and possibly eliminate the need for cystoscopy, CT urography with corticomedullary phase was found to successfully exclude urinary bladder cancer with high accuracy. In cases of negative findings on CT urography, the authors suggested it might be reasonable to omit cystoscopy. Negative predictive value was 99%, false negative rate was 7%, and false positive rate was 1%. \n [18] \n\nThe French Society of Genitourinary Imaging provided the following guidelines for CT urography\n [19] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Intravenous injection of 20 mg of furosemide before iodinated contrast medium injection was judged mandatory.\n         \n\n\n\n          Improving the quality of excretory phase imaging through oral or intravenous hydration of the patient or through the use of an abdominal compression device was not deemed necessary.\n         \n\n\n\n          The patient should be imaged in the supine position and placed in the prone position only at the radiologist's request.\n         \n\n\n\n          The choice between single-bolus and split-bolus protocols depends on the context, but split-bolus protocols should be favored whenever possible to decrease patient irradiation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Repeated single-slice test acquisitions should not be performed to decide the timing of excretory phase imaging; instead, excretory phase imaging should be performed 7 min after the injection of the contrast medium.\n         \n\n\nMagnetic resonance urography\n\nTo date, magnetic resonance (MR) urography has been used in patients with urinary tract dilation or urinary obstruction who cannot receive iodinated contrast material or for whom imaging using ionizing radiation is undesirable.\n [20] As such, patient populations for which this modality has been most widely used include children and pregnant patients.\n [20] Note that MR urography is relatively insensitive for detection of renal and ureteral calculi when compared with CT scanning.\n [3, 5, 6, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] \n\nAdditionally, MR urography may be indicated in the diagnosis and staging of cancers involving the kidney, bladder, and prostate. This is due, in part, to the fact that MR imaging offers superior soft tissue contrast resolution and better detection of contrast enhancement.\n [25] \n\nCongenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract include a wide range of malformations ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening conditions. MR urography plays a fundamental role in classifying and managing congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract. This technique provides an overview of different clinical pictures through its panoramic views and high anatomic detail. Deep knowledge of the complexities of embryogenesis and of possible phenotypic patterns enables correct interpretation of MR urography images.\n [26] \n\nIn children, MR urography can be used for preoperative anatomic assessment of vascular anatomy; for evaluation of duplicated collecting systems, renal dysplasia, ectopic ureter, retrocaval ureter, and primary megaureter; and for differentiating hydronephrosis from cystic renal disease.\n [4, 20, 27] Furthermore, MR urography can be used to obtain physiologic information about the collecting systems such as renal transit time, differential renal function, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), obviating the need for nuclear scintigraphy and consequently avoiding associated radiation exposure.\n [28, 29] \n\nThe most common indications for MR urography in children are evaluation of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, including hydronephrosis and renal malformations, and identification of ectopic ureters in children with incontinence.\n [30]  MR urography is a preferred method in the diagnostic algorithm for megaureter, providing both anatomic and functional information. Research suggests that MR urography is superior to ultrasonography and scintigraphy in diagnosing urinary tract anomalies with megaureter.\n [31] \n\nIn pregnant patients, MR urography is generally used to distinguish physiologic dilatation of the ureters from an underlying obstructive uropathy.\n [32] \n\nAdvances in MR imaging techniques, including parallel imaging, free-breathing motion compensation techniques, and compressed sensing may dramatically shorten examination times and may improve image quality and patient tolerance.\n [33]  \n\nContraindications\nExcretory urography\n\nThe technique used in performing a complete EU examination is discussed in detail later; however, the basic premise involves obtaining plain radiographic images of the abdomen at various time points after administration of intravenous iodinated contrast material. A compression device is often used for optimal visualization of the collecting system. Thus, contraindications to EU pertain to use of iodinated contrast material and use of the compression paddle. A positive pregnancy test is an additional absolute contraindication to this procedure.\n\nRisk factors pertaining to use of iodinated contrast material include the following\n [34] :\n\n\n\n\n\nAllergy: A history of a prior allergic-like reaction to contrast media is associated with an up to 5-fold increase in the likelihood of experiencing a subsequent reaction.\n          \n [35] In addition, any patient with a predilection to allergic reactions may be predisposed to a reaction after administration of contrast media. Given the increased risk of severe life-threatening anaphylaxis related to administration of contrast media in the setting of a history of atopy, risk vs benefit should be discussed before this procedure is begun. A premedication regimen may be used to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis.\n         \n\n\n\nAsthma: A history of asthma may be indicative of a greater likelihood of developing a contrast reaction.\n          \n [35] \n\n\n\n\nCardiac status: Attention must focus on patients with significant cardiac disease (congestive heart failure, \n          aortic stenosis, severe cardiomyopathy, and/or \n          pulmonary hypertension), as higher volumes and osmolality of contrast material may result in increased risk for a contrast reaction.\n         \n\n\n\nRenal insufficiency: Contrast nephrotoxicity is defined as rapid deterioration in renal function after administration of contrast media, when no other etiology can be determined from the clinical records.\n          \n [28] Major predisposing risk factors include preexisting renal insufficiency (defined as serum creatinine level >1.5 mg/dL) and diabetes.\n          \n [36] Other risk factors include dehydration, cardiovascular disease, use of diuretics, advanced age (>70 yr), hypertension, and hyperuricemia.\n          \n [37]  Performing multiple contrast-enhanced studies within a 24-hour period is thought to increase the risk for contrast-induced nephrotoxicity.\n          \n [38] \n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous: Relative contraindications to the use of high-osmolality iodinated contrast media (HOCM) in patients with \n          pheochromocytoma, \n          sickle cell disease, and \n          multiple myeloma have been reported. Although administration of low-osmolality or iso-osmotic contrast media may be beneficial for patients with pheochromocytoma and sickle cell disease, little evidence suggests that these agents mitigate the risks associated with multiple myeloma.\n          \n [34] \n\n\n\nContraindications to compression include the following\n [39] :\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence of obstruction on the 5-minute image\n\n\n\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm or other abdominal mass\n\n\n\n\nSevere abdominal pain\n\n\n\n\nRecent abdominal surgery\n\n\n\n\nSuspected urinary tract trauma\n\n\n\n\nPresence of a urinary diversion\n\n\n\n\nPresence of a renal transplant\n\n\n\nComputed tomographic urography\n\nSafe use of iodinated contrast material and compression devices pertains to both CT urography and EU. Additionally, some studies have shown that applying abdominal compression did not improve distention or opacification of the ureters compared with giving the patient a saline bolus.\n [40, 41] Furthermore, CT urography should not be performed in a pregnant patient.\n\nAnother precaution involved in both techniques, but perhaps more pertinent with CT urography, involves the relatively high doses of ionizing radiation involved in imaging the genitourinary tract. The mean effective dose for patients undergoing MDCT urography has been reported at 14.8 mSv ± 3.1, which is about 1.5 times the exposure of EU.\n [42] Use of dose modulation with iterative reconstruction techniques is expected to bring further reductions in dose. This issue becomes of special importance in both children and pregnant patients, for whom MR urography may be the preferred imaging modality.\n\nMagnetic resonance urography\n\nOne of the techniques used for MR urography requires use of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Information is available on the risks of gadolinium-based contrast agents.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe anatomy of the bladder (see the image below) forms an extraperitoneal muscular urine reservoir that lies behind the pubic symphysis in the pelvis. A normal bladder functions through complex coordination of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychological functions that allows filling and emptying of bladder contents. The prime influence on continence is seen in synergic relaxation of detrusor muscles and contraction of bladder neck and pelvic floor muscles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross anatomy of the bladder. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n"

        "Anterior Nasal Packing for Epistaxis": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nEpistaxis is a common problem in the emergency department (ED). Generally, it is relatively benign, but it can sometimes produce serious, life-threatening situations. Up to 60% of the population is estimated to have had at least 1 episode of epistaxis at some point in their lives. Of this group, 6% seek medical care to treat epistaxis, with 1.6 in 10,000 requiring hospitalization.\n [1] \n\n\nMost cases of epistaxis occur in children younger than 10 years. Epistaxis is more common in colder seasons and in northern climates because of decreased humidity and the consequent drying of the nasal mucosa.\n [2] Other major etiologies include inhaled medications, mucosal breakdown caused by infiltration by malignancy or granulomatous disease, and nasal trauma.\nNinety percent of epistaxes are anterior, originating from the Kiesselbach plexus (see the image below). Anterior epistaxes exhibit unilateral, steady, nonmassive bleeding. Just 10% of epistaxes are posterior, exhibiting massive bleeding that is initially bilateral.\n\n\n\n\nNasal vascular anatomy\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal vascular anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lateral nasal wall is supplied by the sphenopalatine artery posteroinferiorly and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries superiorly. The nasal septum also derives its blood supply from the sphenopalatine and the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries with the added contribution of the superior labial artery (anteriorly) and the greater palatine artery (posteriorly). The Kiesselbach plexus, or the Little area, represents a region in the anteroinferior third of the nasal septum, where all 3 of the chief blood supplies to the internal nose converge. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy.\n\nA focused history aids the clinician in managing the acutely bleeding patient. This history should include some or all of the following questions:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich side is bleeding?\n\n\n\n\nWhich side was bleeding initially?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the estimated amount of blood loss?\n\n\n\n\nIs it recurrent?\n\n\n\n\nIs it in the pharynx?\n\n\n\n\nHas any trauma recently occurred?\n\n\n\n\nAre symptoms of hypovolemia present?\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the patient's past medical history and current medications (eg, aspirin, warfarin)?\n [3] \n\n\n\nAs with any unstable patient, initial management begins by assessing airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABCs). Next, the source of the bleeding should be identified. The source of most anterior bleeds can be identified using a headlight and adequate suction.\n\nOnce the bleeding point is identified, cauterization—either chemical (silver nitrate) or electrical (hotwire or bipolar cautery)—usually provides definitive treatment.\n [4] If cauterization is unsuccessful, anterior nasal packing is the next step.\n\nNasal packing is the placement of an intranasal device that applies constant local pressure to the nasal septum. Nasal packing works by (1) direct pressure; (2) consequent reduction of mucosal irritation, which decreases bleeding; and (3) clot formation surrounding the foreign body, which enhances pressure.\n\nFor more information, see Epistaxis, Management of Acute Epistaxis, and Posterior Epistaxis Nasal Pack.\n\nIndications\nAnterior nasal packing is indicated for overt or suspected epistaxis after direct pressure, topical agents, or silver nitrate cauterization. It may be indicated in hematemesis or melena (either of which can be a presentation of posterior epistaxis).\n\nContraindications\nPatients with respiratory compromise may first require airway control and mechanical ventilation. Patients with hemodynamic compromise may first require volume and blood product resuscitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Arytenoidectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nArytenoidectomy is a permanent and irreversible surgical procedure whereby the laryngeal inlet is widened in its transverse axis, providing a larger airway for respiration. Arytenoidectomy is performed in cases of bilateral vocal fold immobility caused by either paralysis of the vocal cords or their fixation.\n\n\nStatic enlargement of the glottis is the final and permanent surgical solution for bilateral vocal fold immobility for any cause. It may be broadly divided into a conservative procedure (transverse cordotomy and medial arytenoidectomy) and a radical procedure (total arytenoidectomy).\n [1] Ossoff described the classic total (complete) arytenoidectomy procedure in 1983.\n [2] Dennis and Kashima first described the procedure of transverse cordotomy or posterior cordectomy in 1989.\n [3] Medial arytenoidectomy (partial arytenoidectomy) was described in 1993 by Crumley.\n [4] \nThe first endolaryngeal arytenoidectomy was performed by Thornell in 1948.\n [5] In endolaryngeal microsurgical arytenoidectomy, the vocal cord is thinned by partial submucosal resection of the muscles and by vertical division of the conus elasticus, which further widens the glottis chink.\n [6] Additional steps may ensure a favorable outcome, such as hitching the posterior end of the vocal cord to the vestibular fold, using tissue glue instead of sutures to close the surgical defect, and excision of the arytenoid with laser.\n\n\n\n\nArytenoidectomy can be performed endoscopically by conventional cold steel microsurgery or with the use of laser; currently, the latter is the more popular approach.\n [7, 8, 9] Arytenoidectomy can also be done by an external or open method if laser is not available, if previous endoscopic or microsurgical procedures have failed, or in cases for which access to the area is limited by anatomical distortions.\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the advent of arytenoidectomy, recurrent laryngeal nerve anastomosis was performed. However, it is not possible to precisely reunite the fibers of the antagonistically acting adductor and abductor muscles because they run in the same nerve bundle. Therefore, the results of this surgery were poor.\n\nExternal lateral fixation of the vocal fold may be done as a temporary or stop-gap measure if future restoration of normal function is possible. This approach can be used if there is mucosal cover present over the posterior glottis. However, this approach has several problems, including the need for definitive treatment, failure due to the suture cutting through the tissues, inadequate widening due to splintering of the arytenoid cartilage if the conus elasticus is not divided at the same time, granulations and formation of scar tissue, and poorer voice quality than can be expected after arytenoidectomy. Hence, external lateral fixation is now largely outdated and arytenoidectomy is preferred.\n\nIndications\nPatients with paralysis or immobility of the vocal cords usually are treated with tracheostomy as a temporary or emergency measure. Patients who are deemed fit for decannulation may be considered for arytenoidectomy.\n\nContraindications\nAbsolute contraindications to arytenoidectomy include aspiration and/or the presence of progressive neurological disease.\n\nRelative contraindications are compromised pulmonary status, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and previous radiation therapy. Particular attention must be given to patients having unrealistic expectations from the procedure. The reluctance of the patient to accept a poor voice quality in lieu of a better airway, possible noncompliance with multiple procedures to stagger the surgical trauma and optimize the vocal outcome, and failure or unwillingness to adhere to rehabilitative measures such as speech therapy should be considered as relative contraindications.\n\nPatients with a tendency to form keloids or hypertrophic scars are not ideal candidates for arytenoidectomy; external laterofixation is a better option for them.\n\nAge is not a contraindication to corrective surgery.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe vocal cords are composed of mucous membrane infoldings that stretch horizontally across the middle laryngeal cavity. They are attached anteriorly at the angle on the interior surface of the thyroid cartilage and project posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages on either side.\n\nThe thyroarytenoid muscles function to draw the arytenoid cartilages forward, thereby relaxing and shortening the vocal cords, while also rotating the arytenoid cartilage inward, thus adducting the vocal folds and narrowing the rima glottis.

However, when both the recurrent laryngeal nerves are divided at primary surgery for thyroid carcinoma, arytenoidectomy can be done as a primary procedure.\n\nComplication Prevention\n\nCarbon dioxide laser precautions are implemented and saline-soaked pledgets are placed in the subglottis to prevent disruption of the endotracheal tube cuff.\n\nThe application of topical mitomycin C (0.5 mg/mL) to the wound for 5 minutes is an optional adjunctive treatment in an attempt to decrease fibroblast formation and scar tissue at the operative site.\n\nAt the end of the procedure, 4% lidocaine spray can be used to minimize postoperative laryngospasm.\n\nOutcomes\nThe main limitation of arytenoidectomy is in the case of posterior glottic stenosis because the scar tissue may be difficult to excise completely. In these cases, cricoid laminotomy with interposition of rib cartilage through an external incision may be attempted. Posterior glottic stenosis should be clearly differentiated preoperatively from paralysis or fixity of the vocal cord and the patient should be informed of the worse prognosis. Also, arytenoidectomy is less successful in bilateral cricoarytenoid joint ankylosis due to trauma, irradiation of larynx or thyroid, and polyarthritis, as compared to results obtained for vocal fold paralysis.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Audiology Pure-Tone Testing": "\nOverview\n\n\nPure-tone audiometry is a behavioral test used to measure hearing sensitivity. This measure involves the peripheral and central auditory systems. Pure-tone thresholds (PTTs) indicate the softest sound audible to an individual at least 50% of the time. Hearing sensitivity is plotted on an audiogram, which is a graph displaying intensity as a function of frequency.\nDegrees of hearing loss\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal hearing (0–25 dB): At this level, hearing is within normal limits.\n\n\n\n\nMild hearing loss (26–40 dB): Mild hearing loss may cause inattention, difficulty suppressing background noise, and increased listening efforts. Patients with this degree of loss may not hear soft speech. Children may be fatigued after listening for long periods.\n\n\n\n\nModerate hearing loss (41–55 dB): Moderate hearing loss may affect language development, syntax and articulation, interaction with peers, and self-esteem. Patients with this degree of loss have trouble hearing some conversational speech.\n\n\n\n\nModerate-severe hearing loss (56–70 dB): Moderate-severe hearing loss may cause difficulty with speech and decreased speech intelligibility. Patients with this degree of loss do not hear most conversational-level speech.\n\n\n\n\nSevere hearing loss (71–90 dB): Severe hearing loss may affect voice quality.\n\n\n\n\nProfound hearing loss (>90 dB): With profound hearing loss (deafness), speech and language deteriorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of hearing loss\nConductive\nConductive hearing loss has normal bone-conduction thresholds, but air-conduction thresholds are poorer than normal by at least 10 dB.\n\n\n\n\nConductive hearing loss is secondary to an outer ear or middle ear abnormality, which can include abnormalities of the tympanic membrane. The abnormality reduces the effective intensity of the air-conducted signal reaching the cochlea, but it does not affect the bone-conducted signal that does not pass through the outer or middle ear.\n\nExamples of abnormalities include occlusion of the external auditory canal by cerumen or a mass, middle ear infection and/or fluid, perforation of the tympanic membrane, or ossicular abnormalities. Pure-tone air-conduction thresholds are poorer than bone-conduction thresholds by more than 10 dB (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudiogram depicting a mild rising conductive hearing loss in the left ear. Note the significant air-bone gaps. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nSensorineural\n\nSensorineural hearing loss has bone- and air-conduction thresholds within 10 dB of each other, and thresholds are higher than 25 dB HL. See image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudiogram depicting a high-frequency sloping sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nSensorineural hearing loss is secondary to cochlear abnormalities and/or an abnormality of the auditory nerve or central auditory pathways. Because, in this type of hearing loss, the outer ear and middle ear do not reduce the signal intensity of the air-conducted signal, both air- and bone-conducted signals are effective in stimulating the cochlea. Pure-tone air- and bone-conduction thresholds are within 10 dB.\n\nExamples included presbycusis, noise-induced hearing loss, Ménière disease, and retrocochlear lesions such as vestibular schwannoma.\n\nMixed\n\nMixed hearing loss has conductive and sensorineural components.\n\nThis type of hearing loss has sensorineural and conductive components. Pure-tone air-conduction thresholds are poorer than bone-conduction thresholds by more than 10 dB, and bone-conduction thresholds are less than 25 dB (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudiogram depicting a mixed sloping hearing loss in the left ear. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nTerminology\nAudiogram\n\nThe audiogram is a chart of hearing sensitivity with frequency charted on the abscissa and intensity on the ordinate (see images shown above). Intensity is the level of sound power measured in decibels; loudness is the perceptual correlate of intensity.\n\nFor threshold testing intensity, decibels are measured in hearing level (HL), which is based on the standardized average of individuals with normal hearing sensitivity. HL is not equivalent to sound pressure level (SPL), but the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has defined a relationship between SPL and HL for each audiometric frequency from 250–8000 Hz.\n\nFrequency\n\nFrequency is cycles per unit of time. Pitch is the perceptual correlate of frequency. Frequency is measured in hertz, which are cycles per second.\n\nUsually frequencies of 250–8000 Hz are used in testing because this range represents most of the speech spectrum, although the human ear can detect frequencies from 20–20,000 Hz. Some children can detect even higher frequencies.\n\nPure-tone average\n\nPure-tone average (PTA) is the average of hearing sensitivity at 500, 1000, and 2000. This average should approximate the speech reception threshold (SRT), within 5 dB, and the speech detection threshold (SDT), within 6–8 dB.\n\nIf the SRT is significantly better than the PTA, the possibility of pseudohypoacusis should be considered. If the PTA is significantly better than the SRT, the possibility of central involvement should be considered.\n\nSpeech reception threshold\n\nThe SRT is the softest intensity spondee words that an individual can repeat at least 50% of the time.\n\nSpondees are bisyllabic words equally emphasizing both syllables. In some cases (eg, patients with poor word recognition), a limited set of words may be used.\n\nSpeech detection threshold\n\nThe speech detection threshold (SDT), also termed the speech awareness threshold (SAT), is the lowest intensity speech stimulus that an individual can detect at least 50% of the time.\n\nWord recognition\n\nWord recognition (formerly called speech discrimination) is the ability to repeat correctly an open set of monosyllabic words at suprathreshold intensity. Word lists are phonetically balanced (PB), meaning that the speech sounds used occur with the same frequency as in the whole language.\n\nThe score represents the percent of words correct for most word recognition tests.\n\nCommon audiogram/audiologic assessment abbreviations\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nCNT - Could not test\n\n\n\n\nDNT - Did not test\n\n\n\n\nHA - Hearing aid\n\n\n\n\nHAE - Hearing aid evaluation\n\n\n\n\nNR - No response\n\n\n\n\nSNHL - Sensorineural hearing loss\n\n\n\n\nWNL - Within normal limits\n\n\n\n\nAU - Both sides (ears)\n\n\n\n\nAS - Left\n\n\n\n\nAD - Right\n\n\n\n\nVT - Vibrotactile response\n\n\n\n\nRTC - Return to clinic\n\n\n\n\nPRN - As needed\n\n\n\n\nBC - Bone conduction\n\n\n\n\nAC - Air conduction\n\n\n\n\nPTA - Pure-tone average\n\n\n\n\nUCL - Uncomfortable loudness level\n\n\n\n\nMCL - Most comfortable loudness level\n\n\n\n\nHFA - High frequency average\n\n\n\n\nHL - Hearing level\n\n\n\n\nSPL - Sound pressure level\n\n\n\n\nSRT - Speech reception threshold\n\n\n\n\nSAT - Speech awareness threshold\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe primary functionality of the middle ear (tympanic cavity) is that of bony conduction of sound via transference of sound waves in the air collected by the auricle to the fluid of the inner ear. The middle ear inhabits the petrous portion of the temporal bone and is filled with air secondary to communication with the nasopharynx via the auditory (eustachian) tube.\n\nThe tympanic membrane (TM) is an oval, thin, semi-transparent membrane that separates the external and middle ear (tympanic cavity). The TM is divided into 2 parts: the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The manubrium of the malleus is firmly attached to the medial tympanic membrane; where the manubrium draws the TM medially, a concavity is formed. The apex of this concavity is called the umbo. The area of the TM superior to the umbo is termed the pars flaccida; the remainder of the TM is the pars tensa.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy, Auditory System Anatomy, and Inner Ear Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Auricular Hematoma Drainage": "\nOverview\n\n\nAuricular hematoma, shown below, is a complication that results from direct trauma to the anterior auricle and is a common facial injury in wrestlers.\n [1, 2, 3] Shearing forces to the anterior auricle can lead to separation of the anterior auricular perichondrium from the underlying, tightly adherent cartilage. This may lead to tearing of the perichondrial blood vessels and subsequent hematoma formation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuricular hematoma. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nThe torn perichondrial vessels compromise the viability of the avascular underlying cartilage. Interestingly, the presence of a subperichondrial hematoma has been found to stimulate new and often asymmetric cartilage to form.\n [4] This deformity, which is often referred to as cauliflower ear or wrestler’s ear (shown in the image below), is often considered a badge of honor among wrestlers and rugby players.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\nCauliflower ear. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of treatment is to completely evacuate subperichondrial blood and to prevent its reaccumulation. The mechanism of hematoma drainage has been debated. To date, no randomized controlled trials have addressed this issue.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe auricle and external acoustic meatus (or external auditory canal) compose the external ear. The external ear functions to collect and amplify sound, which then gets transmitted to the middle ear. The asymmetric shape of the external auricle introduces delays in the path of sound that assist in sound localization.\n\nThe arterial supply of the auricle is composed of the posterior auricular artery, the anterior auricular branch of the superficial temporal artery, and the occipital artery, which also contributes. Veins accompany the corresponding named arteries.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Balloon Sinuplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nChronic sinusitis and related conditions are a dominant medical problem in the United States and worldwide, with more than 30 million Americans affected annually at a cost of more than 4.3 billion dollars.\n [1, 2, 3] Over-the-counter remedies and prescription drugs account for much of the expense, yet provide minimal curative benefit in most patients with chronic sinusitis. Surgical treatment of sinus disease occurs with increasing regularity, at a current rate of approximately 800,000 cases in the United States per year.\nSurgical treatment of sinus disease has been described in the medical literature for more than 3 centuries. In the past, most sinus surgery addressed the emergent complications of acute sinus infection. With modern medical care, these complications have become far less frequent. Currently, most sinus-related surgical cases in the United States consist of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.\n [4] \n\n\nChronic disease is a more insidious constellation of illnesses, not necessarily manifesting as fungal or bacterial infection. Many cases are related to other systemic illnesses such as asthma, connective tissue disorder, uncontrolled allergic or inflammatory disease, or systemic immunologic dysfunction. These procedures are performed when aggressive medical therapy does not resolve functional obstruction of normal sinus ostia by intranasal swelling, obstruction of the nasal passage itself by inflammatory disease such as polyps, or recalcitrant sinus opacification.\nEven with modern functional endoscopic techniques,\n [5] unfortunately, sinus surgery leaves much to be desired for many patients. Unlike certain other general surgical procedures for infection prevention and treatment, such as appendectomy or cholecystectomy, sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis is often performed multiple times on a single patient and is rarely deemed to be curative.\n\n\n\n\nIn sinus surgery, the affected organ is not removed; in fact, it may be made more diseased by a poorly performed operation. Scar tissue formation, recurrence and persistence of inflammatory or infectious conditions in the nose and sinuses, and untreated systemic illness all doom many sinus patients to failure and recurrent operation.\n\n\n\n\nSurgeons have increasingly recognized the importance of preserving or restoring normal sinus anatomy. For example, early efforts to establish indirect or gravity-related drainage of the maxillary sinuses, by Caldwell-Luc or inferior meatal window procedures, have since been realized to confound the natural mucociliary clearance of the sinus and have largely been abandoned. The more anatomic and physiologic method of reopening and enlarging the natural drainage pathways from the sinuses to the nasal passages is the basis of modern FESS.\n\nThe FESS of today differs significantly from the sinus surgery performed even a few years ago. Advanced fellowship training in rhinology and sinus surgery, offered by a dedicated rhinology faculty, is becoming more prevalent. Understanding of mucociliary clearance, the relationship between sinus and pulmonary function, and the allergic and immunologic properties of the sinuses and nose have developed significantly.\n\nBalloon sinus dilation (BSD) represents the first step toward tissue preservation technique and away from the destructive access techniques necessary for FESS. Much like angioplasty is used to open coronary arteries and avoid bypass graft surgery, BSD offers patients with chronic sinusitis the possibility of complete preservation and restoration of the native sinus anatomy.\n\nThe technique was first proposed in 2006 by Bolger and Vaughan as a safe, effective, and reliable means of establishing patent sinus ostia.\n [6] Following the publication of this cadaver study, subsequent multicenter studies in living patients demonstrated similar safety and effectiveness profiles.\n [7, 8, 9] \n\nIndications\nThe indications for balloon sinus dilation (BSD) treatment for sinus disease are the same as those for standard functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Like FESS, BSD is intended to allow as permanent as possible access to and ventilation of obstructed sinuses, thereby allowing normal function to resume and ongoing maintenance therapies to be effective. For more information, see Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.\n\nHowever, BSD by itself is appropriate for only a subset of patients who qualify for FESS. Since BSD is used solely for dilation of obstructed ostia, its use is limited to the frontal, sphenoid, and maxillary (ie, extranasal) sinuses. BSD may be considered the treatment of choice for limited or moderate disease involving these sinuses.\n\nIn patients with significant ethmoid disease, BSD can be used as an adjunct to standard ethmoidectomy. BSD is performed either before or after ethmoidectomy, depending upon the preference of the surgeon to preserve normal anatomy for BSD landmark purposes.\n\nContraindications\nPatients with pansinus polyposis, extensive fungal disease, advanced connective tissue disease, or suspected neoplasm should not be considered for BSD as the principal modality.\n\nOpacification of a sinus by solid tissue inhibits view and access with the Entellus device, and such disease cannot be cleared with either the Entellus or the Acclarent device. The surgeon must consider that the access to these sinuses afforded by dilation of the native ostium would likely be inadequate for extirpation of disease or for maintenance of drainage postoperatively with topical treatment.\n\nBSD is not appropriate for use in patients who require revision surgery or in those with severe disease in which bony thickening or dehiscence of the orbital wall or skull base bone have occurred.\n\nNo surgical treatment should be offered in the absence of comprehensive medical treatment, including antibiotics, steroids, nasal hygiene, and liberal use of topical nasal therapies. For more information on these therapies, see Chronic Sinusitis. Even in patients who have received extensive treatment by a primary care practitioner, insurance payors often require further aggressive medical treatment under the specific direction of the subspecialist before authorizing surgical treatment.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe key nasal sidewall and roof structures, including the uncinate process, the ethmoidal bulla, and the middle and superior turbinates, serve as guides to find the maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid ostia. See the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral nasal wall anatomy and paranasal sinus ostia. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndoscopic view of sinus ostia location in the lateral nasal wall. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadaveric anatomy of the lateral nasal wall. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe ethmoid bulla is a constant landmark during endoscopic surgery and is usually the largest of the anterior ethmoidal cells. It lies posterior to the uncinate process, superior to the infundibulum, and anterior to the basal lamella. The ethmoid bulla often extends all the way to the skull base but sometimes is attached to the skull base via the bulla lamella.\n\nThe sphenoid sinus ostium is in the posterior nasal cavity approximately 1.5 cm above the roof of the nasal pharynx. It is generally medial to the superior turbinate. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected location of the sphenoid ostium. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nA recent cadaver study has demonstrated uniform location of the ostium in this medial location.\n [10] This challenges historic and practical experience that sometimes (approximately 15% of the time), the most straightforward access to the sphenoid is lateral to the superior turbinate.\n [11] Regardless,, the surgeon should initiate the search for the ostium as medially and inferiorly as possible to minimize bleeding, tissue injury, or other risk to the skull base, optic apparatus, internal carotid, cavernous sinus, or pituitary sella.\n\nFor more on developmental anatomy of the sphenoid, please see Surgical Treatment of Acute Sphenoid Sinusitis.\n [12] \n\nThe traditional depth measurement for the sphenoid sinus wall is 7 cm from the nasal sill; this is helpful when accessing a difficult sphenoid sinus through a narrow nasal cavity or past large turbinate structures. The sinus access is typically 30 degrees elevated from the nasal floor using angulation from the sill.\n\nTrajectory-based identification of angle and depth becomes less important when performing lateral fluoroscopy for BSD, as described in the Technique section below, than when using a lighted guidewire to enter the sinus with a more indirect indication of true sinus entry.\n\nPreoperative evaluation of CT imaging in multiple planes identifies Onodi or sphenoethmoid cells that may obscure or obstruct sphenoid access or later outflow.\n [13, 14] The presence of these cells may also jeopardize safe instrumentation of the sinus.\n\nIntramaxillary sinus anatomy, which is seen with the Entellus device, is different than that familiar to the surgeon trained to perform standard FESS. Native internal maxillary sinus anatomy is rarely seen in the course of traditional nasal or head and neck surgery, but it is seen in microscopic detail in the passing of a camera and balloon into the maxillary sinus and subsequently through the ostium in the medial maxillary wall.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Paranasal Sinus Anatomy, Nasal Anatomy, and Skull Base Anatomy.\n\nSetting for the Procedure\nBalloon sinus dilation (BSD) needs to be performed in a setting that provides adequate patient and surgeon comfort and sufficient equipment resources to respond to BSD failure or other unexpected challenges.\n\nIn most practice situations, BSD is performed only in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia. In rare instances, BSD may be performed in an office environment with an awake patient under local anesthesia.\n\nAmbulatory and office-based BSD have both medical and economic pitfalls. Reimbursement may be problematic, as payors in most communities only contract for hospital-based usage of BSD devices by pass-through consumable allowance. On the other hand, if performance of BSD in the clinic setting demonstrates sufficient cost savings, this could result in the erosion of future privilege to perform the procedure in a hospital or operating room setting, because of mandates from payors.\n\nMedical pitfalls include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nExtensive bleeding, leading to nasal packing and patient discomfort\n\n\n\n\nPatient discomfort (somatic and psychological)\n\n\n\n\nFailure to treat because of inadequate visualization or instrumentation\n\n\n\n\nLack of resources for microbiology and pathology for careful receipt and processing of received fluids or tissue\n\n\n\n\nEarly recurrence of disease from lack of thoroughness\n\n\n\nFinally, clinic-based BSD can place stress on office staff. It may also lead to reduced patient follow-up, as a result of many of the above mentioned factors\n\nSome of the situations in which BSD may be considered for ambulatory or office-based settings include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nObstructive scar tissue in the veteran sinus-surgery patient\n\n\n\n\nRevision of isolated frontal, sphenoid, or maxillary early restenosis after FESS or BSD in a well-counseled and comfortable patient\n\n\n\n\nIsolated maxillary treatment in a well-counseled and well-anesthetized patient who is highly motivated to avoid general anesthesia\n\n\n\n\nPatients with unacceptable general anesthesia risk\n\n\n\n\nSinus treatment in an obtunded, hospitalized patient in the intensive care unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Biopsy, Fine Needle, Neck Mass": "\nOverview\n\n\nFine needle biopsy (FNB) is a procedure in which a small-caliber needle is placed into a mass, cellular material is removed, and a cytologic diagnosis is rendered.\n [1] It is widely accepted as one of the most useful diagnostic procedures in the evaluation of neck masses. Fine needle biopsy helps to distinguish inflammatory, reactive, or cystic lesions from neoplasms as well as benign neoplastic lesions from malignant ones. Fine needle biopsy is relatively safe, simple, and cost-effective, and it is well-tolerated by most patients. However, close attention must be paid to proper technique to ensure accurate results.\nFine needle biopsy can be performed with or without aspiration. Both techniques are described here. The more commonly used aspiration technique uses syringe-created negative pressure as well as the shearing effect of the needle to collect material from the biopsied lesion. In contrast, Zajdela et al described a technique in which only a bare fine needle without suction was used to obtain material from the target lesion.\n [2] This nonaspiration technique, also called the Zajdela (pronounced zidel-a) or fine-needle capillary method, relies on capillary action to draw the sheared cells within the small-caliber needle.\n [3, 4] \n\n\nAdvocates for the nonaspiration (Zajdela) technique believe that grasping the needle hub directly improves operator sensitivity in placing the needle tip within a small lesion. They also believe that less bleeding occurs with the nonaspiration technique, an advantage in the biopsy of more vascular tissue such as the thyroid gland.\n [4, 5] Studies have shown no statistically significant difference between aspiration and nonaspiration techniques in the successful retrieval of cytologic material.\n [5] \nRelevant Anatomy\nThe neck is the part of the body that separates the head from the torso. The Latin-derived term cervical means \"of the neck.\" The neck supports the weight of the head and is highly flexible, allowing the head to turn and flex in different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe midline in front of the neck has a prominence of the thyroid cartilage termed the laryngeal prominence, or the so-called \"Adam's apple.\" Between the Adam’s apple and the chin, the hyoid bone can be felt; below the thyroid cartilage, a further ring that can be felt in the midline is the cricoid cartilage. Between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch, the trachea and isthmus of the thyroid gland can be felt.\n\nThe quadrangular area is on the side of the neck and is bounded superiorly by the lower border of the body of the mandible and the mastoid process, inferiorly by the clavicle, anteriorly by a midline in front of the neck, and posteriorly by the trapezius muscle.\n\nThe image below depicts the anterior cervical muscles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnterior cervical muscles. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Neck Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Botulinum Toxin for Laryngeal Dystonia": "\nBackground\n\n\nLaryngeal dystonia (LD) is a muscle-contraction disorder of the larynx and laryngeal musculature. It was once referred to as spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which refers to a group of dystonias, or muscle-contraction disorders, in which involuntary muscle movements in a particular organ or region of the body interfere with normal function. However, the term spasmodic dysphonia is an inaccurate description of laryngeal dystonia, since no lesion in the pyramidal or extrapyramidal tract has yet been identified to account for the spasticity.\n [1] \nOther synonyms of historical significance for laryngeal dystonia have included spastic aphonia, spastic dysphonia, phonic laryngeal spasm, coordinated laryngeal spasm, mogiphonia, laryngeal stuttering, and nervous hoarseness. \n\n\nAlthough Traube is believed to have coined the term “spasmodic dysphonia” in 1871, further extensive studies using electromyography and, subsequently, the use of botulinum toxin to treat laryngeal dystonia in 1986 are credited to Blitzer and his colleagues.\n [2] \nLaryngeal dystonias are classified according to the specific muscle(s) involved, into 4 distinct types, as follows:\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\nAdductor type: This type accounts for most cases of laryngeal dystonia, around 80%. In this condition, the true vocal cords close intermittently and irregularly during connected speech, resulting in voice breaks and a strained, strangled voice quality and effortful speech. \n\n\n\n\nAbductor type: This type is rare and causes a soft, whispery voice due to increased breathiness and vocal air escape. Complete aphonia can occur in severe cases. \n\n\n\n\nMixed type: This has features of both adductor and abductor types.\n\n\n\n\nAdductor laryngeal breathing dysphonia (ALBD): In this condition, the voice is normal, but there is an inspiratory stridor, which may persist and complicate swallowing, leading to paroxysmal cough and dysphagia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaryngeal dystonia is characterized by the severe impairment of connected speech without associated problems with singing, humming, or laughing or related activities such as yawning, yelling, or sneezing. \n\nLaryngeal dystonia is usually precipitated by stress and may be temporarily controlled with alcohol, tranquilizers, and/or sedatives. It must be distinguished from essential voice tremor, functional aphonia, malingering, and neurological diseases. Associated focal dystonias in other areas may be seen, such as torticollis, blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, strabismus, and writer’s cramp.\n [3] \n\nLaryngeal dystonia is significantly more common in female than in males, and its peak age of onset is 35-45 years. Familial clustering has been reported. \n\nA detailed history and thorough physical examination are essential to diagnose the condition and to rule out other neurological lesions.\n [1] Investigations of choice in laryngeal dystonia are fiberoptic laryngoscopy and laryngeal videostroboscopy. Other tests include aerodynamic, acoustic, perceptual, and spectral voice analysis. \n\nLaryngeal dystonias result from poorly coordinated muscle movement; therefore, treatment involves weakening one side of the agonist and antagonist groups of muscle.\n [1] Although laryngeal dystonias have no known cure, various pharmacological, surgical, and physiotherapeutic options may be used for treatment.\n [1] Injection of botulinum toxin (BT) is now the criterion standard of treatment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Canalith-Repositioning Maneuvers": "\nOverview\n\n\nOne of the most common causes of vertigo is benign positional vertigo (BPV), also known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is usually due to free-floating, misplaced otoliths that have inappropriately entered one of the semicircular canals of the inner ear.\nThe Epley maneuver, or canalith repositioning procedure (CRP), was invented by John Epley.\n [1] The Epley maneuver with various modifications can be used to move these otoliths out of the posterior or anterior semicircular canals and place them in the utricle where they belong.\n [2] The Epley maneuver is now widely used as a first-line treatment of vertical (posterior or anterior) canal BPPV.\n [3] It is safe in elderly patients and can be performed at the bedside within a matter of minutes.\n [4] The Semont maneuver may also used for this condition\n [5, 6] as well as for the cupulolithiasis variant (in which the otoliths are not free-floating but instead are attached to the cupula in the semicircular canal). Many do not recommend the Semont maneuver in elderly patients because of the more violent nature of the maneuver.\n\n\nHorizontal canal BPV (H-BPV) is less common than posterior canal BPV but causes more severe symptoms of nausea and vertigo.\n [7] Numerous effective maneuvers are available for treating H-BPV, including the Gufoni,\n [8] Vannuchi-Asprella,\n [9] and barbecue roll\n [10] methods.\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe inner ear, also called the labyrinthine cavity, functions to conduct sound to the central nervous system (CNS) as well as to assist in balance. Auditory transduction, the conversion of acoustic (mechanical) energy to electrochemical energy, takes place within the labyrinthine cavity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe labyrinthine cavity is essentially formed of the membranous labyrinth encased in the bony osseus labyrinth. The osseus labyrinth is a series of bony cavities within the petrous temporal bone; the membranous labyrinth is the communicating membranous sacs and ducts housed within the osseus labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth is cushioned by the surrounding perilymph and contains the endolymph within its confines. The membranous labyrinth also has cochlear, vestibular, and semicircular components.\n\nThere are 3 bony semicircular canals; each stands at right angles to the other 2 canals.

        "Canalplasty": "\nBackground\n\n\nA canalplasty is performed to widen a narrowed (either congenitally or acquired) external auditory canal (EAC). The procedure is performed for a number of reasons. The most common reason for canalplasty is to enhance access for mastoid surgery or during a lateral graft tympanoplasty. Other primary reasons include removal of bony or soft tissue growths or scar tissue, or as part of surgery for aural atresia, which is addressed elsewhere. The motivation for surgery in these later cases may be chronic infection, trapped debris, or hearing loss due to an occluded EAC. The benefits of the procedure are improved drainage of the ear and potentially improved hearing as well.\nEmbryology\nThe external auditory canal (EAC) develops out of the first branchial groove or cleft. The groove deepens at 8 weeks to form the primary EAC that will develop into the adult cartilaginous EAC. A tubular structure called the meatal plate then forms at the medial aspect of this groove. This is a core of epithelial cells that typically canalizes around 21 weeks of development. The cells from the cord contribute to the bony EAC and the epithelial lining of the canal, including the lateral epithelium of the tympanic membrane.\n [1] Anomalies in this development can lead to canal aplasia, atresia, stenosis, or duplication.\n\n\nAnatomy\nIn adulthood, the EAC is approximately 2.5 cm in length and composed of a lateral cartilaginous portion and a medial bony portion (see the image below). The medial bony structure of the external auditory canal primarily consists of the tympanic bone, a ringed lateral projection of the temporal bone. A superior notch in the tympanic bone is called the notch of Rivinus, which is located at the junction of tympanosquamous and tympanomastoid suture lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-section of the middle and inner ear. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensory innervation to the EAC consists of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe auriculotemporal nerve (from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve) provides sensory information from the anterior wall and roof\n\n\n\n\nThe posterior wall and floor sensibility is carried in the nerve fibers of the auricular branch of vagus (Arnold nerve)\n\n\n\n\nThe tympanic plexus offers some contributions\n\n\n\nThe arterial supply includes the posterior auricular artery, deep auricular branch of the maxillary artery, and superficial temporal artery.\n\nImportant anatomic relationships should be considered prior to performing a canalplasty. Just anterior to the bony portion of the EAC are the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and the parotid gland. As this area is often the site of surgery, care is needed in the operating room to avoid penetration of the TMJ. In addition, posterior and inferior to the EAC is the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, in which the facial nerve courses, usually just lateral to the annulus in the posteroinferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane.\n [2] \n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy.\n\nFunction\nThe primary purpose of the external auditory canal is conduction of acoustic energy to the tympanic membrane. The canal has a resonance frequency of 2-3 kHz, which may facilitate conductance of frequencies helpful for speech discrimination. The skin lining the EAC also allows clearance of debris and protection from pathogens. The outer third of the EAC is lined by skin containing hair follicles and cerumen-producing glands, which facilitate a slightly acidic environment. The frequent shedding and lateral migration of canal skin allows gradual clearance of debris.\n [3] \n\nAlthough congenital lesions occluding of the EAC such as aural atresia or congenital canal stenosis are indications for canalplasty, acquired lesions are more commonly encountered. External auditory exostoses (EAE) and osteomas are hyperostotic growths of the external auditory canal (see image below). Increased prevalence has been noted in swimmers, scuba divers, and others exposed to cold water, and EAE is often found bilaterally.\n [4] The cause of this bony growth, however, is unknown. An additional acquired cause of EAC occlusion, medial canal fibrosis, is an inflammatory condition that leads to scar formation in the canal and that may result from chronic inflammation or prior otologic surgery.\n [5, 6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nempty para to satisfy content model\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe most common indication for surgery for acquired EAC occlusion is otitis externa refractory to medical management. Surgery can improve the success of topical treatment and improve access to prevent debris accumulation. Patient presenting symptoms include recurrent otitis externa, sensation of plugging, hearing loss, pain, and tinnitus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Cerumen Impaction Removal": "\nOverview\n\n\nRemoval of cerumen (wax) from the ear forms a significant part of the workload of an otolaryngologist and is, therefore, an essential skill to master.\n [1, 2] However, general practitioners, emergency department staff, nurses, audiologists, audiological physicians, and alternative medicine practitioners may all be confronted with the scenario of excess ear wax that causes difficulty in examination, hearing loss, or discomfort.\n [3] \nCerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both.\n [4] \n\n\nIn an evaluation of 279 children with acute otitis media with effusion, ear wax needed to be removed to visualize the tympanic membrane in 29% of consultations.\n [5] \nMany options are available to attempt to clear ear wax. These include the following:\n\n\n\n\nConservative approach\nAdvising the patient to avoid the use of cotton tip applicators for routine cleaning. Normal external ear canal skin will desquamate in such a way  that wax tends to be pushed to the outside. Regular “cleaning” with cotton tip applicators may be pushing wax deeper into the canal.\n\n\n\n\nWax-softening drops\nA multitude of over-the-counter and commercially available products are sold. Opinion varies on which is the most effective. These products can usually be divided into wate- based (such as peroxide ear drops), oil-based  (such as olive oil), and non-water non-oil based (such as carbamide peroxide and glycerol-combination preparations).\n [6] \n\nWax-softening drops are intended to soften the wax over a period of hours to days. It is often prescribed for 2 weeks for maximal effect. The drops may be enough to clear obstruction as the ear canal skin will assist in pushing out the wax over time. However, these may also worsen the patient symptoms in the short term by converting a partial obstruction to a complete blockage. In these cases, mechanical wax removal under vision (micro-suctioning) or irrigation of the ear may need to be considered to improve symptoms.\n\nEar irrigation\nThis procedure involves the use of warm (ideally body temperature) water under pressure directed into the ear canal to mechanically remove the wax. While a seemingly simple procedure it has a significant risk of damaging the tympanic membrane (ear drum) and middle ear structures, which led to it being a common reason for litigation in general practice in the past. Pressure-controlled devices limit the risk but tympanic membranes vary in strength from patient to patient and the risk of damage remains. Ear irrigation should not be undertaken without undergoing specific training, taking a full otological history, otological examination, seeking informed consent from the patient, and with the correct pressure-limited instrumentation.\n\nMechanical wax removal under vision\nThis is typically done using an operating microscope with the patient awake. The operating microscope affords depth perception and allows accurate targeting of the wax. The wax may be removed with small suction tips (micro-suction), small forceps (called crocodile forceps), blunt instruments (for example, Jobson Horne Probes), or small cotton tip applicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect patient and care provider positioning is important and improves visualization of the external canal and tympanic membrane. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Cricothyroidotomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nCricothyroidotomy, also known as cricothyrotomy, is an important emergency procedure that is used to obtain an airway when other, more routine methods (eg, laryngeal mask airway [LMA] and endotracheal intubation) are ineffective or contraindicated. Establishing an effective airway in the face of medical emergencies is a skill that healthcare providers must master to prevent patient morbidity or mortality.\n\n\nIndications\nCricothyroidotomy is indicated upon failure to obtain an airway with traditional methods in the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrauma causing oral, pharyngeal, or nasal hemorrhage\n\n\n\n\nFacial muscle spasms or laryngospasm\n\n\n\n\nUncontrollable emesis\n\n\n\n\nUpper airway stenosis or congenital deformities\n\n\n\n\nClenched teeth\n\n\n\n\nTumor, cancer, or another disease process or trauma causing mass effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirway obstruction indications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nOropharyngeal edema (eg, anaphylaxis)\n\n\n\n\nForeign body obstruction\n\n\n\nThe following are relative indications for cricothyroidotomy:\n\n\n\n\n\nCervical spine immobilization secondary to injury\n\n\n\n\nMaxillofacial injuries\n\n\n\nNonemergent indications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nProlonged intubation\n\n\n\n\nMaxillofacial, laryngeal, or oral surgery\n\n\n\n\nBronchoscopy\n [12, 13, 14] \n\n\n\nContraindications\nThe only absolute contraindication to surgical cricothyroidotomy is age, although the exact age at which a surgical cricothyrotomy can be safely performed is controversial and has not been well defined. Various sources list lower age limits ranging from 5 years\n [15] to 12 years\n [16] , and Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) defines the pediatric airway as age 1-8 years.\n\nThe most conservative approach is to use 12 years as the cutoff age. In patients below this cutoff age, needle cricothyrotomy is indicated because infants and children younger than 12 years have a smaller cricothyroid membrane and a more funnel-shaped, rostral, and compliant larynx.\n [12] \n\nA commercially available set has now been developed for minimally invasive cricothyroidotomy in infants (Quicktrach baby™).\n [22] The set consists of a plastic cannula over a metal needle for direct placement in the trachea. So far, however, this device has not been evaluated for its intended use.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nA permanent tracheostomy should be placed within 24 hours. Needle cricothyrotomy can be used for approximately 40 minutes, after which time carbon dioxide accumulates; this can be particularly devastating in patients with head trauma.\n [12, 20] In addition, stomas maintained via cricothyroidotomy for more than 2 days are associated with a higher risk of glottic and subglottic stenosis than tracheostomies are.\n [13] \n\nIn a 2005 study comparing the Seldinger technique with the standard surgical technique (see Technique), the time to tracheal puncture and ventilation was significantly longer with the latter. In addition, injury to the thyroid vasculature was more common with the standard surgical technique.\n [21] \n\nExpected Outcomes\nSuccess rates for intubations performed in the emergency department (ED) are high; rescue cricothyrotomy is required in only 0.7% of adult patients\n [1] and in fewer than 1% of pediatric patients.\n [2] \n\nThe success rate for cricothyrotomy has been similarly high (89%-100%) in most of the studies done to date,\n [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] whether in the field or in the ED, though 1 study reported a success rate of only 62.5%.\n [11] One study found a failed ED cricothyrotomy rate of 3.6%\n [8] ; earlier ED studies documented failure rates ranging from 7.9% to 10%.\n [4, 5] \n\nA meta-analysis that sought to determine pooled estimates of the success rates of alternative airway devices, needle cricothyroidotomy, and surgical cricothyroidotomy found that needle cricothyroidotomy had a comparatively low rate of success (65.8%) but that surgical cricothyroidotomy had a much higher success rate (90.5%) and should be considered the preferred approach.\n [23] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe thyroid gland is ensheathed by the visceral fascia, a division of the middle layer of deep cervical fascia, which attaches it firmly to the laryngoskeleton. The anterior suspensory ligament extends from the superior-medial aspect of each thyroid lobe to the cricoid and thyroid cartilage. The posteromedial aspect of the gland is attached to the side of the cricoid cartilage, first and second tracheal ring, by the posterior suspensory ligament (ie, Berry ligament). This firm attachment of the gland to the laryngoskeleton is responsible for movement of the thyroid gland and related structures during swallowing.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Thyroid Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Dislodged Tracheostomy Positioning Technique": "\nBackground\n\n\nTracheostomy tube placement has long been used to prolong ventilation and to treat upper airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea. Traditionally, tracheostomy tubes were placed via an open technique in the operating room; however, they are now also being performed in intensive care units via either open or percutaneous techniques.\nIt is estimated that 15%-20% of patients in intensive care units will require a tracheostomy.\n [1] Of these, approximately 20% will not survive until hospital discharge, in most cases because of underlying medical problems and not typically because of tracheostomy-related complications.\n\n\nShah et al (2012) performed a retrospective cohort study of over 113,000 tracheostomy patients and cited an overall 3.2% rate of complications.\n [2] \nThe following are among the many potential complications of a tracheostomy:\n\n\n\n\n\nBleeding\n\n\n\n\nEarly decannulation or tube dislodgement\n\n\n\n\nMucous plugging\n\n\n\n\nTracheoesophageal fistula\n\n\n\n\nPersistent tracheocutaneous fistula\n\n\n\n\nTracheitis\n\n\n\n\nTracheal stenosis\n\n\n\n\nTracheoinnominate fistula\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis topic focuses on tracheostomy tube dislodgement, which can happen in any patient.

        "Dizziness Evaluation": "\nOverview\n\n\nIn the evaluation of a patient who experiences dizziness, the examiner's initial efforts must be directed at determining the exact nature of the patient's symptoms because the pathophysiology determines the patient's sensations.\n [1, 2] Precisely understanding the symptoms determines the workup. For example, in a patient with syncope or presyncope, the cause of the sensation is probably cardiovascular and not inner ear. In contrast, in a patient with a sensation of spinning or whirling, the pathology probably involves the inner ear or vestibular nerve on one side, although insults to the cerebellum and brainstem may also produce true vertigo. Therefore, the cause in a patient with true vertigo cannot be assumed to be peripheral.\nAlthough close questioning and careful examination usually reveal important differences, conditions such as multiple sclerosis, migraine equivalent, and vertebrobasilar transient ischemic episodes may simulate peripheral vestibulopathy. Vertigo, the hallmark of inner ear disease, is defined as the illusion of movement of either one's self or one's environment. Details on assessing the patient's current and medical history are presented in the Technique section below.\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe vestibular system, which is the system of balance, consists of 5 distinct end organs: 3 semicircular canals that are sensitive to angular accelerations (head rotations) and 2 otolith organs that are sensitive to linear (or straight-line) accelerations.\n\n\n\n\nThe semicircular canals (see the image below) are arranged as a set of 3 mutually orthogonal sensors; that is, each canal is at a right angle to the other 2. This is similar to the way 3 sides of a box meet at each corner and are at a right angle to one another. Furthermore, each canal is maximally sensitive to rotations that lie in the plane of the canal. The result of this arrangement is that 3 canals can uniquely specify the direction and amplitude of any arbitrary head rotation. The canals are organized into functional pairs wherein both members of the pair lie in the same plane. Any rotation in that plane is excitatory to one of the members of the pair and inhibitory to the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the labyrinth. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Vestibular System Anatomy, Visual System Anatomy, Extraocular Muscle Actions, Extraocular Muscle Anatomy, and Inner Ear Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Double-Lumen Endotracheal Tube Placement": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nDouble-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) placement is the most common technique to achieve lung separation. The lungs are paired organs interconnected by bronchi and trachea that function as one unit. However, isolation of one side from another may be required to optimize visualization for certain surgical procedures within the thoracic cavity, such as operations on the lung tissue, esophagus, mediastinal structures, thoracic vasculature, and thoracic spine. Additionally, lung isolation allows for management of certain pathological conditions of the lung including unilateral lung hemorrhage, infection, trauma, bullous disease, or bronchopleural fistula. \n\n\nThe DLT, comprising two parrallel lumens, is placed through the vocal cords into the trachea with the shorter tracheal lumen terminating in the trachea, and a second, longer lumen extending into either the left or right main bronchus. Each lumen has a cuff that is inflated to create a seal. This allows the clinician to ventilate both lungs or the right or left lungs independently.\n [1, 2, 3, 4]  The ventilated lung is referred to as the dependent or non-operative lung. A DLT is designated as either left or right, depending on which bronchus the bronchial lumen is designed to terminate in. Left-sided DLTs are used more frequently as they are significantly easier to place without obstructing the upper lobe bronchus. A right DLT includes an orifice along the bronchial tube to align with and ventilate the RUL. The image below depicts a double-lumen endotracheal tube.\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble-lumen endotracheal tube. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to other methods of lung separation (bronchial blocker, and single-lumen endobronchial tube placement) a DLT is advantageous because both lungs can be accessed for ventilation, fiberoptic visualisation, suctioning, or application of CPAP. It is also quicker and easier to place than a bronchial blocker.\n [5]  \n\n\n\n\nHowever, because of their significantly larger size and stiffness, DLTs have a higher propensity for trauma after insertion, may be challenging to place in patients with difficult airways, and are not intented for post-operative ventilation. In addition, right-sided DLTs are difficult to place without obstructing the right upper lobe bronchus.\n\nIndications\nOne-lung ventilation may be indicated for a number of situations.\n [6, 7] Generally, lung separation may be used to confine infection or bleeding to one lung, separate ventilation to each lung for certain pulmonary pathology, or for severe hypoxemia due to unilateral lung disease. In addition, it may be indicated for lung resection, repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm, esophageal surgery, bronchoalveolar lavage, or thorascopy.\n [8] \n\nAbsolute indications are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation of each lung to prevent contamination of a healthy lung (eg, infection, massive hemorrhage)\n\n\n\n\nControl of distribution of ventilation to only one lung (eg, bronchopleural/bronchopleural cutaneous fistulas, unilateral cyst or bullae, major bronchial trauma/disruption)\n\n\n\n\nUnilateral lung lavage\n\n\n\n\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)\n\n\n\nRelative indications are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThoracic aortic aneurysm\n\n\n\n\nPneumonectomy\n\n\n\n\nLung volume reduction\n\n\n\n\nMinimally invasive cardiac surgery\n\n\n\n\nUpper lobectomy\n\n\n\n\nEsophageal procedures\n\n\n\n\nLobectomy (middle and lower lobes)\n\n\n\n\nMediastinal mass resection\n\n\n\n\nThymectomy\n\n\n\n\nBilateral sympathectomies\n\n\n\nContraindications\nA double-lumen endotracheal tube should not be placed in the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficult airway\n\n\n\n\nSmall patients\n\n\n\n\nAirway lesion or tumor\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe anatomy of the respiratory system can be divided into 2 major parts, airway anatomy and lung anatomy.\n\nAirway anatomy can be further subdivided into the following 2 segments:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extrathoracic (superior) airway, which includes the supraglottic, glottic, and infraglottic regions\n\n\n\n\nThe intrathoracic (inferior) airway, which includes the trachea, the mainstem bronchi, and multiple bronchial generations (which have as their main function the conduction of air to the alveolar surface)\n\n\n\nLung anatomy includes the lung parenchyma, which carries part of the conduction system but is mainly involved in the gas exchange at the alveolar level. The lung parenchyma is further subdivided into lobes and segments. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLungs, anterior view. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe trachea is nearly but not quite cylindrical, flattened posteriorly. In cross-section, it is D-shaped, with incomplete cartilaginous rings anteriorly and laterally, and a straight membranous wall overlying the trachealis muscle that runs longitutidinaly along the posterior wall of the trachea. The trachea measures about 11 cm in length and is chondromembranous. This structure starts from the inferior part of the larynx (cricoid cartilage) in the neck, opposite the 6th cervical vertebra, to the intervertebral disc between T4-5 vertebrae in the thorax, where it divides at the carina into the right and left bronchi.\n\nThe bronchus (from Greek bronkhos \"windpipe\") is the part of the respiratory system that connects the trachea to the lung parenchyma. It is composed of an extensive branching system of airway passages that transmit the air from the atmosphere to the alveoli (the gas-exchange units). The right main bronchus is shorter and steeper than the left, with its upper lobe branch take-off occuring closer to the carina. Knowledge of the tracheal-bronchial anatomy and it's endoscopic appearance is vital for successful placement confirmation with the bronchoscope.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Lung Anatomy, Trachea Anatomy, and Bronchial Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Dynamic Voice Evaluation Using Flexible Endoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIndirect mirror laryngoscopy is the traditional modality used to perform laryngeal examinations on dysphonic patients.\n [1] The rod lens telescope, introduced by Hopkins, has several advantages over the traditional indirect laryngoscope. It produces a magnified, recordable image of the larynx that is superior for the diagnosis of mass lesions and mucosal wave abnormalities, especially when performing stroboscopy. The drawback to rigid laryngovideostroboscopy remains that the larynx is tethered in a nonphysiologic position and subtle changes in laryngeal function cannot always be assessed accurately.\nThe flexible fiberoptic laryngoscope, introduced by Sawashima and Hirose in 1968, allows visualization of the larynx with the patient in a comfortable, natural position.\n [2] More recently, \"chip-tip\" digital flexible endoscopes have revolutionized the visualization capabilities of indirect laryngoscopy and allow stroboscopy to be performed with near comparable clarity to that achieved with a rigid endoscope. Newer developments in laryngeal imaging and mobile technology are on the horizon.\n [3]  This article describes an appropriate method by which a comprehensive dynamic voice evaluation is completed using flexible laryngoscopy.

Its primary function is to protect the lower airway by closing abruptly upon mechanical stimulation, thereby halting respiration and preventing the entry of foreign matter into the airway. Other functions of the larynx include the production of sound (phonation), coughing, the Valsalva maneuver, and control of ventilation, and acting as a sensory organ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vocal cords are composed of mucous membrane infoldings that stretch horizontally across the middle laryngeal cavity. They are attached anteriorly at the angle on the interior surface of the thyroid cartilage and project posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages on either side. The vestibular folds, or false vocal cords, are formed by the superior layer of infolded membrane; the vocal folds, or true vocal cords, are formed from the inferior layer of infolded membrane.

Rarely, other objects have been reported (eg, teeth, hardened concrete sediments, illicit drugs, plant material).\n [2] ,\n [3] ,\n [4] Some persons from Mexico and Central America reportedly insert leaves and other plant material into their ears as a form of native remedy.\n [5] Also, some adults with psychiatric disorders present to the emergency department with foreign bodies lodged in their ears as a form of self-mutilation called ear stuffing.\n [6] \nIn children, the range of foreign bodies is extensive. Food particles (eg, candy, vegetable matter, beans, chewing gum) and other organic material (eg, leaves, flowers, cotton pieces) are commonly encountered.\n [7] Inorganic objects such as small toys, beads, pencil erasers, and rocks are also common. \n\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe ear is composed of external, middle (tympanic) (malleus, incus, and stapes), and inner (labyrinth) (semicircular canals, vestibule, cochlea) portions. The auricle and external acoustic meatus (or external auditory canal) compose the external ear. The external ear functions to collect and amplify sound, which then gets transmitted to the middle ear. The tympanic cavity (middle ear) extends from the tympanic membrane to the oval window and contains the bony conduction elements of the malleus, incus, and stapes. The primary functionality of the middle ear is that of bony conduction of sound via transference of sound waves in the air collected by the auricle to the fluid of the inner ear. The inner ear, also called the labyrinthine cavity, is essentially formed of the membranous labyrinth encased in the bony osseus labyrinth.

        "Ear Tube Insertion": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nEar tube insertion, also known as tympanostomy tube insertion, is the placement of a pressure equalizer tube into the tympanic membrane (see the image below).\n [1, 2] This surgical procedure treats middle ear fluid, which, when it persists in the middle ear space, can cause otitis media (acute or chronic) in addition to hearing loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEar tube in position in eardrum. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nThe first plastic ventilation tube was introduced by Beverley Armstrong in 1954, during the advent of the antibiotic era; a variant of this tube is still used today.\n [3] The plastic grommet was fashioned to remain within the tympanic membrane and prevent the quick closure of a myringotomy incision. Grommets are small and well tolerated by the tympanic membrane, and they can maintain a ventilatory port for the middle ear space for approximately 1-2 years.\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, ear tube insertion is the most frequently performed otologic surgical procedure in children. Various different sizes and shapes of ear tubes are available, selected by the surgeon on the basis of the underlying pathophysiology, the tube's specific characteristics, the number of previous sets of tubes, and the surgeon's preference. Alternatives to ear tube insertion are myringotomy and tympanocentesis.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe ear is composed of external, middle (tympanic) (malleus, incus, and stapes), and inner (labyrinth) (semicircular canals, vestibule, cochlea) portions. The auricle and external acoustic meatus (or external auditory canal) compose the external ear. The external ear functions to collect and amplify sound, which then gets transmitted to the middle ear. The tympanic cavity (middle ear) extends from the tympanic membrane to the oval window and contains the bony conduction elements of the malleus, incus, and stapes. The primary functionality of the middle ear is that of bony conduction of sound via transference of sound waves in the air collected by the auricle to the fluid of the inner ear. The inner ear, also called the labyrinthine cavity, is essentially formed of the membranous labyrinth encased in the bony osseus labyrinth. The labyrinthine cavity functions to conduct sound to the central nervous system as well as to assist in balance.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nThe most common indication for ear tube insertion remains persistent (> 3 mo) otitis media with effusion (OME), or serous otitis media (SOM), that does not resolve after 3 months of clinical observation or does not improve with antibiotic therapy.\n [4] A clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation states clinicians should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old.\n [5] Ear tube insertion promotes drainage of middle ear fluid, which can cause speech and language delay if left untreated for a prolonged period. Middle ear fluid also predisposes to recurrent infections.\n\nAnother indication for ear tube insertion is acute otitis media (AOM) that is refractory to antibiotic therapy. In persons who do not tolerate antibiotic therapy well, ear tube insertion allows egress of middle ear fluid (purulent, serous, mucoid) and permits easy delivery of topical antibiotic drops to the middle ear space.\n\nAdditional indications for prompt ear tube insertion include complications of AOM, such as meningitis, facial nerve palsy, and otomastoiditis. In patients with these complications, ear tubes can help halt tympanic membrane injury (eg, from retraction pockets, which distort the eardrum, and the subtle process of adhesive otitis media, which limits ossicular vibrations and can lead to permanent hearing loss). Prompt insertion of tympanostomy tubes ventilates the middle ear space and prevents further retraction of an eardrum under the negative pressure.\n\nExpected Outcomes\nOverall, 80% of children requiring ear tubes need 1 set of ear tubes. In children with ear tubes, episodes of otitis media are less frequent and are more readily treated with antibiotic ear drops.\n\nParadise's long-term study of a small cohort of children with OME did not show an overall improvement with respect to developmental outcomes in children who received tubes more promptly at age 3 years, regardless of baseline hearing.\n [6] However, this study did not examine individual improvements or improvements within more handicapped populations.\n\nIn contrast, Maw et al showed a small benefit in language development in children with bilateral OME and hearing loss.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Electronystagmography": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nElectronystagmography (ENG) is a study used to clinically evaluate patients with dizziness, vertigo, or balance dysfunction. ENG provides an objective assessment of the oculomotor and vestibular systems.\n [1, 2] \n\n\nThe vestibular system monitors the position and movements of the head to stabilize retinal images. This information is integrated with the visual system and spinal afferents in the brain stem to produce the vestibuloocular reflex.\n [3] \nEssentially, the standard ENG test battery consists of the following 3 parts:\n\n\n\n\n\nOculomotor evaluation\n\n\n\n\nPositioning/positional testing\n\n\n\n\nCaloric stimulation of the vestibular system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nAlthough ENG is the most widely used clinical laboratory test to assess vestibular function, normal ENG test results do not necessarily mean that a patient has typical vestibular function. ENG abnormalities can be useful in the diagnosis and localization of site of a lesion. However, many abnormalities are nonlocalizing; therefore, the clinical history and otologic examination of the patient are vital in formulating a diagnosis and treatment plan for a patient who presents with dizziness or vertigo.\n\nAlthough ENG testing cannot be used to determine the specific site of lesion, the information acquired can be integrated with history, symptoms, and other test results to aid in diagnosis. Comparing results obtained from various subtests of an ENG evaluation assists in determining whether a disorder is central or peripheral. In peripheral vestibular disorders, the side of lesion can be inferred from the results of caloric stimulation and, to some degree, from positional findings. An ENG evaluation can also be useful in ruling out potential causes of dizziness.\n\nIn a large study of patients tested with ENG in a wide range of clinical settings, Stockwell\n [4] found abnormal test results in approximately 39% of patients tested, and only about 29% of test results revealed the site of lesion. Peripheral vestibular abnormalities were found in approximately 23%, whereas central abnormalities were found in only approximately 5% of patients tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Endolymphatic Shunt Placement": "\nBackground\n\n\nEndolymphatic sac (ES) shunt surgery is a treatment for medically refractory disabling vertigo in Meniere disease, which is an inner ear disorder that features the symptomatic tetrad of episodic vertigo, aural fullness, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus.\nThe pathologic correlate to Meniere disease is endolymphatic hydrops, a dilation of the endolymphatic compartment of the inner ear, both in the cochlea and vestibule.\n [1, 2] This suggests an accumulation of endolymph. It is unknown whether the accumulation of endolymph results from overproduction or underresorption of endolymph. The precise etiology of Meniere disease is still unknown, even after a century and a half since Prosper Ménière first described the syndrome.\n [3] \n\n\nEndolymph is produced by the stria vascularis and flows toward the endolymphatic sac, where it is resorbed. The endolymphatic sac has been the center of attention for the treatment of Meniere disease. If Meniere disease is related to an excessive accumulation of endolymph, the basis for endolymphatic sac surgery would be to surgically release the endolymphatic sac from its bony and dural confines to relieve the pressure via decompression or to incise the sac to drain the endolymph via shunting.\nSurgery on the endolymphatic sac for the control of vertigo dates back to 1927, when it was performed by Georges Portmann.\n [4] He believed that Meniere syndrome resulted from overpressure of the endolymphatic fluid due to either an endolabyrinthine or extralabyrinthine cause. He used the term “aural glaucoma” to describe the situation in the inner ear. In his procedural descriptions, he simply incised the endolymphatic sac and allowed the clear endolymphatic fluid to drain. In this manner, he successfully treated numerous patients with vertigo.\n\n\n\n\nThe endolymphatic sac’s role in Meniere disease was more convincing after surgical obliteration or occlusion of the endolymphatic duct and sac led to a histologic endolymphatic hydrops in animal studies.\n [5, 6] Surgeries either to surgically open the endolymphatic sac and stent the lumen of the sac open with a shunt or to simply decompress the sac were performed with successful control of vertigo in Meniere disease.\n\n\n\n\nStudies have demonstrated endolymphatic sac shunting to be effective in control of the vertigo in Meniere disease in 50%–75% of patients.\n [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] In fact, it appears that endolymphatic sac decompression is as effective as endolymphatic sac shunting for control of vertigo.\n [13, 14, 15, 16] \n\nThe precise mechanism by which endolymphatic sac surgery helps to control the vertigo is unknown. However, endolymphatic sac surgery stands as the only surgical nonablative option for the treatment of Meniere disease. Thus, hearing can be preserved with such an operation, in contradistinction to the ablative surgical options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Endoscopic Management of Facial Fractures": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe basic tenets of facial fracture repair include fracture exposure, reduction, and fixation. Traditionally, these repairs have been performed via an open surgical approach. In fact, in recent decades, increasingly wider exposures have been used to ensure accurate =bony repositioning. However, recent experiences have suggested that the use of endoscopes, as in other minimally invasive procedures, may allow repair of facial fractures through smaller incisions with less-extensive exposure.\nBecause of the lower morbidity rates associated with smaller incisions and exposures, minimally invasive surgical techniques have been rapidly accepted. Endoscopic sinus surgery was described in the 1970s and became the standard of care in the 1980s. Since then, the indications for endoscopic head and neck surgery have continued to expand, with applications in otology (middle ear endoscopy), skull base surgery (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] leak management, optic nerve decompression, tumor resection), neck surgery (thyroid and parathyroid), and ophthalmologic surgery (dacryocystorhinostomy).\n\n\nIn facial plastic surgery, endoscopy was initially used for forehead rejuvenation.\n [1, 2] Now, endoscopic browlifts have, for the most part, replaced traditional open approaches, and many surgeons now use endoscopic techniques for midface rejuvenation. Early applications for endoscopic treatment of facial trauma include subcondylar fractures of the mandible,\n [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] orbital blow-out fractures (OBFs),\n [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] frontal sinus fractures,\n [14, 15, 16, 17] and zygomatic fractures.\n [18, 19] \nAn illustration detailing the incisions for endoscopic repair of anterior table frontal sinus fractures can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of incisions used for endoscopic repair of anterior table frontal sinus fractures.

        "Epiglottic Reconstruction": "\nBackground\n\n\nEpiglottis reconstruction is mainly and most commonly performed to prevent abnormal swallowing and aspiration.\n [1, 2] \nMalignancies of the head and neck can result in devastating functional and cosmetic deficits that have a significant psychosocial impact on affected patients. In most cases, the ramifications of undergoing treatment for head and neck cancers extend far beyond the psychological and social aspects. Aside from cosmetic deformities of the head and neck, these patients may also develop deficits in their abilities to speak, eat, swallow, and even breathe.\n\n\nThe incidence of head and neck cancers, and thus the need for treatment, has slowly increased,\n [3] as has the burden of posttreatment management. The morbidity associated with head and neck malignancies has necessitated the evolution of operative techniques and ushered in an era of innovative conservation surgeries and reconstructive procedures in the field of plastic surgery.\nAlthough the 20th century saw substantial progress in the area of head and neck reconstruction, the first plastic surgery dates as far back as 3000 BC, when the first rhinoplasty in the management of facial trauma was described.\n [1, 4] Since then, the field of reconstructive surgery has made remarkable gains with the use of revascularized flaps, free flaps with autologous skin transplants, pedicled myocutaneous flaps, and osteocutaneous free flaps in reconstructing defects.\n [5, 6, 7, 8] \n\n\n\n\nThese historical landmarks have paved the way for current techniques in epiglottis reconstruction. The review of these techniques first begins with a discussion of the function of the epiglottis.\n\n\n\n\nThe epiglottis is an elastic leaf-shaped cartilage that covers the entrance to the larynx. It is important in preventing aspiration of solids and liquids. A competent and functional epiglottis is essential for normal eating and swallowing.\n [9, 10] Dysfunction of the epiglottis can lead to complications such as chronic aspiration, which, in turn, can cause significant pulmonary damage.\n [11, 12] Epiglottis dysfunction has multiple etiologies, but, in the field of reconstructive surgery, these dysfunctions typically result from anatomic deficits of the epiglottis, such as after supraglottic (horizontal) laryngectomy.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nDuring embryologic development, the supraglottic structures (epiglottis, arytenoid cartilages, false vocal folds, ventricle) derive from the buccopharyngeal primordium, which arises from the third and fourth branchial arches. In contrast, the glottis and subglottis are derived from the tracheobronchial primordium of the sixth branchial arch.\n [11] Because the supraglottis is not embryologically linked to the glottis and subglottis, it derives its blood supply from the superior laryngeal arteries. The lymphatics of the supraglottis travel along the superior laryngeal vessels to the carotid sheath and drain bilaterally into the deep cervical chain nodes in levels II and III of the neck.\n\nThe epiglottis is considered to be part of the “supraglottis,” which also includes the arytenoid cartilages, false vocal folds, and ventricle. The epiglottis is divided into the suprahyoid epiglottis (lingual and laryngeal surfaces) and the infrahyoid epiglottis. At its most inferior aspect (petiole), the epiglottis is attached to the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage laminae above the anterior commissure and projects posteriorly into the pharynx. Laterally, it is attached to the quadrangular membrane, an accessory elastic structure that provides support to the supraglottic structures. Along with the thyroepiglottic ligament, the anterior surface of the epiglottic cartilage forms the posterior boundary of the pre-epiglottic space (see images below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaryngoscopic view of the larynx.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve provides motor innervation to all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid muscle) and sensory innervation to the glottis, subglottis, and trachea (see images below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nempty para to satisfy content model\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nempty para to satisfy content model\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nNo standardized method has been established for reconstruction of the epiglottis; thus, this article is an overview of the various techniques that have been described in the literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Excision of Mouth Lesions": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nA wide range of disorders can lead to mucosal changes in the oral cavity. Typically, lesions arise from processes that are infectious or inflammatory and that respond to medical therapy. Not infrequently, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases may affect the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity or its contents. The latter changes often require tissue biopsy for clinical pathology review before initiation of therapy.\n\n\nThe initial history of the clinical presentation is most critical to formulating a differential diagnosis of potential disease processes. Important historical points to elicit include the time of onset of symptoms, the presence or absence of pain, dietary intake, and visible lesions of the face, lips, tongue, or mucosal membranes. Clinicians must also ask about the presence of any associated systemic symptoms, such as fever or weight loss, and history of prior neoplasm or malignancy. Other critical elements of the history include exposure to medications, alcohol, tobacco, chemicals, recent oral trauma or dental work, and vaccination history. Patients with HIV or other immunocompromised states, such as leukemia or neutropenia, can have opportunistic pathogens affecting mucosa. Most commonly, these are invasive fungal infections, which are not seen in otherwise healthy patients.\nMost oral lesions are adequately diagnosed based on a detailed history and thorough physical examination alone and can be treated accordingly. A detailed head and neck examination should be performed, with particular emphasis on the oral cavity and oropharyngeal examination. Palpation of the face, cheeks, floor of mouth, and neck reveals any localized areas of induration, tenderness, or cysts.\n\n\n\n\nThe appearance of any lesions should be documented in detail (dimension, location, color) and followed closely over the following days or perhaps, weeks. However, lesions that persist despite adequate treatment or raise concerns for neoplasm should undergo excisional biopsy promptly. Any associated changes in symptoms (such as weight loss, rash, discoloration of the overlying skin) should be noted in a complete review of systems. Radiological imaging is essential for large lesions and may be reserved for lesions with either extensive involvement or critical proximity to vital structures.\n\n\n\n\nA video depicting the excision of mouth lesions can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOral mass excision. \n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe oral cavity represents the first part of the digestive tube. It includes the lips, gingivae, retromolar trigone, teeth, hard palate, cheek mucosa, mobile tongue, and floor of the mouth. The major salivary glands are in close relation with oral cavity structures, although they are not part of the oral cavity. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Mouth Anatomy and Tongue Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nThe most common indication for the excision of an oral cavity lesion is to obtain tissue for diagnosis. Most commonly the lesions are benign and reflect congenital or acquired injuries or structures. Prompt biopsy is especially important when trying to confirm a possible soft tissue sarcoma or other neoplastic malignancy. Benign lesions, such as large mucocele, lymphangioma, or enlarging cysts, which are disrupting normal function or causing significant discomfort, may also warrant excision.\n\nContraindications\nExcision of oral cavity lesions has few contraindications but must be planned carefully to assure high functional and cosmetic outcomes. Patients who are on medications and may be anticoagulated or with underlying bleeding disorders should undergo medical clearance prior to any major procedure. A hematologist may be consulted for management considerations. Depending on the type and severity of the coagulation disorder, patients may require pretreatment with blood products, such as transfusion of platelets or coagulation factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Exploratory Tympanotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nExploratory tympanotomy refers to the surgical approach to the middle ear and its structures for diagnosis. The steps of exploratory tympanotomy are the same as those that would precede transcanal middle ear surgery, such as stapedectomy or removal of a small glomus tympanicum tumor. The operation is performed under otomicroscopy across the external auditory canal (transcanal). Canal skin incisions are created that permit tympanic membrane elevation to gain the necessary exposure to the middle ear and the structures contained within.\nExploratory tympanotomy takes its origins from early fenestration surgeries performed by Sourdille\n [1] and Lempert\n [2] for otosclerosis. Rosen performed the same exploratory tympanotomy steps prior to stapes mobilization.\n [3] It was simply a means to access the middle ear and its structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Facial Nerve Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nThis article describes facial nerve repair for facial paralysis. Paralysis of the facial nerve is a cause of significant functional and aesthetic compromise.\n [1] Functional concerns primarily involve adequate protection of the eye, with a real risk of exposure keratitis if not properly addressed. In addition, swallowing, drooling, and speech difficulties may arise.\nThe degree of suffering these patients feel, however, is often far greater than these functional problems alone would produce. Patients with facial paralysis, especially younger ones, may experience tremendous psychosocial distress about their condition. Poor self-image and difficulty interacting with peers and family members can be devastating.\n\n\nRepair of the facial nerve is generally a concern in cases of permanent complete facial paralysis. This may involve all or selected branches of the facial nerve.\nFacial paralysis has many causes, which may be conveniently divided into the following 5 categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nCongenital\n\n\n\n\nIdiopathic\n\n\n\n\nTraumatic\n\n\n\n\nNeoplastic\n\n\n\n\nInflammatory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongenital facial paralysis, as in the well-described although poorly understood Möbius syndrome, is uncommon.\n\nIdiopathic facial paralysis (Bell palsy) is the most common type. It is often thought to be due to virally induced inflammation of the nerve that results in functional compromise, swelling, and vascular compromise. Facial nerve repair is infrequently required, because most of these patients regain function spontaneously. When paralysis is permanent, some advocate facial nerve decompression in selected cases. This article focuses on cases requiring various nerve grafting techniques, rather than procedures of decompression.\n\nTraumatic facial paralysis (from blunt and penetrating trauma or intraoperative iatrogenic injury) is the next most common type. The site of facial nerve injury may be intracranial, intratemporal, or external to the stylomastoid foramen. Acoustic neuroma surgery is an example of a procedure that puts the facial nerve at risk (in the cerebellopontine angle, in this case). Any injury sites may be amenable to facial nerve repair, except for sites near the nerve’s root entry zone, where the available facial nerve stump may not be long enough to allow repair.\n\nNeoplastic causes of facial paralysis include tumors of the parotid gland, typically malignant. Facial nerve schwannomas, acoustic neuromas, and neoplasms of the brain are among the less common causes of facial paralysis.\n\nInflammatory and infectious causes of facial paralysis can occur. Infectious agents implicated include virally mediated conditions such as herpes zoster (eg, Ramsey Hunt syndrome), mumps, Coxsackie virus, and mononucleosis. Bacterial infections include sequelae of otitis media and Lyme disease. Inflammatory causes of facial paralysis include sarcoidosis.\n\nThe etiology of the facial paralysis determines the likelihood of spontaneous return of function, as in most cases of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell palsy). The transected or severely damaged nerve must be repaired if satisfactory return of function is to be achieved. The problem remains a frustrating one because residual weakness and synkinesis are inevitable components of the healing process. Nonetheless, most patients benefit greatly from modern techniques of repair.\n [2, 3] \n\nToday, several different procedures are available for repair of the facial nerve, including direct repair, cable nerve grafting, and nerve crossover techniques. Facial nerve decompression for cases of intact but damaged nerves and procedures of facial reanimation distinct from the repair of the facial nerve are discussed elsewhere (see Dynamic Reanimation for Facial Paralysis).\n [4, 5] \n\nActive research continues to find ways to improve the results of treating facial nerve injuries. These include advances in the molecular biology of nerve regeneration and improved techniques of repair. A variety of neurotrophic and neurotropic factors have been investigated for their effects on the facial nerve. In addition, humoral factors have been identified as having a role in facial nerve regeneration.\n\nNewer techniques proposed as possible alternatives to suture repair include laser neurorrhaphy and tissue adhesive repair. Synthetic and biologic tubules have been created to provide a path for the regenerating axons, even spanning small gaps in the nerve. Although these have not been clearly shown to be superior to standard nerve grafting techniques, they remain important areas of investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Fiberoptic Nasopharyngoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nFiberoptic imaging was initially developed in the 1930s by a medical student named Heinrich Lamm. Lamm intended to visualize inaccessible regions of the body with his invention. Fiberoptic imaging became more visible in medical literature during the 1950s with further innovations by Hopkins and Storz.\n [1] By 1963, Hirschowitz designed a medically functional fiberoptic scope with higher resolution, lighting, suction, and instrument ports.\n [2] Current fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopes are lighted, are flexible with 2-way articulation, provide inline viewing with photo and video capabilities, and can have a distal diameter as small as 2 mm. \nAlternative visualization techniques include indirect laryngoscopy and laryngoscopy by angled telescope.\n [3] The traditional indirect laryngoscopy relies on a single hand-held mirror to reflect the structures of the larynx to sight. Laryngoscopy by angled telescope allows a direct view of these structures also. Though these techniques may be less expensive and easier to use initially, fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy (for the purposes of simplicity, indirect fiberoptic laryngoscopy is included under this heading) provides clearer visualization and better access to nasopharyngeal anatomy. The image below depicts an adult fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdult fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope with 4-mm distal diameter, 2-way articulation, and video-recording capabilities. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nFiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy can allow visualization of the following structures: nasal cavity, septum, middle meatal space and infundibulum, frontal recess, sphenoid ethmoid recess, turbinates, posterior choanae, eustachian tube orifices, adenoids, nasopharynx, posterior surface of the uvula and palate, velopharyngeal valve, adenoids, base of the tongue, pharyngeal and lingual tonsils, vallecula, pyriform spaces, epiglottis/supraglottis, glottis with mobility or immobility of the vocal folds and arytenoids, and immediate subglottis. \n\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe pharynx is a fibromuscular tube that is semicircular in cross section and is situated directly anterior to the vertebral column. It extends from the skull base to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. Six muscles are predominantly responsible for the voluntary actions of the pharynx: three pharyngeal constrictor muscles that are roughly circularly layered on top of one another and three vertically oriented muscles (stylopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus, and palatopharyngeus). \n\n\n\n\nThe pharynx serves as a continuation of the digestive cavity, providing a route from the oral cavity proper to the esophagus. In addition, the pharynx communicates with the nasal cavity, the middle ear cavity, and the larynx. The pharynx is often described from an exterior view and an interior perspective. Based on the location, the interior of the pharynx is often separated into three sections—the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. \n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Pharynx Anatomy and Throat Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Fine-Needle Aspiration of Neck Masses": "\nOverview\n\n\nClinical evaluation of a solitary neck mass can be difficult because of the extensive differential diagnoses (listed below). In certain infections and neoplasms, open biopsy can lead to complications in further treatment once the etiology of the neck mass is determined. Thoughtful evaluation of the workup of a neck mass is of utmost importance, and fine needle aspiration (FNA) can often provide a timely diagnosis with less morbidity to the patient and decreased cost compared to open biopsy.\nWhen evaluating a patient with a solitary neck mass, age of the patient is an important factor in determining the differential diagnoses. Individuals younger than 40 years are overwhelmingly diagnosed with benign processes such as congenital and inflammatory lesions. In patients older than 40 years, the differential diagnoses shift, as more than 60% of lesions are associated with malignancy. \n\n\nIn the era of increasing incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (OPHNSCC), clinicians should not exclude the possibility of malignancy in non-smoker/non-drinker patients.\n [1]  The incidence of HPV-positive OPHNSCC has more than doubled\n [2, 3]  with a rate rising so rapidly that HPV-positive OPHNSCC is estimated to exceed the incidence of HPV-positive uterine cervical cancer by 2020.\n [3, 4]  Often these patients present with the sole symptom of neck mass that on imaging can appear cystic and be mistaken for a branchial cleft cyst resulting in delayed diagnosis. For patients with HNSCC, a delay of just 2 months has been associated with worse functional outcomes, lower quality of life, and cancer recurrence.\n [5, 6, 7]  In adult patients, a cystic neck mass should not be presumed to be benign disease, and therefore evaluation with FNA and/or additional imaging studies should be pursued until a diagnosis is obtained.\n [1] \nDifferential diagnoses of neck masses\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nMetastatic\n\n\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC)\n\nAdenocarcinoma (most commonly from salivary gland origin)\n\nAll other primary sites imaginable have been reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary neck tumors\n\n\n\nThyroid\n\nLymphoma\n\nSalivary gland neoplasia\n\nParaganglioma\n\n\n\n\n\nCongenital\n\n\n\nThyroglossal duct cyst\n\nBranchial cleft cyst\n\nHemangioma\n\nDermoid cyst\n\nEctopic thyroid\n\nThymic cyst\n\n\n\n\n\nInflammatory\n\n\n\nLymphadenopathy (may be viral or bacterial)\n\nSarcoid\n\nTuberculosis\n\nCat scratch\n\nSialadenitis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee 10 Patients with Neck Masses: Identifying Malignant versus Benign, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify several types of masses.\n\nEvaluation of a patient with a neck mass should always begin with a thorough history, followed by a complete head and neck examination. Associated symptoms that should alert the clinician for malignancy include hoarseness, otalgia, unilateral hearing loss, hemoptysis, weight loss, dysphagia, and odynophagia. A history of fever, night sweats, and weight loss may suggest lymphoma. Physical exam findings of overlying skin ulceration, firmness, or size greater than 1.5 cm are physical exam findings more suggestive of malignancy.\n [1, 8] \n\nIf the history and physical examination do not explain the neck mass, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the neck mass may be performed. The results of the FNA may allow the physician to focus further testing. For instance, if the mass is found to be a metastatic squamous carcinoma, a thorough examination of the upper aerodigestive tract is warranted. Additionally, imaging is recommended prior to FNA if there is a suspected vascular lesion (palpable thrill or auscultation of bruit on physical exam).\n\nFNA for cytologic evaluation of a neck mass was first reported by Kun in 1847. The procedure did not gain wide acceptance in medicine at that time, but in the 1930s, Memorial Sloan Kettering rediscovered the utility of needle biopsy for evaluation of head and neck masses. At that time, use of large-bore needles led to frequent complications, one of which was occasional seeding of the tumor along the biopsy tract.\n [9, 10] The frequent morbidity associated with this procedure prevented widespread acceptance of this technique in other centers in America. In the 1970s, Swedish physicians demonstrated excellent results in cytologic examination of metastatic neck lesions with the use of FNA leading to a resurgence of this technique.\n [11]  Since then, FNA of solitary neck masses has become a well-accepted, safe, and cost-effective procedure in the diagnosis of neck masses.\n\nFNA allows the pathologist to see the cells aspirated from the lesion. In contrast to large bore needle biopsy techniques, FNA does not allow evaluation of cell morphology. In some instances, aspirated cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry or with immunologic markers. In every circumstance, FNA is a test and should be interpreted with the entire clinical circumstances. False-negative and false-positive FNA results are reported in almost every series. Therefore, reliance upon FNA findings at the expense of clinical, radiographic, or other findings is unsafe.\n [12] \n\nAdvantages over open biopsy\nFNA has several advantages over open biopsy for both the physician and the patient. FNA can be performed with or without image guidance. Image-guided tissue sampling can be performed with ultrasound or CT. FNA can be performed quickly and with minimal setup time, even with ultrasound guidance. CT-guided FNA is more time consuming, but can be useful for deep targets (masticator space, deep lobe of parotid, pterygopalatine fossa). CT-guided FNA may require evaluation of renal function if intravenous contrast dye is used. Ultrasound-guided FNA also may be more advantageous in the pediatric population where concern for ionizing radiation exposure is higher. The American Thyroid Association recommends ultrasound guidance for FNA of nodules with higher liklihood of nondiagnostic cytology ( >25–50% cystic component) or sampling error (difficult to palpate).\n [13] \n\nFNA is more convenient for patients and their families compared to open biopsy. The procedure requires only an office visit with minimal loss of time from work. On the other hand, excisional biopsy often requires time off from work, preoperative blood tests, and often, radiographic and cardiac testing. Furthermore, surgery exposes patients to the risks of anesthesia, postoperative infection, and the possibility of tumor seeding (see below). A percentage of patients may require overnight admission to the hospital and extra time away from work.\n\nOpen biopsy may interfere with further treatment. Incorrectly placed biopsy incisions may make subsequent neck dissection or excision difficult. In 1991, Birchall and colleagues demonstrated that 6 of 10 patients undergoing excisional biopsy of masses experienced complications in relation to the biopsy.\n [14] These complications included compromise of later tumor resection, the necessity for excision of extra skin and adjacent soft tissue, and local recurrence in the neck wound after surgery.\n\nIn today's economic environment, cost savings is an important consideration in medicine. The cost of FNA in the office varies from $75 to $350 depending on the study source and whether or not the pathology fees are included. In contrast, the cost of an excisional biopsy ranges from $1200 to $2500. The cost is even higher if a hospital stay is required.\n\nLimitations of fine-needle aspiration\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) for head and neck masses has several limitations. Failure to establish an accurate diagnosis may be because of sampling error. In these circumstances, repeat aspiration is suggested, and excisional biopsy may be considered. Personnel responsible for handling, processing (experienced cytotechnologist), and reading (cytopathologist) FNA samples must be well trained. Interobserver variability must be minimized. The accuracy of FNA varies with report and according to the tissues sampled (see specific examples below).\n\nThe diagnostic accuracy following aspiration of a cystic mass may be especially suspect because of the potential to aspirate acellular material.\n [15]  In fact, the sensitivity of FNA is lower in cystic cervical neck masses compared to solid neck masses (73% and 90% respectively).\n [16, 17]  Good evidence currently suggests that the best results are achieved when FNA is accomplished using ultrasonographic or CT guidance to improve sampling accuracy.\n [18]  Either modality allows more precise localization of lesions and may facilitate more accurate positioning of the needle to aspirate the capsule in lesions with central necrosis. Accuracy is further enhanced by including a cytologist at the chairside to stain and preview the slides before the procedure is terminated. This also offers the potential to obtain extra material for flow cytometry when a lymphoma is suspected.\n\nIf any questions exist regarding interpretation of the aspirate, decisions on further therapy (eg, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) should be deferred until the mass is accurately diagnosed. Finally, using FNA under the appropriate conditions is important. FNA complements clinical diagnosis and should not be considered a substitute for a thorough history and physical examination.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe neck is the part of the body that separates the head from the torso. The Latin-derived term cervical means \"of the neck.\" The neck supports the weight of the head and is highly flexible, allowing the head to turn and flex in different directions.\n\nThe midline in front of the neck has a prominence of the thyroid cartilage termed the laryngeal prominence, or the so-called \"Adam's apple.\" Between the Adam’s apple and the chin, the hyoid bone can be felt; below the thyroid cartilage, a further ring that can be felt in the midline is the cricoid cartilage. Between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch, the trachea and isthmus of the thyroid gland can be felt.\n\nThe quadrangular area is on the side of the neck and is bounded superiorly by the lower border of the body of the mandible and the mastoid process, inferiorly by the clavicle, anteriorly by a midline in front of the neck, and posteriorly by the trapezius muscle.\n\nThe image below depicts the anterior cervical muscles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnterior cervical muscles. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Neck Anatomy.\n\nGeneral results of fine-needle aspiration\nInterest in the use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in the diagnosis of neck masses has increased. Scandinavian success with FNA has been replicated by several large American studies for the head and neck. In 1982, Frable and Frable reviewed the success of FNA in 567 patients with neck masses.\n [19] Since then, multiple reports of experience with FNA in the diagnosis of head and neck lesions have been published. Sensitivity and specificity rates are approximately 85-90%. This means the incidence of false-negative and false-positive results range from 10-15%. FNA is not a substitute for excisional biopsy but should be considered an additional diagnostic tool to be used concurrently with patient history, physical findings, and laboratory tests.\n\nFine-needle aspiration in pediatric patients\nNeck masses in children differ from those in adults. Children are far more likely than adults to have reactive lymphadenopathy. Primary or secondary malignant involvement is rare in children.\n\nUnfortunately, the literature on FNA in children is limited by small study size and varying results. Stevens et al report a meta-analysis of FNA biopsy in pediatric thyroid nodules.\n [20] They conclude it is a sensitive test and useful for excluding malignancy. A recent small study of 18 pediatric patients with cervical lymphadenopathy found FNA biopsy to have 100% sensitivity, 93% positive predictive value, and 94.5% accuracy for distinguishing malignancy from benign lymphadenopathy.\n [21] \n\nFNA for evaluation of neoplastic etiology of neck mass \nAlthough fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may not be the method of choice for all neck masses, studies demonstrate a specific advantage of FNA for the diagnosis of several specific disease entities. FNA is useful for the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and lymphoma. FNA showed an overall accuracy rate of 93.1% (range, 73.3%–98.0%), overall sensitivity of 89.6%; specificity, 96.5%; positive predictive value, 96.2%; and negative predictive value, 90.3%. Of the anatomic subsites within the head and neck, thyroid and salivary gland location had lower sensitivity (81.1% and 82.5%, respectively) and lymph node FNA had a higher sensitivity (92.5%).\n [22] \n\nMetastatic squamous cell carcinoma\n\nIn a study of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the neck subsequently treated by neck dissection, Knappe et al\n [23] found that ultrasound-guided FNA had a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 98%, and accuracy of 94%. In the event of the unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, the predictive power of FNA allows physicians to narrow the search for the primary tumor. Furthermore, FNA can be a powerful tool for diagnosing cervical recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas without the financial costs and the morbidity of excisional biopsy. \n\nFNA biopsy for diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma may have lower sensitivity in the event of a cystic mass or previous neck irradiation. Chan and Chan note that in patients who previously received radiation, the sensitivity of FNA was only 40%, compared with 82% in patients without prior neck irradiation.\n [24]  Gourin and Johnson report FNA results in 12 patients with cystic metastasis. False-negative aspirates were encountered in 5 (42%) patients.\n [15]  In each case, the diagnosis was made by excisional biopsy. The presence of a thick-walled cyst should raise clinical concern for this entity.\n\nMore recently, FNA has been useful for detection of squamous cell carcinoma related to human papillomavirus (HPV). In a review of 70 patients who underwent FNA for squamous cell carcinoma, two thirds of the FNA specimens contained adequate DNA for molecular detection of HPV-related disease.\n [25]  The College of American Pathologists (CAP) recommend high-risk HPV staining be performed on all patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and p16 can be used as a surrogate marker. Interpretation of p16 staining has been controversial, although the accepted definition of a positive result is >70% cytoplasmic and nuclear staining.\n [26]  There are no well-established guidelines for p16 positivity from FNA/cell blocks. Reported positive results range from 10% to 50% with some authors citing that at least 15% positivity is needed, a number that correlates with high-risk HPV RNA in situ.\n [26, 27, 28, 29]  Other studies stress that p16 positivity only be evaluated in viable tumor cells.\n [26] \n\nOther markers identified on ancillary testing may be of use when analyzing FNA samples. Although evidence for prognostic utility of program death  ligand 1(PD-L1) expression in HNSCC is unclear at this time, it has been shown to be of prognostic utility in certain lung malignancies.55 Evaluation of FNA aspirates for PD-L1 expression showed high concordance with open biopsy and core biopsy specimens.\n [30, 31]  \n\nThyroid Carcinoma\n\nThe prevalence of thyroid nodules detectable by ultrasound may approach 60–70% in the population.\n [32, 33, 34] Incidence varies by age and method of detection. Incidence of carcinoma in thyroid nodules is less than 10% in most populations. Many studies have examined the use of FNA in the diagnosis of masses suspicious for thyroid malignancies. A study of FNA biopsy in nearly 2000 patients at the Mayo Clinic showed a 97% positive predictive value and a 92% negative predictive value for malignancy.\n [34] Other reports support these data.\n [32, 35] While thyroid nodules larger than 4 cm are more likely to be malignant,\n [33] it is unclear whether FNA is less accurate for nodules of this size. A large study in more than 1000 patients showed no difference in sensitivity, specificity, or positive predictive value of FNA for nodules larger than 4 cm compared with those smaller than 4 cm; negative predictive value was improved for nodules larger than 4 cm.\n [36] \n\nWhile papillary thyroid carcinoma can often be diagnosed with FNA based on classic cytologic features,\n [33] follicular adenoma is difficult or impossible to distinguish from follicular carcinoma in most aspirates. The difficulty in distinguishing benign from malignant has led to the term follicular neoplasm. Because of the difficulty in differentiating follicular adenoma from well-differentiated follicular carcinoma with FNA, the presence of a follicular neoplasm with FNA is an indication for thyroid surgery. Recent investigations report that the use of molecular markers such as BRAF, galectin-3, HBME-1, PAX-8-PPARγ, RAS, and RET/PRC are gaining increasing clinical usefulness.\n [37, 38, 33, 39, 40] \n\nLymphoma\n\nWhen cytologic evaluation suggests a lymphoid lesion, further study may be essential to rule out lymphoma. Although FNA is 98% specific for the absence of tumor and 95% sensitive for the presence of tumor in most neck masses, improper diagnosis may be encountered when trying to distinguish lymphoma from reactive lymphadenitis.The accurate cellular diagnosis of a specific lymphoma depends on changes in lymph node architecture, which requires morphologic examination of the entire node. However, when the previous cytoarchitecture of a lymphoma specimen is known, FNA is reliable in predicting recurrence.\n\nSome reports have suggested that Hodgkin lymphoma can be accurately diagnosed by FNA. Hodgkin lymphoma is suggested by the presence of Reed–Sternberg cells in the setting of numerous lymphocytes on FNA. The role of FNA in the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is controversial. The diagnostic yield of FNA is low because differentiating non-Hodgkin lymphoma from lymphocytic thyroiditis and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is difficult. Studies that combine FNA with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry may increase the accuracy of lymphoma diagnosis without the need for excisional biopsies. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines state that with regard to most NHL entities, FNA or core biopsy is insufficient for initial diagnosis due to lack of accurate histologic grading for entities such as follicular lymphoma.\n [41] \n\nFlow cytometry uses a beam of laser light to identify cell surface antigens. Tagged antibodies bind to cell surface antigens on lymphocytes, allowing the identification of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Recently, flow cytometry has been used to help diagnose pathology on FNA. In a 10-year study of more than 500 patients by Savage and colleagues, flow cytometry was performed on FNA specimens to differentiate lymphoma from reactive lymphadenopathy, with results compared to histologic diagnosis from excisional biopsy or to prolonged follow up. The authors noted that flow cytometry had an accuracy of 88.4%, sensitivity of 85.8%, and specificity of 92.9%.\n [42] \n\nSalivary gland carcinoma\n\nUse of FNA for isolated salivary gland masses is broadly accepted. Nevertheless, surgeons are cautioned to interpret the result of FNA within the context of the clinical situation. Salivary gland cytology is a known challenge due to frequent morphologic overlap between tumor types.\n [43]  Both false-negative and false-positive results are encountered. Interpretation of salivary gland pathology is difficult (the most common tumors are \"pleomorphic\" adenoma) and requires greater experience than the interpretation of some other neck masses.\n\nIn 2012, Tryggvason et al evaluated FNA biopsy in 543 patients with salivary gland masses, the majority involving the parotid gland, finding a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 99.5% for identification of the final histologic diagnosis following surgical resection.\n [44]  Positive predictive value for malignancy was more than 98%, while negative predictive value was 94.3%. In another 2012 study including 249 patients with parotid masses, FNA was found to be only 80% sensitive and 89.5% specific for the detection of malignancy.\n [45]   \n\nImmunohistochemical and genetic characterization of salivary gland neoplasms has increased, and ancillary testing may be quite useful in narrowing the differential in challenging cases. With the exception of special stains for microbiology, ancillary testing is not indicated in nonneoplastic salivary gland FNA results. If FNA is suspicious for a neoplastic process, ancillary testing may be useful for entities that have nonspecific or overlapping morphology.\n [43]  Immunohistochemistry, FISH, and sequence-based methods can be performed on cytologic materials. For example, 70% of pleomorphic adenomas have recurrent genetic alterations with the majority being translocation or intrachromosal rearrangements of the PLAG1 gene locus (50–60%) and HMAG2 gene locus(10–20%).\n [46, 47, 48, 49]  Mucoepidermoid carcinoma can present a diagnostic challenge depending on tumor grade and sampling error. Ancillary testing with molecular confirmation of the MAML2 gene rearrangement offers definitive diagnosis.\n [43] \n\nFNA alone may not be sufficient to rule out salivary malignancies and that further clinical evaluation, including surgical resection, may be necessary. Most reports acknowledge a low but important incidence of false-positive aspirates. When clinical suspicion warrants it, further sampling (eg, excisional biopsy) is appropriate.\n\nFNA for evaluation of neck mass from infectious etiology\nFNA is routinely used for the histologic diagnosis of isolated neoplastic neck masses. However, use of FNA in the diagnosis of inflammatory lesions has been limited. FNA could likely be used to isolate individual organisms or at least allow for the culture of an offending organism. An array of case reports and case series has demonstrated a use for FNA in the diagnosis of infectious diseases of the neck. A few of the causes identified include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis; Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Coccidioides, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter species; and Cytomegalovirus infection, syphilis, and actinomycosis.\n\nTuberculous lymphadenitis is a common extrapulmonary presentation that may manifest as a neck mass. FNA specimens have cytologic evidence consistent with tuberculosis, including granulomatous inflammation and/or caseation necrosis. Multiple studies have demonstrated greater than 90% accuracy in diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis with FNA.\n [50, 51, 52]  However, the positivity rate of mycobacterial culture from FNA reported in the literature ranges from 10% to 70%. Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on aspirate materials, specifically for the IS6110 sequence, is a a useful molecular  ancillary test used for diagnois of  tuberculosis lymphadenitis.\n [53, 54] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Fine-Needle Aspiration of the Salivary Glands": "\nOverview\n\n\nMajor salivary glands are easily accessible; therefore, they are optimal targets for fine-needle aspiration (FNA). This technique has been used for decades in Europe, but it is still controversial in the United States. The large numbers of benign and malignant tumors that can originate in the glands, as well as the lack of cytological markers to accurately diagnose the various tumors, often foster uncertainty in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosis of salivary gland masses. Therefore, the primary challenge of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is differentiating benign from malignant disease and then differentiating the various malignancies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Flexible Rhinoscopy": "\nBackground\n\n\nFlexible rhinoscopy is a quick, office-based procedure used to examine the entire nasal cavity.\nIt is most commonly performed by otolaryngologists in the evaluation of nasal obstruction, sinusitis, epistaxis, anosmia, other symptoms of rhinitis, and head and neck cancer. It can also be performed by allergists in the evaluation of allergic rhinitis and radiation oncologists to assess the response of malignancy to radiation therapy. Internal medicine, family medicine, and emergency medicine doctors may also use flexible rhinoscopy to evaluate patients with epistaxis or nasal foreign bodies.\n\n\nFlexible rhinoscopy is commonly performed in the office or at the bedside with no specific preprocedure restrictions. An average evaluation takes less than 2 minutes and is well-tolerated by the majority of patients.\nKey considerations\nNasal obstruction is a sensation that one or both nasal passages are blocked. There are many causes of nasal obstruction, and the etiology is often multifactorial. Diagnosis requires a thorough history and physical examination, with imaging reserved for surgical planning and evaluating intracranial spread or invasion into adjacent structures. Flexible rhinoscopy is a useful adjunct to the physical examination that allows direct visualization of structures within the superior and posterior nasal cavities that may not be visible with anterior rhinoscopy alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differential diagnoses of nasal obstruction are considerable (see below). A thorough history, including onset, duration, current medications, and aggravating/relieving factors, can help to narrow the differential diagnoses. Constant unilateral obstruction usually results from anatomic obstruction, whereas a seasonal congestion or one that responds to topical decongestants is typically due to an inflammatory pathology. Pediatric patients can present with life-threatening respiratory distress secondary to some congenital causes of nasal obstruction; therefore, prompt evaluation and treatment is essential in these patients.\n\nDifferential diagnoses\nCongenital causes of nasal obstruction include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nChoanal atresia\n\n\n\n\nPyriform aperture stenosis\n\n\n\n\nMidnasal stenosis\n\n\n\n\nEncephalocele\n\n\n\n\nNasal dermoid\n\n\n\n\nGlioma\n\n\n\n\nTeratoma\n\n\n\n\nNasolacrimal duct cyst\n\n\n\n\nTurbinate hypertrophy\n\n\n\n\nSeptal deviation\n\n\n\n\nNeonatal rhinitis\n\n\n\n\nVascular lesions\n\n\n\n\nCraniofacial abnormalities\n\n\n\nAnatomic causes of nasal obstruction include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptal deviation\n\n\n\n\nTurbinate hypertrophy\n\n\n\n\nNasal valve collapse\n\n\n\n\nConcha bullosa\n\n\n\n\nNasal/sinus tumor\n\n\n\n\nNasal polyposis\n\n\n\n\nSeptal perforation\n\n\n\n\nSynechiae\n\n\n\nInflammatory causes of nasal obstruction include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAllergic rhinitis\n\n\n\n\nNonallergic rhinitis\n\n\n\n\nRhinosinusitis\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nRhinitis medicamentosa\n\n\n\nSystemic causes of nasal obstruction include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothyroidism\n\n\n\n\nMedications (antihypertensives, antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers)\n\n\n\n\nRhinitis of pregnancy (rhinopathia gravidarum)\n\n\n\n\nWegener granulomatosis\n\n\n\n\nTuberculosis\n\n\n\n\nSarcoidosis\n\n\n\n\nRhinoscleroma\n\n\n\n\nRhinosporidiosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Frontal Sinus Stenting Techniques": "\nBackground\n\n\nEndoscopic surgery is now commonly used in the management of simple and complex pathologies of the frontal sinus. As experience with the endoscopic technique has grown, use of these procedures for frontal sinus surgery has increased. The goals of endoscopic frontal sinus surgery include disease eradication, implementation and maintenance of an adequate drainage and ventilation pathway, and the restoration of mucociliary function.\nFrontal sinus pathology is particularly challenging to treat due to the narrow and complex anatomy of the frontal outflow tract (see the images below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the lateral nasal wall, schematic: (1) Sphenoid sinus, (2) anterior cranial fossa, (3) anterior ethmoid cell, (4) frontal sinus, (5) agger nasi, (6) infundibulum, (7) posterior ethmoid cell \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the frontal recess. The frontal recess is an hour glass-shaped space (green shaded area) with the waist at the frontal ostium and its narrowest part that drains into the ethmoid infundibulum: (1) frontal sinus, (2) frontal ostium, (3) agger nasi cell, (4) bulla ethmoidalis, (5) anterior cranial fossa, (6) infundibulum \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStenosis of the frontal recess or failure to establish a tract can lead to disease persistence and iatrogenic complications. Postoperative stenosis of the frontal sinus outflow due to formation of scar tissue, synechiae, or osteogenesis is the most common cause of frontal sinus surgery failure.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nStenosis of the frontal recess is best prevented by avoiding unnecessary manipulation of the outflow tract and meticulous surgical technique. Without formal frontal ostium dissection, anterior ethmoidectomy with exposure of the frontal recess has been shown to result in resolution of frontal sinus disease.\n [2] The indications for a formal frontal sinusotomy should therefore be carefully determined. If frontal recess dissection is undertaken, meticulous tissue handling with avoidance of any mucosal trauma is key to a successful outcome. Routine frontal stenting is unnecessary (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3A: Intraoperative endoscopic view of the dissected frontal ostium after total anterior ethmoidectomy and Draf 2a frontal ostioplasty (70º endoscope view): (A) nasal beak, (B) frontal neo-ostium, (C) anterior skull base. Postoperative view of frontal ostium with a 70º endoscope. 3b: Well-healed, mucosalized frontal neo-ostium 3 months after Draf 2a (frontal ostioplasty). No stent was used in this case. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe most common cause of restenosis of the frontal sinus outflow tract is iatrogenic (postoperative scarring, adhesions, and middle turbinate lateralization). Severe inflammatory pathology, obstructive polyposis, and nonsurgical trauma are other common causes.\n\nThe incidence of persistent frontal sinusitis with symptoms after endoscopic sinus surgery is 2-11% based on numerous studies, all with relatively short follow-up.\n [3] The necessity of longer follow-up after frontal sinus surgery to determine the true incidence of disease relapse was demonstrated by Neel et al. In their study, failure rate after modified Lynch procedure increased from 7% at 3.7 years to 30% at 7 years.\n [4] Frontal sinus stenting may help prevent failure of standard endoscopic treatment of frontal sinus disease by maintaining patency and structural integrity of the frontal sinus outflow tract while regeneration of the frontal neo-ostium mucosal lining takes place.\n [5] In many situations, such as after a drill-out procedure (modified Lothrop or Draf III) for neo-osteogenesis or tumor removal, the mucosal lining is absent or significantly violated. Stenting may be useful in such situations.\n\nSurgically placed stents to maintain ventilation and drainage of the frontal sinuses have been used for over a century. The first frontal sinus stents were gold tubes used in 1905 by Ingals.\n [5] In 1921, Lynch first described his frontoethmoidectomy technique, of which a key component was 1-cm rubber tubing used to stent the frontal sinus.\n [6] Progress in both surgical instrumentation and new stent material has been made over subsequent years. Numerous options are now available for stenting in cases that have an anticipated high risk of surgical failure. Stents differ in terms of material, shape, and the techniques used to deploy them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction to Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery\nRhinology and sinus surgery have undergone a tremendous expansion since the discourses of Messerklinger and Wigand in the late 1970s.\n [1, 2, 3] Imaging advances, increased understanding of the anatomy and the pathophysiology of chronic sinusitis, and image-guided surgery have allowed surgeons to perform more complex procedures with increased safety.\n\n\nOutstanding short- and long-term results have been reported in the literature. Senior et al reported that symptoms improved in 66 of 72 (91.6%) patients following endoscopic sinus surgery, with a mean follow-up time of 7.8 years.\n [4] In addition, endoscopic sinus surgery significantly influences quality of life; Damm et al reported an improvement in quality of life for 85% of their patient population, with a mean follow-up time of 31.7 months.\n [5] \nAlthough functional endoscopic sinus surgery is the primary approach used today for the surgical treatment of chronic sinusitis, the time-honored external approaches still play a role. Therefore, familiarity with endoscopic and external approaches, in conjunction with a precise understanding of the anatomy, ensures optimal patient care and outcome.\n\n\n\n\nA recently developed alternative to functional endoscopic sinus surgery is balloon sinuplasty. This technique uses balloon catheters to dilate the maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid natural ostia without bone or soft-tissue removal. Reports show persistent patient symptom improvement and sinus ostia patency. Further study and long-term outcomes with this technology will determine its role in endoscopic sinus surgery.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nIndications for Endoscopic Sinus Surgery\nEndoscopic sinus surgery is most commonly performed for inflammatory and infectious sinus disease. The most common indications for endoscopic sinus surgery are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nChronic sinusitis refractory to medical treatment\n\n\n\n\nRecurrent sinusitis\n\n\n\n\nNasal polyposis\n\n\n\n\nAntrochoanal polyps\n\n\n\n\nSinus mucoceles\n\n\n\n\nExcision of selected tumors\n\n\n\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak closure\n\n\n\n\nOrbital decompression (eg, Graves ophthalmopathy)\n\n\n\n\nOptic nerve decompression\n\n\n\n\nDacryocystorhinostomy (DCR)\n\n\n\n\nChoanal atresia repair\n\n\n\n\nForeign body removal\n\n\n\n\nEpistaxis control\n\n\n\nTypically, endoscopic sinus surgery is reserved for patients with documented rhinosinusitis, based on a thorough history and a complete physical examination, including CT scans if appropriate, and in whom appropriate medical treatment has failed.\n\nMedical therapy alone may be inadequate for treatment of nasal polyposis. Aukema et al found that although 12 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate nasal drops reduced the need for sinus surgery in patients with nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis, 14 of 27 patients still required surgery.\n [7] Similarly, antrochoanal polyps require surgical removal.\n\nNasal masses\nIncreasingly, selected nasal masses and tumors are being removed endoscopically. Endoscopic removal of inverted papilloma is controversial. Endoscopic surgery can be performed for limited lesions in which definitive control and margins can be obtained endoscopically; this circumstance can be predicted preoperatively via nasal endoscopy and imaging.\n\nMore extensive lesions should be approached externally; either a lateral rhinotomy method or a midfacial degloving method can be used for en bloc tumor removal. Further research with long-term monitoring in this area will better delineate the optimal treatment for these patients.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid leaks\nCSF leaks associated with CSF rhinorrhea can be managed endoscopically. Success rates of 80% have been reported in the literature with primary endoscopic attempts; success rates increase to 90% if revision endoscopic closures are included.\n\nWith endoscopic repair of CSF leaks, the more extensive neurosurgical external approaches via craniotomy can be avoided. In certain clinical settings, endonasal encephaloceles are repaired via endoscopic approaches.\n\nOphthalmic procedures\nEndoscopic approaches may also be applied for ophthalmic procedures, including orbital decompression, endoscopic DCR, and optic nerve decompression for traumatic indirect optic neuropathy. Traditionally, these procedures were performed through external approaches, but as clinical experience in nasal endoscopic techniques has increased, they are now performed endoscopically. Only surgeons with extensive training in, and expertise with, endoscopic techniques should perform these procedures.\n\nContraindications to Endoscopic Sinus Surgery\nCertain sinus conditions may not respond completely to endoscopic treatment; these include intraorbital complications of acute sinusitis, such as orbital abscess or frontal osteomyelitis with Potts puffy tumor. An open approach, with or without additional endoscopic assistance, may be preferable in these instances. A careful review of preoperative CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans helps guide the surgeon.\n\nAfter 2 failures to endoscopically manage CSF leaks associated with CSF rhinorrhea, patients should be referred to a neurosurgeon for closure using a neurosurgical approach. Likewise, after failure to endoscopically manage frontal sinus disease, open approaches should be considered.\n\nClinical Evaluation\nThe cornerstone of accurate diagnosis and treatment of chronic sinusitis is a thorough history and a complete physical examination, including nasal endoscopy. Surgery should not be considered unless the evaluation clearly identifies chronic sinusitis as the cause of the patient's constellation of symptoms.\n\nThe history should elucidate the frequency of infections, the type and the duration of symptoms, and the response to medical therapy. Patients with chronic or recurrent symptoms typically report the following symptoms:\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal congestion\n\n\n\n\nPurulent drainage\n\n\n\n\nPostnasal drip\n\n\n\n\nFacial pressure and headache\n\n\n\n\nHyposmia or anosmia\n\n\n\n\nNasal obstruction\n\n\n\nHowever, other conditions can mimic chronic sinusitis, causing 1 or more of the above symptoms. Therefore, ruling out other etiologies for the patient's symptoms is imperative. For example, patients with allergic rhinitis may have similar problems, such as sneezing, watery eyes, itchy eyes, nasal congestion, and postnasal drip. If the patient's only problem is allergic rhinitis, then endoscopic sinus surgery is not the solution, and proper medical treatment should be prescribed.\n\nA physical examination is an excellent adjunct to patient history in diagnosing or excluding chronic sinusitis. A complete head and neck examination, along with anterior rhinoscopy, should be performed. If further nasal examination is required, a full nasal endoscopy should be carried out. The patient should be assessed for the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptal deviation\n\n\n\n\nTurbinate hypertrophy\n\n\n\n\nNasal polyps\n\n\n\n\nNasal airway problems, including dynamic internal or external valve collapse\n\n\n\n\nOstiomeatal complex, if visible\n\n\n\n\nAdenoidal hypertrophy\n\n\n\nRigid nasal endoscopy with mild septal deviation is depicted in the videos below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRigid nasal endoscopy performed in the clinic. A mild left septal deviation is seen anteriorly. The left middle turbinate and middle meatus are normal. Video courtesy of Vijay R Ramakrishnan, MD. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRigid nasal endoscopy. The right side contains normal turbinates and middle meatus with a small amount of mucus in the inferior meatus. The endoscopy concludes with visualization of the soft palate, nasopharynx, and Eustachian tube orifices. Video courtesy of Vijay R Ramakrishnan, MD. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPercussion of the sinuses to elicit tenderness may provide additional information; however, this is an imperfect technique in terms of sensitivity and specificity.\n\nPatients with suspicious findings on history and physical examination should undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning. In patients with normal findings on paranasal sinus CT scans and no change in symptoms after undergoing medical treatment, a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis is suspect at best. These patients should not be offered functional endoscopic sinus surgery as a treatment for their symptoms.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nIntimate knowledge and understanding of the anatomy of the lateral nasal wall and the sinuses (see the image below), in conjunction with a careful preoperative review of CT scans, are paramount in the safe and complete performance of endoscopic sinus surgery. The following description of endonasal anatomy is roughly based on the order of dissection during nasal endoscopy and surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral nasal wall anatomy and paranasal sinus ostia. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nNasal septum and inferior turbinate\nImmediately upon entering the nasal cavity, the first structures encountered are the nasal septum and the inferior turbinate. The nasal septum consists of the quadrangular cartilage anteriorly, extending to the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone posterosuperiorly and the vomer posteroinferiorly.\n\nRecognizing deflections of the nasal septum preoperatively is important because they may significantly contribute to nasal obstruction and limit endoscopic visualization during surgery. As appropriate, patients with septum deflections may be counseled regarding the need for septoplasty in conjunction with functional endoscopic sinus surgery.\n\nThe inferior turbinate extends along the inferior lateral nasal wall posteriorly toward the nasopharynx. In patients with a significant allergic component to their problems, the inferior turbinates may be edematous. These patients may benefit from a turbinate reduction at the same time as the endoscopic sinus surgery. The inferior meatus, where the nasolacrimal duct opens, is located approximately 1 cm beyond the most anterior edge of the inferior turbinate.\n\nMiddle turbinate\nAs the endoscope is further advanced into the nose, the next structure encountered is the middle turbinate. The middle turbinate is a key landmark in endoscopic sinus surgery. It has a vertical component (lying in the sagittal plane, running from posterior to anterior) and a horizontal component (lying in the coronal plane, running from medial to lateral).\n\nSuperiorly, the middle turbinate attaches to the skull base at the cribriform plate. As such, care should always be taken when manipulating the middle turbinate.\n\nThe horizontal component of the middle turbinate is referred to as the basal (or grand) lamella, and it represents the dividing point between anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells. Posteriorly and inferiorly, the middle turbinate attaches to the lateral nasal wall at the crista ethmoidalis, just anterior to the sphenopalatine foramen.\n\nUncinate process\nThe uncinate process is the next key structure to be identified in endoscopic sinus surgery. This L-shaped bone of the lateral nasal wall forms the anterior border of the hiatus semilunaris, or the infundibulum. The infundibulum is the location of the ostiomeatal complex, where the natural ostium of the maxillary sinus opens.\n\nFor patients with sinus disease, a patent ostiomeatal complex is critical for improvement of symptoms. Anteriorly, the uncinate process attaches to the lacrimal bone, and inferiorly, the uncinate process attaches to the ethmoidal process of the inferior turbinate.\n\nNatural maxillary ostium\nOnce the uncinate process is removed, the natural maxillary ostium can be seen, typically just posterior to the uncinate process, roughly one third of the distance along the middle turbinate from its anterior edge. It lies at approximately the level of the inferior border of the middle turbinate, superior to the inferior turbinate.\n\nThe natural maxillary ostium is the destination for the mucociliary flow within the maxillary sinus. Therefore, for optimal results, the surgically enlarged maxillary antrostomy must include the natural ostium. In fact, failure to include the maxillary ostium in endoscopic surgical antrostomy is one of the key patterns of failure in functional endoscopic sinus surgery.\n\nThe maxillary sinus, approximately 14-15 mL in volume, is bordered superiorly by the inferior orbital wall, medially by the lateral nasal wall, and inferiorly by the alveolar portion of the maxillary bone.\n\nEthmoid bulla\nThe next structure to be encountered is the ethmoid bulla, which is one of the most constant anterior ethmoidal air cells. It is just beyond the natural ostium of the maxillary sinus and forms the posterior border of the hiatus semilunaris.\n\nThe lateral extent of the bulla is the lamina papyracea. Superiorly, the ethmoid bulla may extend all the way to the ethmoid roof (the skull base). Alternatively, a suprabullar recess may exist above the roof of the bulla. A careful preoperative review of the patient's CT scan clarifies this relationship.\n\nEthmoid sinus\nThe ethmoid sinus consists of a variable number (typically 7-15) of air cells. The most lateral border of these air cells is the lamina papyracea, and the most superior border of these cells is the skull base. Supraorbital ethmoid cells may be present. A review of the patient's CT scan alerts the surgeon to these variations.\n\nThe basal lamella of the middle turbinate separates the anterior ethmoid cells from the posterior ethmoid cells. Anterior ethmoid cells drain to the middle meatus, and the posterior cells drain into the superior meatus.\n\nSphenoid sinus\nExenteration of the posterior ethmoid cells exposes the face of the sphenoid. The sphenoid sinus is the most posterior of the paranasal sinuses, sitting just superior to the nasopharynx and just anterior and inferior to the sella turcica. The anterior face of the sphenoid sits approximately 7 cm from the nasal sill on a 30° axis from the horizontal.\n\nSeveral important structures are related to the sphenoid sinus. The internal carotid artery is typically the most posterior and medial impression seen within the sphenoid sinus. In approximately 7% of cases, the bone is dehiscent.\n\nThe optic nerve and its bony encasement produce an anterosuperior indentation within the roof of the sphenoid sinus. In 4% of cases, the bone surrounding the optic nerve is dehiscent. Therefore, controlled opening of the sphenoid sinus, typically at its natural ostium, is critical for a safe outcome.\n\nThe location of the natural ostium of the sphenoid sinus is variable. In approximately 60% of people, the ostium is located medial to the superior turbinate, and in 40%, it is located lateral to the superior turbinate.\n\nFrontal recess\nThe frontal recess, or the frontal sinus outflow tract, is the tract that leads from the frontal sinus into the nasal cavity. Often, the ethmoid bulla is the posterior border of the frontal sinus outflow tract.\n\nAnteriorly, the frontal sinus outflow tract is bordered by the uncinate process or the agger nasi cells (frontal anterior ethmoid air cells). If any of these cells are enlarged or if scarring is present from a previous surgery, resultant outflow tract obstruction, leading to frontal sinusitis, may occur. Typically, the medial wall of the frontal recess is formed by the lamina papyracea.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Paranasal Sinus Anatomy, Nasal Anatomy, and Skull Base Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Glossectomy": "\nPre-Procedure\n\n\nBackground\nThe tongue is a highly specialized, vital organ of the oral cavity. Resecting a part or all of the tongue presents a wide array of challenges that require the surgeon to avoid, limit, or restore the severe functional impairments to gustation, mastication, deglutition, and phonation.\n\n\nThis purpose of this chapter is to review the embryology, anatomy, and the most common malignancy of the tongue. The authors also address the clinical evaluation, surgeries and reconstructions, post-operative course, and prognosis of patients undergoing glossectomy.\nEmbryology\nThe tongue appears during the fourth week of development with the appearance of the tuberculum impar, a mesenchyme swelling in the floor of the primitive pharynx cranial to the foramen cecum. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is formed from the two lateral swellings (derived from the first pharyngeal arch) that develop on either side of the tuberculum impar. These lingual buds fuse together and form the median sulcus of the tongue. The posterior one-third of the tongue arises from the hypobranchial eminence overgrowth of the copula. The copula is formed by the ventromedial parts of the second pharyngeal arch and the cranial part of the third pharyngeal arch. The hypobranchial eminence is formed by the ventromedial parts of the third and fourth pharyngeal arches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe epithelium of the tongue develops from foregut endoderm. Most tongue muscles develop from myoblasts that migrate from the occipital myotomes. The connective tissue, lymphatic vessels, and blood vessels of the tongue arise from pharyngeal arch mesenchyme.\n\nHistology\nThe tongue is lined by masticatory stratified squamous epithelium. The magnitude of physical forces during function dictates the degree of epithelial keratinization of the tongue in comparison to other areas within the oral cavity.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nGross Anatomy\n\nFrom anterior to posterior, the tongue has 3 surfaces: tip, body, and base. The tip is the highly mobile, pointed anterior portion of the tongue. Posterior to the tip lies the body of the tongue, which has dorsal (superior) and ventral (inferior) surfaces (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTongue, dorsal view. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nMuscles\n\nThe 8 muscles of the human tongue are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic. The 4 intrinsic muscles act to change the shape of the tongue and are not attached to any bone. The 4 extrinsic muscles act to change the position the tongue and are anchored to bone. They are the genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, palatoglossus.\n\nVascular supply\n\nThe tongue receives its blood supply primarily from the lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. The floor of the mouth also receives its blood supply from the lingual artery. The triangle formed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle, the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle, and the hypoglossal nerve is sometimes called Pirogov-Belclard 's triangle. The secondary blood supply to the tongue is from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery.\n\nNerve supply\n\nTaste for the anterior two thirds of the tongue is supplied by the facial nerve (chorda tympani, CN VII). General sensation of the anterior two thirds of the tongue is supplied by the lingual nerve, which is a branch of CN V3. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) provides general sensation for the posterior one-third tongue. All intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), except for one of the extrinsic muscles, palatoglossus, which is innervated by CN X of the pharyngeal plexus.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Tongue Anatomy.\n\nPhysiology of the swallow\nInitiation of swallow begins with containing the food bolus within the oral cavity. Freely mobile tongue is then able to make contact with the anterior palate, form the bolus, and initiate posterior movement of the base of tongue toward the pharyngeal wall, which propels food bolus toward the back of the throat. Elevation of the hyoid and larynx allows opening of the upper esophageal sphincter and bolus is passed.\n\nPathology\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC)\n\nGreater than 95% of tongue cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Treatment consideration of other, less common malignancies of the tongue (adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma) and sarcomas (alveolar soft part sarcoma) is beyond the scope of this chapter. The principles established for partial and total glossectomy for SCC can be generally applied to other malignancies.\n\nSCC of the tongue generally presents in the fifth and sixth decade of life and is more common in males.\n [1, 2] Smoking tobacco and ethanol abuse are strongly associated with the development of SCC of the tongue, and patients who abuse both tobacco and ethanol have a 6-fold to 15-fold increased risk of developing cancer.\n [3, 4, 5] \n\nLymph node metastasis\n\nThe lymphatic spread of tongue SCC generally occurs in an orderly manner, involving first the uppermost (levels I-II), then middle (levels II-III), and finally the lower cervical lymph nodes (level IV). Lymphatic drainage for the tongue includes the internal jugular, subdigastric, omohyoid, submandibular, and submental nodal basins (levels I-III).\n\nThe anterior pathway drains the tip of the oral tongue and primarily drains to level III. The lateral group drains the lateral one third of the dorsum of the tongue from the tip to the circumvallate papillae to submandibular, and internal jugular nodal basins and occasionally the submental node basin (levels I-III). The central pathway drains the central two thirds of the tongue. These vessels drain to the submental region (level I) or the upper cervical chain nodal basin via the sublingual nodes (level III).\n [6] Primary lesions of the tongue that approach midline often drain to bilateral nodal basins, as significant lymphatic crossover exists in this region.\n [7] \n\nPatient evaluation\nPatients who present for the evaluation of tongue cancer require a detailed history and thorough physical examination. The clinician should ascertain the presence and duration of symptoms such as pain, bleeding, otalgia, odynophagia, dysphagia, and dysarthria. The history should document risk factors such as the use of tobacco and alcohol, recent dietary habits, weight loss, medical co-morbidities, and family history of disease.\n\nPhysical examination is performed to evaluate the pretreatment condition of the patient, including extent of primary tumor, presence and location of cervical lymph node metastases, as well as screening for synchronous primary malignancies. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy should be performed in the office for examination of the airway which is often compromised in advanced disease as well as assessment of laryngeal involvement.\n\nBiopsy of tongue lesions can usually be performed in the clinical setting with local anesthesia or may be performed under general anesthesia during formal panendoscopy. Palpable neck masses or large metastatic cervical lymph nodes are usually amenable to fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is often used in obtaining a diagnosis when suspected cervical disease is difficult to localize and has been reported to have superior sensitivity and specificity when compared to traditional fine needle aspiration.\n [8] Open surgical biopsy of suspected cervical metastatic disease is generally contraindicated.\n\nDiagnostic imaging\nComputed tomography\n\nComputed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast is the most commonly used radiographic study for tongue cancer. Contrast CT allows for a 3-dimensional evaluation of the primary tumor giving invaluable information regarding related anatomic structures and the extent of local invasion. In general, patients diagnosed with advanced SCC of the tongue should also undergo contrast CT of the chest to evaluate for pulmonary metastatic disease.\n\nCT remains the imaging modality of choice when evaluating the clinically N0, obese, or previously-irradiated neck for cervical metastatic disease.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior soft tissue resolution when compared to CT. Increased diagnostic accuracy in extension of soft tissue primary lesion as well as improved accuracy for cervical lymph node staging has prompted some authors to recommend routine MRI scanning for head and neck malignancy.\n [9] MRI offers an excellent imaging modality, with accuracy superior to conventional CT scanning when evaluation of the extent of invasion of the primary tumor is required. Large lesions located within the tongue and floor of mouth that are subject to dental and osseous tomographic artifact are particularly amenable to MRI. MRI is especially useful in cases that exhibit perineural invasion and can improve accuracy related to extension of disease in these lesions. Despite this increased accuracy, as in the case of CT, MRI offers insufficient accuracy to detect micrometastatic disease.\n\nPositron emission tomography\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that uses a radio-labeled tracer, 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18-FDG), to detect metabolically active cells, as is the case with cancer. PET has increased accuracy (true positives) for the detection of head and neck malignancy, post-therapy tumor surveillance, and evaluation for cervical/distant metastatic disease.\n [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] \n\nWith a known primary lesion in the advanced stage, PET offers little advantage over CT or MRI. PET offers inferior resolution for evaluating the extent of the primary lesion and should be combined with CT to improve diagnostic accuracy. Currently, the limit of detection correlates to a resolution of approximately 5 mm. Although PET offers significant promise in the evaluation of the N0 neck in early stage disease, in patients with advanced tongue cancers, the status of the neck is only of prognostic significance.\n\nPanendoscopy\n\nPanendoscopy (direct laryngoscopy, esophagoscopy, bronchoscopy) is frequently helpful when evaluating tongue cancers. The extent of the primary tumor is evaluated, particularly the relationship of the tumor to the midline, base of tongue, and mandible. Biopsies are obtained at the time of the panendoscopy if the histologic diagnosis has yet been established. Panendoscopy is also used to rule out synchronous malignancies.\n\nTongue SCC staging\nAll patients evaluated for head and neck malignancy should be staged according the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system for oral cavity lesion, as shown below.\n [16] \n\nAJCC TNM Classification: Oral cavity SCCA\n\nPrimary Tumor (T)\n\n\n\n\n\nTX - Primary tumor cannot be assessed\n\n\n\n\nT0 - No evidence of primary tumor\n\n\n\n\nTis - Carcinoma in situ\n\n\n\n\nT1 - Tumor 2 cm or less in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nT2 - Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nT3 - Tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nT4 (lip) - Tumor invades through cortical bone, inferior alveolar nerve, floor of mouth, or skin of face, ie, chin or nose\n\n\n\n\nT4a (oral cavity) - Tumor invades through cortical bone, into deep (extrinsic) muscle of tongue (genioglossus, hyoglossus, palatoglossus, and styloglossus) maxillary sinus, or skin of face\n\n\n\n\nT4b - Tumor involves masticator space, pterygoid plates, or skull base and/or encases internal carotid artery\n\n\n\nRegional Lymph Nodes (N)\n\n\n\n\n\nNX - Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed\n\n\n\n\nN0 - No regional lymph node metastasis\n\n\n\n\nN1 - Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nN2 - Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, more than 3 cm but not more than 6 cm in greatest dimension; or in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nN2a - Metastasis in single ipsilateral lymph node more than 3cm but not more than 6cm in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nN2b - Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6cm in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nN2c - Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6cm in greatest dimension\n\n\n\n\nN3 - Metastasis in a lymph node more than 6cm in greatest dimension\n\n\n\nDistant Metastasis (M)\n\n\n\n\n\nMX - Distant metastasis cannot be assessed\n\n\n\n\nM0 - No distant metastasis\n\n\n\n\nM1 - Distant metastasis\n\n\n\nAJCC Staging System: Oral Cavity SCCA\n\nStage Grouping\n\n\n\n\n\n0, Tis, N0, M0\n\n\n\n\nI, T1, N0, M0\n\n\n\n\nII, T2, N0, M0\n\n\n\n\nIII, T3, N0, M0\n\n\n\n\nT1, N1, M0\n\n\n\n\nT2, N1, M0\n\n\n\n\nT3, N1, M0\n\n\n\n\nIVA, T4a, N0, M0\n\n\n\n\nT4a, N1, M0\n\n\n\n\nT1, N2, M0\n\n\n\n\nT2, N2, M0\n\n\n\n\nT3, N2, M0\n\n\n\n\nIVB, any T, N3, M0\n\n\n\n\nT4b, any N, M0\n\n\n\n\nIVC, any T, any N, M1\n\n\n\nFactors affecting prognosis\nTumor thickness\n\nIn general, increased tumor size and thickness is significantly predictive of decreased survival and increases the rate of locoregional recurrence. Measuring tumor thickness and pattern of invasion in patients with early oral cancer may allow for the identification of those patients with more aggressive disease. Patients with tumor diameter greater than 1.5 cm or greater than 5 mm of tumor thickness may then be considered for more aggressive adjuvant therapy and elective neck dissection regardless of stage due to increased risk for cervical lymph node metastasis.\n [17, 18, 19] \n\nMRI is sufficiently accurate to determine tumor thickness of oral cavity SCC, although histologic evaluation remains the standard.\n [20, 21, 22, 23] Although tumor thickness reliably predicts regional nodal metastasis and decreased survival, specific treatment strategies based on tumor thickness have yet to be evaluated due to the wide range of factors related to prognosis among patients with oral cavitySCC.\n [24] In the case of advanced-stage oral cavity SCC (stages III, IV), tumor thickness is generally not a consideration in treatment planning as the depth usually exceeds 5 mm and patients generally receive aggressive surgery with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.\n\nPerineural invasion\n\nPerineural invasion has been associated with increased risk local recurrence and cervical metastasis and is generally thought to be an independent predictor of survival for patients with oral cavity SCC.\n [25, 26, 27] The presence of even small peripheral nerve involvement has been associated with decreased survival. If pathologically confirmed, this should prompt strong consideration for a full course of postoperative radiotherapy to treat the primary tumor as outcomes related to locoregional recurrence are poor.\n [28, 29] \n\nPositive surgical margins\n\nMicroscopic residual tumor resulting from positive surgical margins statistically increases local recurrence and mortality when treating SCC of the head and neck. Patients treated with surgery as the primary modality exhibit significantly improved local control rates if a negative surgical margin is obtained. Surgeons performing resections for advanced primary oral cavity SCC should strive for a minimum of 1 cm margin, with 2–3 cm margins preferred, to minimize the likelihood of positive margins. Positive surgical margins either at the primary site or within the neck after neck dissection require the use of postoperative radiotherapy to improve outcomes. Two-year disease-free survival has been reported to improve from 33.6% to 75.6% in patients with positive surgical margins who received postoperative radiotherapy (≥62.5 Gy).\n [30] \n\nCervical metastasis\n\nThe presence of cervical lymph node metastasis has been repeatedly cited as the most significant factor that portends decreased survival and locoregional recurrence in tongue SCC. Furthermore, cervical lymph node metastasis located at more distant levels of the neck (levels III/IV), or in the contralateral neck, also tend to have significantly decreased survival rates. Overall 5-year survival rates when comparing patients without evidence of cervical lymph node metastasis to those with positive nodal disease have been reported as 42.8% and 17.5% respectively.\n [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] Patients who present with advanced stage oral cavity SCC generally present with lymph node metastasis by definition. The presence of cervical lymph node metastasis should be considered an ominous sign and should prompt early, aggressive treatment in order to optimize outcomes.\n\nExtracapsular extension\n\nCervical lymph node metastasis which exhibit extracapsular extension has a statistically decreased overall survival.\n [38] The presence of nodal extracapsular extension is also concerning for cervical recurrence after therapy. Advanced stage tongue SCC may present with extensive cervical nodal disease that increases the likelihood of extracapsular extension. Patients with multiple lymph nodes exhibiting extracapsular extension generally have an extremely poor prognosis.\n [38] \n\nDecision factors in treatment planning\nTumor thickness\n\nIn general, increased tumor size and thickness is significantly predictive of decreased survival and increases the rate of locoregional recurrence. Measuring tumor thickness and pattern of invasion in patients with early oral cancer may allow for the identification of those patients with more aggressive disease. Patients with tumor diameter greater than 1.5 cm or greater than 5 mm of tumor thickness may then be considered for more aggressive adjuvant therapy and elective neck dissection regardless of stage due to increased risk for cervical lymph node metastasis.\n [17, 18] \n\nMRI is sufficiently accurate to determine tumor thickness of oral cavity SCC although histologic evaluation remains the standard.\n [20, 21] Although tumor thickness reliably predicts regional nodal metastasis and decreased survival, specific treatment strategies based on tumor thickness have yet to be evaluated due to the wide range of factors related to prognosis among patients with oral cavity SCC.\n [24] In the case of advanced stage oral cavity SCC (stages III, IV), tumor thickness is generally not a consideration in treatment planning, as the depth usually exceeds 5 mm and patients generally receive aggressive surgery with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.\n\nPerineural invasion\n\nPerineural invasion has been associated with increased risk local recurrence and cervical metastasis and is generally thought to be an independent predictor of survival for patients with oral cavity SCC.\n [25, 26, 27] The presence of even small peripheral nerve involvement has been associated with decreased survival.

The presence of cervical lymph node metastasis should be considered an ominous sign and should prompt early, aggressive treatment in order to optimize outcomes.\n\nExtracapsular extension\n\nCervical lymph node metastasis that exhibits extracapsular extension has a statistically decreased overall survival.\n [38] The presence of nodal extracapsular extension is also concerning for cervical recurrence after therapy. Advanced stage tongue SCC may present with extensive cervical nodal disease, which increases the likelihood of extracapsular extension. Patients with multiple lymph nodes exhibiting extracapsular extension generally have an extremely poor prognosis.\n [38] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Hard Palate Resection": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe oral cavity functions as the interface between the respiratory/digestive tracts and the outside world. It contributes to a complex array of functions that include speech, mastication, salivation, early digestion, and oral/oronasal competence. Tumors of the hard palate are uncommon. Resection of the hard palate may be necessary for the management of benign or malignant tumors or as a donor site for a mucosal graft.\n\n\nKey considerations\nAlthough squamous cell carcinoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the oral cavity, the most common tumors of the hard palate are of minor salivary gland origin. These include benign tumors such as pleomorphic adenomas, as shown below, and malignant tumors such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. Other histologies less frequently encountered include verrucous carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, and lymphoma. The lung, kidney, breast, and skin are the most common sites of primary carcinoma that metastasize to the oral cavity.\n [1, 2, 3]  Classification of oral cavity tumors has been created by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and is reviewed in Table 1.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPleomorphic adenoma of hard palate in Asian woman. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Although it is a stiff graft, it is moist and flexible, thus allowing appropriate functioning as a tectonic support in facial reconstruction such as in the lower eyelids, lower lip, nasal ala, and in mucosal defects in oral surgery.\n [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] The hard palate mucosa exists as a keratinizing squamous epithelium on a dense, collagenous lamina propria, very similar in structure to native tarsus in the eyelid.\n\nIndications\nThe indications to perform hard palate resection include excision of malignant and benign tumors, to alleviate complications from tumor burden that compromise the function of the oral cavity, and for facial reconstruction such as in cases of eyelid, lip, and nasal ala deformities.\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to hard palate resection include inability to tolerate general anesthesia, extensive lesions that may require more radical surgical intervention, and tumors that may be more appropriately treated with local irradiation and/or chemotherapy.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe oral cavity (see the image below) is oval shaped and is separated into the oral vestibule and the oral cavity proper. It is bound by the lips anteriorly, the cheeks laterally, the floor of the mouth inferiorly, the oropharynx posteriorly, and the palate superiorly. The oropharynx begins superiorly at the junction between the hard palate and the soft palate, and inferiorly behind the circumvallate papillae of the tongue. The bony base of the oral cavity is represented by the maxillary and mandibular bones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of oral cavity and floor of mouth.

It is divided into a hard portion and a soft portion. The hard palate belongs to the oral cavity and separates it from the nasal cavities. The soft palate belongs to the oropharynx and separates it from the nasopharynx.\n\nThe hard palate is concave, and this concavity is occupied mostly by the tongue when it is at rest. The hard palate is subdivided into the primary and secondary palates. The primary palate is separated from the secondary palate by a small depression behind the central incisors termed the incisive fossa, where the incisive foramen opens.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Mouth Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Impedance Audiometry": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe primary purpose of impedance audiometry is to determine the status of the tympanic membrane and middle ear via tympanometry. The secondary purpose of this test is to evaluate acoustic reflex pathways, which include cranial nerves (CN) VII and VIII and the auditory brainstem. This test cannot be used to directly assess auditory sensitivity, although results are interpreted in conjunction with other threshold measures.\nAcoustic immittance is a measurement of energy or air pressure flow, which involves the ear canal, eardrum, ossicular chain, tensor tympani, stapedius muscle, cochlea, CNs VII and VIII, and the brainstem. Mass, mobility, and resistance of the outer and middle ear systems affect this test. The reciprocal of acoustic immittance is acoustic impedance. Particularly in earlier years, these measurements were performed in impedance rather than immittance measures; thus, the term impedance audiometry is sometimes used.\n\n\nThe image below depicts a type A tympanogram, suggesting normal function.\n\n\n\n\n\nType A tympanogram suggesting normal function. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic immittance tests\nThe following tests are included in the category acoustic immittance tests:\n\n\n\n\n\nTympanometry (most commonly used)\n\n\n\n\nEustachian tube function\n\n\n\n\nPerilymphatic fistula test (efficacy questionable)\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic reflex thresholds\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic reflex decay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic reflex thresholds\nAn acoustic reflex threshold is a middle ear measurement of stapedius muscle response to higher intensity and adequate duration sounds for individual frequencies. Consider the softest sound that elicits a reflex contraction of the stapedius muscle as the acoustic reflex threshold. When the stapedius muscle contracts in response to a loud sound, that contraction changes the middle ear immittance. This change in immittance can be detected as a deflection in the recording.\n\nTympanometry records changes in middle ear immittance, while air pressure is varied in the ear canal and acoustic reflexes are recorded at a single air pressure setting (ie, the pressure setting that provided the peak immittance reading for that particular ear on the tympanogram). Ear canal pressure is maintained at that specific setting, while tones of various intensities are presented into the ear canal and immittance is recorded. A significant change in middle ear immittance immediately after the stimulus is considered an acoustic reflex.\n\nA stapedial muscle contraction in response to an intense signal occurs bilaterally in normal ears with either unilateral or bilateral stimulation. This reaction occurs because the stapedial reflex pathway has both ipsilateral and contralateral projections. Acoustic reflex thresholds generally are determined in response to stimuli of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. For screening purposes, or for a general check of the pathway's integrity, usually test at 1000 Hz.\n\nTypes of acoustic reflex\n\nFor the ipsilateral or uncrossed acoustic reflex, stimulate the ear that is monitored for response. The assessed pathway involves the cochlea, ventral cochlear nucleus, CN VIII, CN VII and its motor nucleus, and the stapedius muscle—all on the side ipsilateral to the stimulus.\n\nFor the contralateral or crossed acoustic reflex, present the stimulus to the ear opposite the ear that is monitored for response. The assessed pathway involves the ipsilateral cochlea, ventral cochlear nucleus, and CN VIII; the pathway crosses the trapezoid body and then involves the contralateral medial superior olive, CN VII and its motor nucleus, and the stapedius muscle.\n\nVariability of acoustic reflex thresholds\n\nThresholds vary according to individual hearing sensitivity and retrocochlear function. The range for acoustic reflexes in individuals with normal hearing averages 70-100 decibel (dB) sound pressure level (SPL). The greater the hearing loss, the higher the acoustic reflex threshold for conductive hearing loss. For sensorineural hearing loss, acoustic reflex thresholds may be within the normal range, particularly for mild-to-moderate hearing losses with recruitment.\n\nElevated or absent acoustic reflex thresholds (ie, >100 dB SPL) for any given frequency may suggest sensorineural or conductive hearing loss, facial nerve disorder, or middle ear disorder. Reflexes usually are absent or cannot be recorded if the patient has type B tympanograms; therefore, acoustic reflexes generally are not tested in these ears.\n\nFor example, if the ear canal is occluded with cerumen, a type B tympanogram with low volume will be recorded. In this case, acoustic reflexes cannot be measured because middle ear immittance is not being measured. (Cerumen blocks the signal.)\n\nFor a type B tympanogram with normal volume (as in otitis media) no pressure peak for immittance is obtained. The pressure between the ear canal and middle ear are not equilibrated, and acoustic reflexes cannot be recorded.\n\nFor a type B tympanogram with high volume (as in the presence of patent pressure equalization tubes or perforated tympanic membranes), an open exchange of air occurs between the ear canal and middle ear; thus, any contraction of the stapedius muscle cannot be measured.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe tympanic membrane is an oval, thin, semi-transparent membrane that separates the external and middle ear (tympanic cavity). The tympanic membrane is divided into 2 parts: the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The manubrium of the malleus is firmly attached to the medial tympanic membrane; where the manubrium draws the tympanic membrane medially, a concavity is formed. The apex of this concavity is called the umbo. The area of the tympanic membrane superior to the umbo is termed the pars flaccida; the remainder of the tympanic membrane is the pars tensa (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTympanic membrane (TM): pars flaccida (superior to insertion manubrium) and pars tensa (remainder of TM). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe eighth cranial nerve (CN VIII) or vestibulocochlear nerve is composed of 2 different sets of fibers: (1) the cochlear nerve and (2) the vestibular nerve. These 2 nerves are anatomically and physiologically different. The peripheral segments of the cochlear and vestibular nerves join at the lateral part of the internal auditory canal (IAC) to form the vestibulocochlear nerve. They are also joined by the facial nerve in the IAC. The length of the vestibulocochlear nerve, from the glial-Schwann junction to the brainstem, is 10-13 mm in the human male and 7-10 mm in females.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy and Auditory System Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Labyrinthectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nLabyrinthectomy is an effective surgical procedure for the management of poorly compensated unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction in the presence of a nonserviceable hearing ear.\n [1, 2] Relief from vertigo is achieved at the expense of the residual hearing in the ear to be operated. Hence, the procedure is reserved for patients with nonserviceable hearing.\n\n\nThe basic principle of labyrinthectomy is to symmetrically open all the semicircular canals and vestibules; the landmarks should be preserved until the end of labyrinthectomy. After exposing all the ampullae and vestibules, the five individual groups of neurosensory epithelia are excised under direct visualization.\n [3] This is performed to eliminate abnormal vestibular input from the diseased ear.\n [4] See the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\nInner ear.

Transcanal labyrinthectomy\n [5] is an effective treatment option for the management of poorly compensated unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction in the presence of ipsilateral, profound, or severe sensorineural hearing loss. The modern transcanal labyrinthectomy for the management of unilateral peripheral dysfunction was introduced in the 1950s by Schuknecht\n [6] and Cawthrone.\n [2, 7] \n\nTranscanal labyrinthectomy has several advantages, including the following\n [2, 8] :\n\n\n\n\n\nLess invasive than transmastoid labyrinthectomy\n\n\n\n\nDirect approach to vestibular end organ\n\n\n\n\nShorter operating time than transmastoid labyrinthectomy\n\n\n\n\nLower morbidity than transmastoid labyrinthectomy\n\n\n\nHowever, this approach does have some disadvantages.\n [8, 4] Transcanal exposure is limited as compared to that in transmastoid labyrinthectomy. There is a significant incidence of incomplete labyrinthectomy in the hands of an inexperienced surgeon. In addition, reaching the ampulla of posterior semicircular canal is difficult because this maneuver is performed with blind probing.\n\nIndications\nLabyrinthectomy is indicated for poorly compensated unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction in the presence of a nonserviceable hearing ear.\n\nVestibular disorder should be given appropriate medical treatment before labyrinthectomy. Rehabilitative vestibular therapy also should be attempted before labyrinthectomy.\n\nLabyrinthectomy should be done only in cases with unilateral vestibular dysfunction with ipsilateral severe hearing loss.\n\nAlternative techniques for labyrinth destruction should be considered in young healthy individuals and in patients with bilateral vestibulocochlear disorder.\n [4] \n\nIndications for the transmastoid approach include the following\n [1] {ref913-INVALID REFERENCE}:\n\n\n\n\n\nDelayed onset of vertigo syndrome\n\n\n\n\nPosttraumatic vestibular dysfunction\n\n\n\n\nUnilateral Meniere disease\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nTranscanal labyrinthectomy failures\n\n\n\nContraindications\nLabyrinthectomy is contraindicated when the affected ear is the only hearing ear.

        "Laryngotracheal Reconstruction": "\nBackground\n\n\nSubglottic stenosis (SGS) is a condition of the neonate's or infant's upper airway that is caused by either abnormally small development of the cricoid ring section (congenital) or through injury that is the direct or indirect result of trauma and inflammation (acquired). SGS dramatically increased in the mid-20th century following the development of neonatal ICUs (NICUs) and ventilator support of premature infants using endotracheal intubation for prolonged periods of support. Today, acquired SGS remains the most serious acquired airway abnormality in the pediatric population from prolonged intubation.\n [1] \nPremature infants who developed significant SGS in the past most often required tracheotomy tube placement, followed by a prolonged period of weaning from elevated oxygen levels as their pulmonary status improved. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubglottic stenosis in patient requiring tracheostomy.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nFor many decades, SGS was not able to be corrected by a surgical procedure. Now, through laryngotracheal reconstruction, surgeons can enlarge the narrowed segment of the infant's trachea and achieve successful removal of the tracheotomy tube. This surgical advancement was finally attained by the collective work of numerous surgeons who developed open surgical repair of the injured cricoid and tracheal rings. This procedure has been named laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) or laryngotracheoplasty.\n\n\n\n\nLTR was developed in the 1960s and 1970s by numerous prominent surgeons working in Europe, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent were Drs. Bertel Grahne, John Evans, George Buchanan Todd, Blaire Fearon, and Robin Cotton.\n [2] They designed LTR as an operation that increases the airway lumen by splitting the narrowed segment of cartilaginous rings and then suturing harvested cartilage grafts to increase the lumen’s diameter of the trachea. Successful LTR thereby creates a larger airway and improves and often alleviates the airway obstruction, allowing for the tracheotomy tube to be removed and the child to be decannulated.\n\n\n\n\nPatients require LTR because of laryngeal or tracheal stenosis, complete atresia, or in rare cases severe tracheomalacia after tracheostomy. SGS, or severe narrowness of the airway, can be either congenital or acquired. Congenital stenosis occurs from failed recannulation of the airway during embryonic development. Acquired stenosis is the result of an inflammatory process or insult from the endotracheal tube.\n\nBalloon dilation of the airway can be performed prior to open airway surgery. See the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembranous subglottic stenosis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalloon dilation for membranous subglottic stenosis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-dilation subglottic stenosis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPathophysiology\nCongenital SGS is considered to be congenital in absence of acquired causes of stenosis or a history of endotracheal intubation. Congenital SGS has 2 main types: membranous and, more commonly, cartilaginous. The membranous type is a soft-tissue thickening of the subglottis caused by hyperplastic mucous glands with no inflammatory reaction or increased fibrous connective tissue. The cartilaginous types are more varied in etiology but most commonly involve a thickening or deformity of the cricoid cartilage such as an overly elliptical cricoid cartilage.\n [3] \n\nAcquired SGS is typically caused through injury that is the direct or indirect result of trauma and inflammation such as endotracheal intubation. The pathophysiology of acquired SGS secondary to prolonged endotracheal intubation is well described. Endotracheal tube intubation causes pressure necrosis and subsequent mucosal edema and ulceration at the point of contact with the tissue. As this edema and ulceration progresses, normal ciliary flow is interrupted, which leads to secondary infection and perichondritis. With further infection, cartilage necrosis occurs. This necrosis and ulceration heals by secondary intention and causes formation of granulation tissue and deposition of fibrous tissue in the submucosa, leading to narrowing of the endolarynx. Additionally, repeated intubations cause increased mechanical mucosal trauma and greater amounts of inflammatory response and scar tissue formation, leading to SGS.\n [3] \n\nThe tracheal narrowing can involve several segments of the airway, may be secondary to complete tracheal rings, and can be either firm or soft, circumferential or longitudinal, smooth or irregular, mature or immature. The Cotton-Myer grading system is used to measure the severity of subglottic or tracheal stenosis and is determined with endotracheal tubes demonstrating a leak.\n [4] The grading system is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade 1 – 0-50% obstruction\n\n\n\n\nGrade 2 – 51-70% obstruction\n\n\n\n\nGrade 3 – 71-99% obstruction\n\n\n\n\nGrade 4 – No detectable lumen\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

        "Laser Vaporization of Mouth Lesions": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nLaser vaporization offers a precise means of treating mouth lesions that reduces the potential for pain and scarring. Oral lesions treated with laser surgery include aphthous ulcers, lymphangiomas, hemangiomas, and verrucous carcinomas.\n [1] \n\n\nA laser consists, in essence, of a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) that, when excited with a source of energy, releases particles in the free state. These are then reexcited and exponentially increase in intensity, emitting the excess energy in the form of light. This light is directed between 2 reflecting surfaces or mirrors, one of which is partially transparent to the light and functions as the output channel. (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 laser. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a medium—which can be gas, liquid, solid, or free particle—is stimulated by an energy source in a controlled and methodical manner, the light emitted is of a single wavelength particular to the medium (ie, monochromatic) and is intense or high energy, coherent (travels in a constant phase in time and space), and collimated (travels in the same direction). Such properties enable the light beam to penetrate tissue in order to incise the tissue, seal blood vessels and nerves, and char and vaporize diseased tissue.\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern of laser output may be continuous or pulsed. If the excitation is sustained for more than 0.1 second, a continuous beam of light is produced, and if the stimulation is interrupted at intervals of 0.05 to 0.5 seconds, a pulsed output occurs. Either of these modalities can be used, depending on the requirements of the surgical procedure. A pulsed laser delivers higher peak power, measured in joules (watts per second) than does a continuous wave laser, the energy of which is measured in watts. The high power densities of a pulsed laser produce nonthermal interactions with tissue, which is a useful adjunct to the primary purpose for which the laser is used (eg, in lithotripsy procedures).\n\nQ switch is a mechanism used to deliver a pulsed beam, and this provides energy at much higher densities and longer duration, but also with greater frequency, thus optimizing the laser output.\n\nEffects of laser on tissue\nLaser light interacts with tissue to cause thermal, chemical, or mechanical effects. The thermal effects of laser cutting, coagulation, and vaporization are made use of in the majority of laser applications at settings of 25 to 100 watts.\n\nThe chemical uses of laser are seen in photodynamic therapy in which a photosensitizer drug concentrates in neoplastic tissue and is then activated with laser light to release free oxygen radicals that destroy the abnormal tissue. Photodynamic therapy, or phototherapy, can be administered topically or parenterally. The mechanical effects of laser are utilized in the removal of tattoos and in lithotripsy procedures (eg, the removal of salivary stones).\n\nCertain laser effects are not yet clearly understood, as in the case of low-level laser exposure (0 to 500 milliwatts) with light-emitting diodes, which has been used effectively to treat aphthous ulcers and stomatitis.\n [2, 3] \n\nAll the above effects of laser are dependent on the type of laser used, as well as on the type of tissue, since a particular tissue may transmit, absorb, scatter or reflect the laser light.\n\nTransmission of energy does not have any effect on the tissue but can result in damage to deeper structures.\n\nThe tendency of tissue to absorb laser energy determines the final effect of the laser. Different wavelengths are absorbed to various extents by different types of tissue, causing the tissue to disintegrate due to heat, chemical reaction, or mechanical disruption.\n\nScattering of laser energy may result in collateral, nonthermal damage to surrounding tissue, while the reflection of a laser beam can lead to effects outside the body of the patient, as in airway fires and injury to operating room personnel.\n\nThe thermal effects of laser, which occur at 60-65ºC, are the most commonly used. At these temperatures, protein denaturation occurs, along with disturbance of deeper structural integrity and visible blanching of the tissue. At 100ºC, vaporization of water inside the cells takes place, with vacuole formation, cratering, and tissue shrinkage occurring. Breakdown into elemental carbon, with formation of gas and smoke, occurs at temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius.\n\nImmediately surrounding a laser-ablated tissue region is an area of heat necrosis in which small vessels, nerves and lymphatic channels are sealed; this is why there is a relative absence of bleeding, pain, and edema in laser-operated lesions. Over the long run, this also means that fibrosis and scarring are greatly reduced in laser wounds.\n\nPulsed lasers, by virtue of the extremely brief periods with which they interact with tissue, cause less thermal damage, because the heat is not as readily absorbed into the surrounding areas.\n\nComparative studies between wounds inflicted by laser and those made with cold steel have revealed that laser wounds initially suffer delayed healing and weakness of repair for up to 3 weeks, but that after a month, the wound results for laser and steel are indistinguishable.\n\nBenefits of laser surgery\nThe advantages of laser must be given special mention, especially those of the CO2 laser, which is used extensively by otolaryngologists for treating mouth lesions. The first, and most important, advantage is precision up to 0.1 mm when the CO2 laser is coupled to a micromanipulator, a degree of accuracy that is difficult to achieve with cold instruments. Although this is more pertinent in microscopic laryngeal surgery, it is useful in mouth lesions for ensuring clean and clear margins. (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicromanipulator. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nVaporization of small lesions with laser would not normally yield any tissue specimen for biopsy purposes, but using the laser with the smallest spot size possible can preserve tissue from even tiny lesions for histopathologic examination. Even multiple or \"field-mapping\" biopsies can be harvested from suspected areas of cancerization within the oral cavity, and a follow-up maintained.\n [4] \n\nExcisional biopsies of oral mucosal lesions may be performed with other lasers, although in one study, the CO2 laser was found to cause less thermal damage in such procedures than did the diode laser.\n [5] \n\nThe second advantage of laser surgery is hemostasis, since the CO2 laser can coagulate vessels that are between 0.5 and 2 mm in diameter (although it is recommended that vessels of wider caliber, ie, 1-2 mm, be clamped and ligated).\n\nOther significant advantages of laser surgery are a great reduction in postsurgical swelling and a near absence of pain, due to sealing of lymphatics and nerves, respectively. Moreover, scarring is greatly reduced, and wounds heal without much complication.\n\nDisadvantages of laser surgery\nThe disadvantages of laser surgery are mainly attributable to complications, which are discussed later in the article. Other relative drawbacks are the infrastructure required to provide laser surgery, which can push up treatment costs, and the steep learning curve that surgeons have to go through to achieve competence, and then mastery, of laser procedures.\n\nAlso, as in conventional surgery, lasers have not been found to reduce the relapse rate of dysplastic lesions, although the CO2 laser is used by otolaryngologists and dentists alike to treat dysplastic hyperkeratotic lesions of the mouth.\n [6] \n\nIndications\nIndications for the use of laser are the same as those for scalpel surgery, since laser is simply a different modality for the surgical treatment of various lesions. Lasers can be employed for the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nBiopsies - Incisional or excisional\n\n\n\n\nDebulking of tumors\n\n\n\n\nDissection and coagulation\n\n\n\n\nResurfacing\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring and reconstruction\n\n\n\n\nProviding access channels\n\n\n\nFor all of the above, laser might be the preferred choice for surgery, provided that the surgeon has the skill and experience for handling this medium. Laser would definitely be indicated in cases in which hemostasis and prevention of postoperative edema are of the utmost concern, as in the treatment of vascular lesions.\n\nPain relief is almost instantaneous and more sustained with laser, thus reducing the need for excessive medication. Therefore, another indication for laser use would be the presence of a medical comorbidity, such as asthma, renal impairment, or acid-peptic disease, that precludes or limits the prescription of painkillers.\n\nAlthough more relevant for cutaneous lesions, and not for otolaryngology, laser is also indicated in cases in which scarring is undesirable, since laser wounds heal almost without any scar formation.\n\nCommon indications for the use of laser in the treatment of mouth lesions are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nAphthous ulcers and lichen planus\n\n\n\n\nEpulides, mucoceles, dysplastic hyperkeratosis, and granulomas\n\n\n\n\nLymphangioma, hemangioma, and telangiectasia\n\n\n\n\nPremalignant lesions, as in leukoplakia\n [7] and erythroplakia\n\n\n\n\nRemoval of benign tumors\n\n\n\n\nSuperficial T1 verrucous carcinoma\n\n\n\n\nT1 and limited T2 tongue cancer\n\n\n\n\nDebulking of large tumors\n\n\n\n\nOne-stage tongue release to improve speech and swallowing after composite resection with a tongue flap\n\n\n\n\nFrenectomies (of the lip, tongue, or cheek)\n\n\n\n\nSalivary gland diseases (lithotripsy, intraglandular abscess, transient sialadenitis)\n\n\n\n\nSoft palate surgery (laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty [LAUP], tongue-base reduction [sleep surgery])\n\n\n\n\nTonsillar surgery (mucosa-intact laser tonsillar ablation [MILTA])\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2011 report, laser phototherapy was used successfully to treat intraoral lesions in a pediatric patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n [8] \n\nContraindications\nThere are no contraindications specifically for laser surgery, except when surgical proficiency and safety are compromised. The usual contraindications for conventional surgery hold good for laser procedures, especially in the case of coagulopathies. Considerable time and effort go into setting up the laser equipment and ensuring safety, and this could be a bane when excessive bleeding is a distinct possibility. Even in the absence of a coagulation problem, laser surgery has not been conclusively proven to be superior to scalpel surgery.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nLasers are potentially dangerous devices and may even cause fatal accidents. The manufacturing and distribution of medical lasers, because they are in class 4, are overseen in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nAll institutions, professional bodies, and private practitioners are expected to conform to guidelines formulated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), published in the American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers in Health Care Facilities.\n [9] Any injury, major or minor, should be reported to the relevant Occupational Safety and Health Administration. All data regarding such injuries must be documented as accurately as possible.\n\nComplication prevention\nThe dangers and complications associated with laser surgery arise from the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nLaser plume\n\n\n\n\nPerforation of blood vessel or viscus\n\n\n\n\nAir embolism\n\n\n\n\nUndesirable effects of reflected laser energy\n\n\n\nLaser plume\n\nLaser vaporization of tissue understandably produces smoke, leading to environmental contamination, with CO2 lasers producing the maximum amount of smoke and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers producing much less. This smoke, or plume, has the typical odor of charred tissue that is bound to cause a degree of revulsion to anyone or everyone in the operating room and may even lead to somatic manifestations such as headache, nausea and lacrimation.\n\nThe laser plume is also laden with biological elements such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may theoretically lead to genetic mutations and neoplastic changes. Viral DNA from laryngeal papillomas, known to be caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), have yet to be detected, although genital warts and condylomas caused by the same have yielded viral DNA. Noninfectious DNA from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has also been found, and so also from bacterial spores. No tumor cell DNA has yet been isolated from a laser plume. Thus, while it is possible that the laser plume can cause disease transmission, no case has been documented so far.\n\nMuch of the plume can be removed with a smoke evacuator, but some still remains suspended in the air and may be avoided with the use of face masks capable of filtering ultramicroscopic particles. These masks should be fresh and dry in order to function optimally.\n\nPerforation of blood vessel or viscus\n\nThe high-energy concentration of a laser beam may lead to perforation of viscus or blood vessels. Large vessels (greater than 5 mm) cannot be coagulated with a laser, so conventional ligation has to be done. Potentially fatal complications such as pneumothorax have occurred, and strict vigilance is required in the intraoperative, perioperative, and postoperative stages.\n\nAir embolism\n\nThe gas coolant used with lasers has been reported to have caused lethal embolism into the venous circulation, especially with the Nd:YAG laser (although it has also happened, very rarely, with the CO2 laser). Saline as a coolant is advised when using a laser in body cavities, but this has the other undesirable effect of causing a fluid overload.\n\nFortunately, these problems are hardly encountered in the vaporization of mouth lesions with the CO2 laser. Nevertheless, continuous and careful monitoring of the airway and blood gases is mandatory during the use of CO2 laser with general anaesthesia, to promptly detect and treat any incidence of embolization and hypercapnia.\n\nUndesirable effects of reflected laser energy\n\nThe untoward effects of reflected laser light call attention to the need for the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecautions against fire\n\n\n\n\nWet gauze or fireproof material to shield the patient\n\n\n\n\nProtection of the anesthetic tubes and airway\n\n\n\n\nEye protection for the operator\n\n\n\nThe risk of fires is preempted by appropriate preparations and modifications in the operating room, as described earlier. The patient is protected by maximal coverage with wet or nonflammable drapes, and wet packs are kept inside the body cavity (in this case, the oral cavity) and around the endotracheal tube to minimize collateral risk of thermal injury and airway fire. (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection of exposed tissues. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn the event of an airway fire, ventilation must be suspended, the affected material removed as quickly and carefully as possible, and jet ventilation and oxygenation with mask instituted. Conventional surgery may be performed to complete the procedure, and in the event of considerable upper airway injury, a low tracheotomy may have to be done. In more serious cases, critical care with mechanical ventilation might be necessary.\n\nSafety glasses with optical properties compatible with the laser being used must be worn by the patient and the operating surgeon, as well as by the rest of the operating room personnel. This is important for visible lasers, such as the argon and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) lasers, in which the laser beam is not absorbed by the ocular fluids and can traverse the globe to cause a retinal burn. Tinted glasses, which may have to be used with these lasers, may cause difficulties during surgery, because they somewhat obscure tissue color characteristics. Moreover, the glasses must have a wraparound design so that lateral or tangential entry of the laser light beam is preempted.\n\nThe energy beam from a CO2 laser is easily absorbed by the water-rich tissues of the eyeball and can result in a burn and in subsequent scarring of the cornea and lens. Ordinary glass or plastic lenses are adequate for the CO2 laser; glass is more protective for the wearer but more threatening for the other staff, since glass tends to reflect the laser beam somewhat.\n\nThe patient is strictly instructed to keep his or her eyes closed, and then protective glasses are worn, over which wet cotton or gauze pads are placed. Hair must be tied snugly back and covered with a cap to prevent it from accidentally catching fire.\n\nPatient Education\nPatient education includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPreoperative counseling to explain to the patient the advantages of the surgery under laser, as well as the potential risks\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of the costs involved\n\n\n\n\nThe possibility of completing the surgery with conventional methods in case of laser failure, or of aborting the procedure in case of a serious complication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Lip Biopsy": "\nOverview\n\n\nLip biopsy may be necessary to identify the histopathology of a visible oral lesion or to assist in the diagnosis of a systemic disorder.\nIf a lesion is noted on the lip or oral mucosa, incisional or excisional biopsy is clinically indicated if concern for malignancy exists. Findings such as red or white discoloration, induration or fixation to deeper tissues, rapid growth, friability, or ulceration should raise concerns for malignancy. Some advocate monitoring a lesion for 2 weeks after any irritants are eliminated, to allow for any inflammatory or irritative lesions to resolve. If a lesion does not respond to this conservative management, then biopsy is indicated.\n\n\nLip biopsy (specifically the minor salivary glands of the lip) may also be used to assist in the diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome, a chronic autoimmune disorder involving the destruction of glandular tissue. The glandular tissues involved include both minor and major salivary glands and the lacrimal gland. Other systemic disorders, such as sarcoidosis, amyloid polyneuropathy, and neonatal hemochromatosis may be confirmed with a lip biopsy.\n [1] \nPunch biopsy and scalpel biopsy may also be of assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Management of Erythematous Oral Lesions": "\nOverview\n\n\nMany conditions can cause oral erythema, including localized trauma, infection, contact allergy, cancer, and other causes of inflammatory changes, as well as systemic diseases such as those that produce vesiculoerosive lesions or oral ulceration. For purposes of this discussion, which involves therapy for oral erythematous lesions, the presented conditions are arbitrarily divided into the following categories: local infection, contact allergy, oral cancer, and localized vesiculoerosive and ulcerative disease.\n [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] \nSee Clues in the Oral Cavity: Are You Missing the Diagnosis?, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify the causes of abnormalities of the oral cavity.\n\n\nThis article focuses on dental management of oral erythema, but, in cases of systemic disease, a more comprehensive medical approach to therapy is necessary. For a complete description of each condition discussed in this article, including etiology, epidemiology, signs and symptoms, and diagnosis, the reader is encouraged to assess the published literature.\nThe general rationale for dental treatment of oral erythematous lesions is to relieve symptoms, to prevent problems that arise from the disease (eg, secondary infection, tissue morbidity), and to support the patient’s general health.\n [13] \n\n\n\n\nFor all the conditions listed below, home care should be an integral component of therapy and should include recommendations for fluid and nutritional support, adequate rest, and over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed pain control. In cases involving severe disease or worsening symptoms in the face of initial intervention, medical referral and comanagement should be recommended, with patient follow-up by appointment or phone to prevent potential systemic complications or morbidity due to patient noncompliance or other patient reasons for a lack of follow-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Mandibulectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nMandibulectomy is a procedure that is used to eradicate disease that involves the lower jaw or mandible. This procedure can be used in various settings, including infectious etiologies (eg, osteomyelitis), osteoradionecrosis, or a benign (eg, ameloblastoma) or malignant neoplastic process (eg, invasive squamous cell carcinoma) that involves the jaw. In cases of severe oral and maxillofacial trauma, if a section of the mandible is not salvageable, mandibulectomy may be an appropriate treatment.\nIn the last several years, the incidence of bisphosphonate-related necrosis of the mandible has increased, leading to the need for mandibulectomy to remove the affected section of mandible.\n [1] \n\n\nIt is important to differentiate the different types of mandibulectomy. Depending on the thickness of the native mandible and the specific disease process, the mandibulectomy can either be full thickness (segmental), in which both cortices in addition to the upper and lower surfaces of the mandible are removed en bloc, or partial thickness, in which either the inner or outer cortex of the mandible is spared in order to maintain some mandibular continuity (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\nFull-thickness resection of the left mandible body and parasymphysis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the degree of bone resection, it must allow the surgeon to encompass the involved disease process.

        "Mastoidectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe mastoid, along with the tympanic, squamous, and petrous bones, form the temporal bone. A number of critical structures are either located within or traverse through the temporal bone. The temporal bone is located between the occipital bone posteriorly, the parietal bone superiorly, the sphenoid bone anterior medially, and the soft tissues of the neck inferiorly. The mastoid has a cortical osseous covering of varying thickness and is filled with very thin osseous septations, which form an air cell system similar in appearance to the ethmoid paranasal sinus.\n\n\nA simple mastoidectomy consists of opening the mastoid cortex and identifying the aditus ad antrum.\nA complete or canal wall up mastoidectomy necessitates removal of all of the mastoid air cells along the tegmen, sigmoid sinus, presigmoid dural plate, and posterior wall of the external auditory canal. The posterior wall of the external auditory canal is preserved.\n\n\n\n\nA canal wall down mastoidectomy includes a complete mastoidectomy in addition to removal of the posterior and superior osseous external auditory canal. The tympanic membrane is reconstructed to separate the mucosal lined middle ear space from the mastoid cavity and ear canal.\n\n\n\n\nA modified radical mastoidectomy is identical to a canal wall down mastoidectomy except the middle ear space and native tympanic membrane are not manipulated. This procedure is useful when there is no extension of cholesteatoma in the middle ear space or medial to the malleus head or incus body. This procedure is often indicated in patients with a cholesteatoma in their only or better hearing ear.\n\nA radical mastoidectomy is a canal wall down mastoidectomy in which the tympanic membrane and ossicles are not reconstructed, thus exteriorizing the middle ear and the mastoid. The eustachian tube is often obliterated with soft tissue to reduce the risk of a chronic otorrhea. A skin graft can be placed in the middle ear to reduce the risk of mucosalization and otorrhea.\n [1, 2] \n\nKey considerations\nSuccessful and safe mastoid surgery requires routine identification of key anatomic structures including but not limited to the tegmen (middle fossa floor), sigmoid sinus, external auditory canal, lateral semicircular canal, and facial nerve.\n\nA high-speed electric or pneumatic drill with various tools and attachments are used in conjunction with copious suction irrigation when performing mastoid surgery. Adequate irrigation serves to wash away bone dust generated by the drill to improve visualization. Irrigation also decreases the risk of injury from overheating of various structures traversing the temporal bone.\n\nThe operating microscope with various magnification setting provides the surgeon with improved visualization of anatomic landmarks and critical structures traversing the temporal bone.\n\nIndications\nChronic otitis media (COM), with or without cholesteatoma, is one of the more common indications for performing a mastoidectomy. Patients with chronic otitis media often present with otorrhea and progressive hearing loss. Mastoidectomy permits access to remove cholesteatoma matrix or diseased air cells. In addition, mastoidectomy often provides access to the temporal bone which are more challenging to visualize through the external auditory canal (ie, supratubal recess, epitympanum, facial recess, perilabyrinthine air cells, retrofacial air cells).\n\nMastoidectomy is one of the key steps in placing a cochlear implant to rehabilitate acquired or congenital sensorineural hearing loss. A mastoidectomy allows the surgeon access to the middle ear through the facial recess. The implant electrode array is placed through the facial recess into a cochleostomy, which is drilled inferior and slightly anterior to the round window.\n\nA mastoidectomy is often an initial step in removal of lateral skull base neoplasms, including vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, temporal bone paragangliomas (glomus tumors), and epidermoids.\n\nComplications of otitis media, including intratemporal or intracranial suppuration and lateral venous sinus thrombosis, often necessitate a mastoidectomy.\n [3] \n\nContraindications\nContraindications are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients with medical conditions precluding general anesthesia.\n\n\n\n\nPatients with a poorly pneumatized mastoid (sclerotic) may make surgery more complicated, as certain anatomic landmarks may be more challenging to identify (otic capsule, facial nerve). \n\n\n\n\nSurgeons should proceed with caution in patients with anterior displacement of the sigmoid sinus and a low mastoid or middle ear tegmen (roof). These anatomic variants can be identified preoperatively with a temporal bone CT scan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Maxillectomy": "\nPre-Procedure\n\n\nBackground\nConceptually described by Lazars in 1826, a maxillectomy was not successfully performed until 1828 by Syme.\n [1] Early maxillectomy attempts were unsuccessful primarily because of excessive blood loss. Its high mortality and secondary deformity led to the widespread adoption of irradiation as the preferred treatment for cancers of the maxilla.\n\n\nIn 1927, Portman and Retrouvey described a sublabial-transoral approach that obviated scarring from external incisions, such as a lateral rhinotomy or Weber-Ferguson.\n [2] Around the 1950s, advancements in anesthesia, blood replacement, and further improvements of the surgical technique propelled the popularity of the radical maxillectomy. During the 1970s, the midfacial degloving approach, which obviated the need for facial incisions in select patients, also gained popularity.\n [3] Combined treatments, including preoperative or postoperative external beam radiation, led to a modest increase in survival.\nMultiple modifications and extensions were subsequently described to better suit the individual oncologic needs. In 1954, Smith described the extended maxillectomy,\n [4] which was associated with improved cancer survival rates (55%).\n [5] As the surgical experience expanded, a maxillectomy was combined with skull base resections to address tumors of the pterygoid plate, anterior skull base, or posterior extension toward the nasopharynx. In 1961, Fairbanks-Barbosa was the first to report an infratemporal fossa (ITF) approach for advanced tumors of the maxillary sinus.\n [6] This extended approach and its subsequent modifications helped to improve cancer survival rates, as previously unresectable tumors were now amenable to a complete resection. However, they also resulted in higher postoperative mortality rates, frequently from meningitis.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nIn 1977, Sessions and Larson\n [8] coined the term \"medial maxillectomy\" to describe a partial maxillectomy indicated for benign and malignant lesions of the lateral nasal wall. Although initially described with a lip-splitting technique, many authors subsequently described modifications which obviated this extension. As endoscopic sinus surgery continued to advance, it was not long until an endoscopic medial maxillectomy was described.\n [9] This technique offered superior visualization and resulted in favorable recurrence rates when compared to external approaches.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nCurrently, endoscopic endonasal resection of tumors confined to the lateral nasal wall is standard at most institutions. Open transfacial or transoral techniques are still widely employed for maxillary tumors necessitating total or near total maxillectomy. Open approaches are also used to access some skull base and nasopharyngeal tumors.\n\nIndications\nSurgical excision of tumors involving the maxilla is the main indication for a maxillectomy. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy requiring maxillectomy. However, various other tumors, either benign or malignant tumors and originating from bone, minor salivary glands, or dental tissues among others, are also seen. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for most maxillary sinus lesions, with the exception of malignancies that are highly responsive to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, such as lymphoreticular malignancies (eg, lymphoma) and pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas, or when dealing with advanced disease when no gain in life expectancy or quality of life is expected. Combined treatments, adding adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, are commonly advocated, particularly in advanced stages or aggressive pathologies.\n\nA total or complete maxillectomy, however, is not always required. Tumors originating or involving the inferior aspect of the maxillary sinus may be treated by a partial maxillectomy in which only the inferior aspect of the sinus is removed, thus preserving the malar complex, inferior orbital rim, and orbital floor. The precise limits of the resection must be determined by the extent of the tumor. Similarly, tumors isolated to the medial maxillary wall (such as inverted papilloma) are frequently treated with a medial maxillectomy (endoscopic or open). A maxillectomy may also be performed as part of a combined resection of a skull base or nasopharyngeal neoplasm. Rarely, a maxillectomy may be required to treat infectious (eg, invasive fungal infection, chronic osteomyelitis) or chronic granulomatous diseases.\n\nContraindications\nThe decision to perform surgery depends on the extent of the tumor and the patient's general health, comorbidities, life expectancy, and wishes. Absolute contraindications to a maxillectomy include patient’s refusal to provide consent, lymphoreticular tumors that are best treated by nonsurgical means, or a patient who cannot tolerate surgery due to very poor general condition.\n\nKey Considerations\nTumors of the maxillary sinus are diverse and may be benign or malignant and of varied origin, primarily arising in the sinonasal tract or extending into it by contiguous spread from the oral cavity, orbit, nasopharynx, skull base, or overlying skin. Evaluation of patients with tumors of the maxillary sinus requires the identification of the tumor site of origin, extent, and histological differentiation. Proper evaluation of the preoperative imaging is paramount to obtain complete tumor resection. There is a significant correlation between the tumor extent on imaging and the incidence of positive margins, particularly when the tumor extends dorsally or cranially.\n [11] \n\nThese factors, along with the patient’s co-morbidities and experience of the surgical team, guide the treatment paradigm. A multidisciplinary team, often consisting of otolaryngologists, oral surgeons, neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, dentists, prosthodontists, and speech pathologists, is critical to obtain an adequate diagnosis, stage and remove the tumor, reconstruct resulting cosmetic defects, and rehabilitate functional deficits.\n\nPresentation\nMost tumors of the maxillary sinus are “silent” until they reach an advanced stage, producing no direct symptoms; therefore, patients often present with symptoms arising from obstruction of the sinus ostium or nasal airway, invasion of the orbit, alteration of dentition, ill-fitting dentures or involvement of the trigeminal nerve (motor or sensory; see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnterior rhinoscopy demonstrating a tumor causing complete nasal obstruction. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nSecondary effects are primarily based on the origin and extent of the tumor; thus, inferior tumors present with more dental symptoms (pain, malocclusion, loose dentition, ill-fitting dentures), nasal wall tumors with nasal symptoms (congestion, epistaxis, epiphora), superior tumors with orbital symptoms (proptosis, diplopia, decreased acuity, or infraorbital nerve involvement), posterior tumors with ear symptoms (decreased hearing, otalgia) or trismus secondary to eustachian tube or pterygoid involvement, and tumors with lateral extension present with facial swelling, pain, and trismus.\n\nIncreasingly, tumors are identified incidentally due to the widespread use of CT scanning and MRI for evaluation of other symptoms.\n\nSimilarly, findings during the physical examination are primarily based on the origin and biologic behavior of the disease. Facial, palatal, or alveolar ridge masses are seen as the tumor erodes through bone (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntraoral examination demonstrating a tumor eroding through the hard palate. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nErosion of the inferior infrastructure can yield loose dentition. Intraorbital tumor growth leads to proptosis and/or alteration of extraocular movements. Hypesthesia of the infraorbital nerve can also occur. Posterior extension can manifest as serous otitis, trismus, or abducens neuropathy. Endonasal examination may reveal a nasal mass (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal endoscopy showing a friable tumor of the lateral nasal wall. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nAs with any surgical procedure, a thorough knowledge of the pertinent anatomy is required and best obtained through cadaveric dissections, courses, and mentored surgery. Great variability exists between individuals and even between separate sides of the same patient, as the sinuses develop from variable pneumatization of solid bone.\n\nThe maxillary sinus is a 6-sided box that is wider anteriorly than posteriorly. Its lateral wall and floor are thicker than its anterior, posterior, superior and medial walls. Pneumatization may extend laterally well into the body of the zygoma and posteriorly into the palatine bone. Hypoplasia and aplasia may occur; however, they are uncommon. The maxillary sinus is lined with pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium, as is the remainder of the nasal cavity except the nasal vestibule and a small portion of the superior nasal cavity. The nasal vestibule, which corresponds to the ala of the nose, is lined with squamous epithelium, which contains vibrissae, sweat, and sebaceous glands. Olfactory epithelium lines a small part of the superior portion of the nasal cavity (bound by the superior turbinate laterally and the nasal septum medially).\n\nSurgical anatomy, as it relates to maxillectomy, should include the discussion of bordering structures, as tumor extensions into these areas most often determines the extent of surgery and need for adjuvant therapy. The superior wall of the maxillary sinus is shared with the orbit, while the pterygoid plates, pterygoid space, and infratemporal fossa are located posterior to the sinus.\n\nOhngren noted that involvement of these superior and posterior areas signifies a poor prognosis.\n [12] He described an imaginary line extending from the medial canthus through the angle of the mandible. Lesions posterior-superior to this line have poorer outcomes than those anterior-inferior to this line, possibly as a result of the relative ease of resecting anterior-inferior lesions en bloc. Other close relationships include the oral cavity, adjacent paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, skull base, and intracranial fossa. By understanding these relationships, one can easily grasp the varied presenting signs and symptoms as they relate to tumors of the maxillary sinus.\n\nTumors can breach the boundaries of the maxilla and enter adjacent structures by either direct invasion/destruction of bone and soft tissue boundaries or along pre-existent anatomic pathways. Extension into the nasal cavity can occur early in the disease process. The nasal cavity is a paired structure separated by the nasal septum. The lateral walls comprise the medial wall of the maxillary sinus as well as the inferior, middle, and superior turbinates.\n\nExtension into the nasal cavity can be manifest by nasal obstruction and/or epistaxis. Superior tumor extension can lead to invasion of the orbit, which may manifest as ocular pain, fullness of the eyelid, unilateral epiphora, extraocular muscle limitation/diplopia, or proptosis. Superior tumor extension frequently compromises the second division of the trigeminal nerve (V2) as it courses through the superior wall of the sinus and exits the infraorbital foramen. The floor of the maxillary sinus corresponds to the hard palate of the oral cavity; therefore, caudal extension of the tumor can present with loose dentition, palatal fullness, pain, and/or ulceration.\n\nAnterior extension can breach the anterior wall of the sinus to involve the overlying skin and soft tissue. This can present as a skin lesion, lymphedema (peau d’orange), or fixation of the skin over the maxilla. Posteriorly lie the pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossae, which are important anatomic areas, as they are densely populated by the mastication muscles, various sensory and motor nerves, and by carotids and other blood vessels that supply the nasal cavity, oral cavity, maxillary teeth, and pharynx.\n\nTumor extension into these areas can present with trismus (from involvement of the pterygoid muscles or motor branches of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve), facial hypesthesia (from involvement of the infraorbital nerve or other sensory branches from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve), pain in the maxillary dentition (from involvement of the anterior, middle, or posterior superior alveolar nerve branches of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve), or severe epistaxis (from involvement of the terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery).\n\nThe pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossae are also potential routes for intracranial tumor spread, via direct extension, preformed pathways, or hematogenous spread. Intracranial involvement increases the risk of spontaneous or postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, and intracranial abscess. Further, posterior to the maxillary sinus, the eustachian tubes open into the nasopharynx. Tumor extension into this region may obstruct the eustachian tube and lead to secondary serous otitis media, hence, manifesting as hearing loss.\n\nPreparation\nAnesthesia\n\nTotal maxillectomy and most of its partial variants are performed under general anesthesia with anesthetic and cardiovascular monitoring appropriate to the patient's condition and extent of the planned resection and reconstruction. Although extreme blood loss is unusual, based on tumor size and location, precautions should be taken for the rapid replacement of blood volume should excessive hemorrhage occurs. Most of the hemorrhage is encountered upon transection of the internal maxillary artery in the infratemporal or pterygopalatine fossae.\n\nAn endoscopic medial maxillectomy does not require anything different from that required for standard sinus surgery anesthesia. Hypotensive anesthesia, if not contraindicated because of patient comorbidities, is helpful in reducing intraoperative blood loss. Avoidance of paralytics is indicated if monitoring of the cranial nerves (EMGs) or brain function (SSEPs) is used. Transoral intubation is preferable, and the endotracheal tube should be secured opposite the side of the tumor on the lower lip, not distorting or tethering the upper lip, which is frequently retracted (and rarely incised) to provide adequate exposure. If direct transoral intubation is not possible or is deemed too risky, an “awake” transnasal fiberoptic intubation should be performed through the opposite nostril. A tracheostomy, under local anesthesia, is a prudent approach in patients with a particularly difficult airway. General anesthesia is induced once the airway is secured.\n\nEquipment\n\nStandard soft tissue and maxillofacial surgery instruments trays are usually adequate to complete a partial or total maxillectomy. A standard endoscopic sinus surgery set-up is used for an endoscopic medial maxillectomy. Reciprocating, sagittal, and oscillating saw blades facilitate the osteotomies, but those over the anterior and lateral walls of the maxilla are best performed with Kerrison rongeurs. This latter technique creates a wide osteotomy that serves as a window to monitor the margins of the resection while avoiding injury of the soft tissues deep to the osteotomy. Similarly, small bone chisels and osteotomes may be used as needed.\n\nPositioning\n\nThe patient is positioned supine on the operating room table and rotated 900 from the anesthesiologist (for a medial maxillectomy) or 1800 for a total maxillectomy. Once the bed is the desired position, the patient’s head is turned slightly toward the side of the tumor to improve exposure. If the orbit is being preserved, a temporary tarsorrhaphy or corneal shield is helpful to protect the eye during open approaches. Taping is usually adequate for endoscopic procedures.\n\nComplication prevention\n\nNo substitute exists for sound surgical technique to prevent complications; however, technique alone cannot eliminate all complications. Broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis is administered prior to the start of the procedure. Clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam are good choices because they cover skin and oral cavity flora. A third generation cephalosporin with good cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration is advocated if a concomitant skull base resection is planned. Any incision should be marked prior to infiltration of local anesthesia because this distorts the tissue and leads to inaccurate placement of the incision or even unsightly scars. During closure, precise realignment is important.\n\nIts proximity puts the orbital contents at risk in all operations of the maxillary sinus. When preserving the orbit, protecting the eye with a temporary tarsorrhaphy or corneal shield is important. Identification of surgical landmarks, such as the lamina papyracea and skull base, is paramount to preserve their integrity during the procedure. Accidental lacerations of the periorbita may cause herniation of fat and result in postoperative enophthalmos. If a significant laceration occurs, it may be repaired using inlay free fascial graft. Epiphora is best prevented by marsupializing the lacrimal sac, dividing it, and suturing its edges to the surrounding soft tissue. A stent can be used to ensure patency, although it is usually not necessary. In addition, the medial canthal ligament should be accurately positioned to avoid misalignment and to optimize the lacrimal pumping mechanism.\n\nPreoperative imaging should be reviewed carefully and the osteotomies planned carefully. An osteotomy superior to the level of the anterior ethmoid artery and frontoethmoid suture may penetrate the cranial cavity and result in intracranial injury or CSF leakage. Dissection that is carried medial to the attachment of the middle turbinate may also produce CSF leakage. Posterior orbital osteotomies and soft tissue transection have the potential for direct injury to the optic nerve or the internal maxillary artery; thus, they should be performed cautiously. All instrumentation needed to control brisk bleeding should be on hand.\n\nA surgical obturator is ideally molded preoperatively so it can be used after the resection to achieve immediate oral/nasal separation. It also helps to pack the cavity, which helps to bolster the skin graft or flap, and lets the patient resume an oral diet in the early postoperative period.\n\nPreoperative evaluation\n\nPreoperative evaluation should include a detailed nasal endoscopy to inspect the intranasal anatomy and examination of the oral cavity, orbit, and cranial nerve function. Establishing the function of the inferior orbital nerve and integrity of the bony walls of the maxillary sinus to determine if the tumor has spread outside its boundaries is important: anteriorly into the soft tissues of the cheek, posterolaterally into the infratemporal fossa, superiorly into the orbit or intracranial fossa, or medially into the nasal cavity.\n\nAll patients are evaluated preoperatively with CT scanning, MRI, or both. CT provides exquisite details of the bony anatomy, and the administration of contrast estimates the tumor vascularity. CT scanning is usually the first choice to image tumors of the maxillary sinus (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT scan of a patient with a maxillary sinus tumor in the axial plane. Note the detailed bony anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nTumor size and true extension, however, can be difficult to assess, as it is difficult to differentiate tumor from retained secretions within the sinuses. MRI better delineates the soft tissues, especially the tumor interfaces, and can distinguish tumor from retained secretions. MRI also may demonstrate perineural spread not evident on CT (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRI of a patient with a maxillary sinus tumor in the axial plane. Note the differentiation of secretions and tumor as well as the evidence of perineural spread. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nHistological confirmation often requires extensive sampling that should be completed prior to surgical excision. Biopsy specimens may be obtained directly transnasally, transorally or, in rare circumstances, through a gingival buccal incision and anterior antrostomy. Excisional biopsy may be justified in some circumstances.\n\nPreoperative evaluation by a maxillofacial prosthodontist allows the design of a surgical obturator, which as previously mentioned can be inserted in immediately after completion of the procedure. A surgical obturator also facilitates the construction of the temporary prosthesis. Communication of the planned extent of resection is essential to the design of the prosthesis. An unplanned extension of the resection may require the addition of acrylic or additional modifications for an effective fit. Extension into the orbit indicates an ophthalmologic consultation to better assess ocular function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Middle Ear Endoscopy": "\nHistory\n\n\nMer, in 1967, was the first to describe use of an endoscope to view the anatomy of the middle ear.\n [1] He initially performed endoscopy through a tympanic membrane incision on cadavers and on a feline model. Endoscopy in human patients was only attempted through previously existing perforations. Despite his initial success, the endoscope had only limited use as an instrument to photograph the tympanic membrane.\nTwo decades would pass before Nomura popularized the idea of a surgical myringotomy in an intact drum to permit endoscopic examination of the middle ear structures.\n [2] Subsequently, direct endoscopy through the middle ear space has been used successfully (1) as an alternate procedure for second-look mastoidectomy, middle ear exploration for perilymphatic fistula, and limited removal of epitympanic cholesteatoma and (2) as an intraoperative aid to visualize the attic, eustachian tube, and sinus tympani. \n\n\nIn 1989, Kimura introduced the concept of endoscopy of the middle ear through the eustachian tube orifice.\n [3] This technique has not met with the same clinical success as transtympanic endoscopy because of the small image size provided by the scope, difficult orientation, and poor illumination. In a recent study, 25% of endoscopy attempts through the eustachian tube orifice were aborted because of local irritation, bleeding, thick mucus, and/or blocked view by bony spicules. Theoretically, when the difficulties of this technique are overcome, it may provide information pertaining to pathologies in the epitympanum, mesotympanum, and mastoid antrum, and it may allow assessment of ossicular chain mobility. For now, however, the authors find only the transtympanic route for middle ear endoscopy to be a clinically viable technique. \nRelevant Anatomy\nThe ear is composed of external, middle (tympanic) (malleus, incus, and stapes), and inner (labyrinth) (semicircular canals, vestibule, cochlea) portions. The auricle and external acoustic meatus (or external auditory canal) compose the external ear. The external ear functions to collect and amplify sound, which then gets transmitted to the middle ear. The tympanic cavity (middle ear) extends from the tympanic membrane to the oval window and contains the bony conduction elements of the malleus, incus, and stapes. The primary functionality of the middle ear is that of bony conduction of sound via transference of sound waves in the air collected by the auricle to the fluid of the inner ear. The inner ear, also called the labyrinthine cavity, is essentially formed of the membranous labyrinth encased in the bony osseus labyrinth. The labyrinthine cavity functions to conduct sound to the central nervous system as well as to assist in balance.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Minimally Invasive Cochlear Implant Surgery": "\nBackground\n\n\nCochlear implantation has become a common method of rehabilitating severely to profoundly deaf children and adults. Standard cochlear implantation requires an extended postauricular and scalp incision and large flap, mastoidectomy, facial recess approach, cochleostomy, and insertion of an electrode into the scala tympani. The most common complications associated with the standard approach to cochlear implantation include flap breakdown and electrode misplacement. \nLimited data concerning minimally invasive techniques have been described in the literature. Generally, such techniques involve a less-extensive incision and less-invasive manner of securing the receiver/stimulator onto the skull or, more recently, the use of image-guided navigation for percutaneous drilling from the surface of the mastoid directly to the cochlea. \n\n\nIn recent years, the standard approach to cochlear implantation with a large incision has been challenged by successful implantation of cochlear implants in numerous patients with a much smaller incision and a less-invasive approach. In addition, CT-guided preoperative planning of the drilling path and intraoperative CT guidance appear promising, which could further reduce the invasiveness of the procedure. However, this technique remains to be proven as comparable in safety and efficacy as the established minimally invasive techniques in Technique. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Minimally Invasive Surgery of the Parathyroid": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nIn the past, parathyroidectomy primarily involved an open procedure with a neck incision, not unlike that used for a thyroidectomy. This procedure required the inspection of all 4 parathyroid glands, with removal of the offending gland or glands. Its major indication was for primary hyperparathyroidism, with usually the largest parathyroid being the suspected cause resulting in its subsequent removal. Eventually, intraoperative physiologic studies improved the likelihood that the offending gland or glands were removed. Concurrently, there has been a push for less invasive procedures, with goals of decreased operative and recovery times, better cosmesis, and decreased complications.\n\n\nThis article discusses minimally procedures for parathyroidectomy (MIP), focusing on minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP).\nEmbryology/Anatomy\nThe parathyroid glands are derived from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. The inferior parathyroids come from the third pharyngeal pouch and follow the descent of the thymus until they rest on the dorsal surface of the thyroid, usually in a plane anterior to the superior parathyroids. In contrast, the superior parathyroids develop from the fourth branchial arch and descend into the neck with the thyroid gland. The inferior thyroid artery usually provides the vascular supply for both the superior and inferior parathyroid glands, although 20% of superior parathyroids may be supplied solely by the superior thyroid artery.\n [1]  In general, the superior parathyroid glands lie in a vertical plane posterior to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, whereas the inferior parathyroid glands are anterior to this nerve. The superior parathyroid glands are generally found 1 cm superior to the intersection of the inferior thyroid artery and the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are usually 2 glands on each side of the thyroid, although 3–7% of the population may have an accessory or supernumerary parathyroid gland, and 3–6% may have fewer than 4 glands. The glands may occasionally descend incompletely or too far and can lie in aberrant locations, including the mediastinum, the bifurcation of the carotids, or in the retroesophageal or retropharyngeal regions. In addition, the relative increased path of descent of the inferior parathyroid glands tend to have a more variable location than the superior parathyroids. Overall, the most common location of aberrant parathyroid glands is in the anterior mediastinum.\n\nOf the possible aberrant locations in which parathyroid glands are found, intrathyroidal parathyroid glands have been described, although there is some controversy surrounding their existence. Some state that these parathyroids are not indeed within the thyroid parenchyma itself but are instead within the thyroid capsule. Others describe true intrathyroidal parathyroids with an incidence of 0.5–3%.\n [1]  \n\nIndications\nThe main indication for a parathyroidectomy is primary hyperparathyroidism. Classically, these patients are referred to an otolaryngologist's practice by either a primary care physician or endocrinologist for surgical intervention.\n\nClassically, patients are described as having signs and symptoms following the mnemonic “bones, stones, groans, and psychiatric overtones”—including skeletal complications (pathologic fractures, osteitis fibrosa cystic, osteoporosis), renal disease (nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, diabetes insipidus, renal failure), gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, nausea, vomiting), and psychiatric (mood swings, depression, psychosis) and central nervous system (lethargy, ataxia, delirium) manifestations.\n [1] \n\nHowever, in modern times the vast majority of patients present with subtle symptoms of fatigue, emotional lability, poor sleep, mental fogginess, and \"aches and pains\" together with elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n [2] \n\nFor these patients with so-called asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism, surgery is indicated when it falls within surgical guidelines by meeting criteria based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) indications: \n\n\n\n\n\n          Serum calcium concentration of 1.0 mg/dl or more above the upper limit of normal \n         \n\n\n\n          T-score at the hip, lumbar spine, or distal radius less than -2.5 or previous vertebral fracture\n         \n\n\n\n          eGFR less than 60 mL/min, 24-hour urinary calcium > 400 mg/day, nephrolithiasis, or nephrocalcinosis\n         \n\n\n\n          Age younger than 50 years\n          \n [3] \n\n\n\nContraindications\nIn the past, radiation exposure to the head and neck has been a listed contraindication to MIP, secondary to the increased risk of multiglandular disease and the possibility of coexisting thyroid cancer.\n [4]  However, a prospective cohort study by Rahbari et al to determine the effectiveness of MIP showed no significant differences between concurrent thyroid diseases, the incidence of multiglandular parathyroid disease, or the eventual operation chosen between the cohort that had a history of head and neck radiation and the cohort that had no exposure to radiation.\n [5] \n\nIt is important to distinguish patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia from patients with true primary hyperparathyroidism, as the first group would not benefit from a parathyroidectomy. A 24-hour urine calcium accomplishes this.\n\nProcedure planning\nAs part of the preoperative planning for MIP, it is essential to localize the offending parathyroid gland. At the authors’ institution, patients may undergo an ultrasound and fused SPECT/CT scan or 4-dimensional CT of the neck.\n\nA meta-analysis by Cheung et al compared various imaging studies to aid with localization. It determined that SPECT had a pooled sensitivity and positive predictive value of 78.9% and 90.7%, respectively, based on 9 studies (range of sensitivities between 61.4% and 100% in analyzed studies). For patients with radiotracer localization to one gland, MIP should be offered, with the caution that a parathyroid exploration may still be necessary based on intraoperative findings.\n [6] \n\nAside from using a radioactive tracer, ultrasound is commonly used to identify parathyroid adenomas, although its use is subject to operator technique and interpretation. Sensitivities ranged from 48.3% to 96.2% in the studies analyzed in the meta-analysis by Cheung et al. The pooled sensitivity and positive predictive value for ultrasound based on 19 studies were 76.1% and 93.2%, respectively.\n [6] \n\nMiyabe described 3-dimensional ultrasonography, which provides coronal images similar to a surgeon’s view. This technique resulted in a lower operative time when compared with traditional 2-dimensional ultrasonography.\n [7] \n\nAnother novel approach described by D'Agostino et al used a 3-dimensional rendering of a CT scan that is then referenced intraoperatively to aid in localization. This process requires that the patient has a CT scan performed preoperatively with neck extension. The rendered scan is then overlaid over a visual image of the patient’s neck in the operating room. A separate technician assists with manipulating the rendered scan as it pertains to the operation. The authors describe a 77.2% and 64.9% accuracy of the CT scan with regard to the correct identification of laterality and location, respectively.\n [8] \n\nFour-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) is another option for preoperative localization of hyperactive and ectopic parathyroid glands.\n [9]  The most commonly utilized method involves a protocol consisting of pre-contrast, early-delayed, and late-delayed phases.\n [10]  This technique utilizes standard multiplanar CT scanning but measures changes in contrast attenuation over time. The reported sensitivity as an initial imaging modality in localizing an adenoma to a quadrant is 60–80%.\n [11]  Furthermore, Brown et al indicated that this technology might also be helpful when an abnormal gland is not identified by sestamibi scanning (in up to 80% of cases) and may be more sensitive than sestamibi scanning in patients undergoing reoperation.\n [12] \n\nRegardless of the localization imaging technique used, the parathyroid surgeon should be skilled at reading, interpreting, and understanding these films.\n\nOutcomes\nThe reported outcomes from parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism are excellent, with success rates nearing 100%. Adil et al reported that 100% of patients who underwent MIP had hyper-functional parathyroid identified and excised, with appropriate reductions in intraoperative PTH levels.\n [2]  Beyer et al reported 100% rates of eucalcemia (cure) at 3 months following bilateral neck exploration and 99% rates of eucalcemia following MIP (due to 1 failure). Additionally, Adil et al found MIP was associated with lower costs, operating time, and length of stay in the hospital.\n [13]  A  review by Schneider et al found no difference in outcomes between minimally invasive and open approaches, with the exception of increased transient hypocalcemia in the open approach group (1.9% vs 0.1%).\n [14]  Leder et al reviewed the laryngeal physiology and acoustics of patients before and after MIP and found no differences amongst physiologic or voice acoustic measures.\n [15]  A meta-analysis by Ospina et al concluded that while both MIP and bilateral neck exploration are associated with high cure rates and low rates of complications, MIP displayed lower rates of hypocalcemia and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury compared to bilateral neck exploration.\n [16]  MIP also displayed shorter average operative times than bilateral neck exploration.\n [17] Overall, while cure rates for primary hyperparathyroidism following parathyroidectomy via bilateral neck exploration and MIP are excellent, MIP offers the potential added benefit of fewer complications, shorter operation time and hospital stay, and subsequent decreased health care cost.\n\nNeurocognitive benefits of parathyroidectomy\nAlthough some patients with primary hyperparathyroidism may be classified asymptomatic, if asked, many report chronic fatigue, malaise, memory impairment, depression, lack of focus, and poor sleep.\n [18]  The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism increases with age and is particularly high in postmenopausal women. Geriatric patients with age-related decline in cognitive function may be at particular risk for further losses in cognitive ability.\n [19]  Overall, it has been demonstrated that operative intervention can successfully correct these neurocognitive disturbances with studies indicating improvements in neurocognition and quality of life following parathyroidectomies.\n [20] Neurocognitive function and sleep have been shown to be restored to the level of the general population.\n [21]  Specifically, parathyroidectomy in geriatric patients has been shown to improve neurocognitive deficits significantly.\n [22]  These improvements have also been shown to occur extremely rapidly with improvements in memory, attention, anxiety, sleep, and other objective measurements seen as early as 1 week following surgery.\n [23]  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Modified Radical Neck Dissection": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe presence of cervical lymph node metastasis reduces survival of patients with squamous carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract by up to 50%. Since Crile's landmark publication in 1906, the radical neck dissection (RND) has remained the criterion standard for excision of cervical nodal metastases resulting from head and neck cancer.\n [1] Hayes Martin further popularized use of the RND in the 1950s.\n [2] The procedure uses, in Crile's words, \"a 'block dissection' of the regional lymphatic system . . . on exactly the same lines as the Halstead operation for cancer of the breast. Such a dissection is indicated whether the glands are or are not palpable.\" \nThe RND remained the mainstay of cervical lymphadenectomy procedures for the treatment of most patients with regionally metastatic head and neck cancer until the 1990s, when the head and neck community began to embrace less morbid approaches. This philosophical shift in the treatment paradigm occurred in the absence of substantive prospective investigational research evidence that demonstrated equivalent oncologic efficacy to the RND. Nonetheless, the life-altering morbidity associated with the RND became a driving force for change and critical re-evaluation of the rationale for the surgical management of head and neck cancer that was irreversible.\n\n\nIn 1952, Martin began to address the morbidity associated with the RND. Since then, the focus of criticism against the RND has addressed the related morbidity, causing other surgeons, including Jesse and Ballantyne, to search for cervical lymphadenectomy procedures that could provide oncologic cure with less morbidity.\n [3] This article reviews the rationale for and technique of the modified radical neck dissection (MRND) that developed from these efforts.\nAn image depicting a neck dissection incision can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncision typically performed for patients requiring bilateral neck dissections.

The Latin-derived term cervical means \"of the neck.\" The neck supports the weight of the head and is highly flexible, allowing the head to turn and flex in different directions. \n\nThe midline in front of the neck has a prominence of the thyroid cartilage termed the laryngeal prominence, or the so-called \"Adam's apple. Between the Adam’s apple and the chin, the hyoid bone can be felt; below the thyroid cartilage, a further ring that can be felt in the midline is the cricoid cartilage. Between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch, the trachea and isthmus of the thyroid gland can be felt. \n\nThe quadrangular area is on the side of the neck and is bounded superiorly by the lower border of the body of the mandible and the mastoid process, inferiorly by the clavicle, anteriorly by a midline in front of the neck, and posteriorly by the trapezius muscle. \n\nMuscles in the front of the neck are the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles and the anterior vertebral muscles.

        "Myringotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nMyringotomy is a surgical procedure of the eardrum or tympanic membrane. The procedure is performed by making a small incision with a myringotomy knife through the layers of tympanic membrane (see the image below). This surgical procedure permits direct access to the middle ear space and allows the release of middle-ear fluid, which is the end product of otitis media with effusion (OME), whether acute or chronic. OME is classified as serous, mucoid, or purulent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMyringotomy (radial incision). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nThe fluid is suctioned from the middle ear through the incision and, if indicated, sent for bacterial or viral cultures. Currently, bilateral myringotomy is often used in conjunction with placement of middle-ear ventilation tubes, which permits the incised drum to remain open and allows better drainage of middle-ear fluid.\n [1] This approach facilitates instillation of antibiotic otitic drops, and ultimately results in faster resolution of the OME.\n [2] \nOME may spontaneously occur as a result of inadequate ventilation of the middle-ear space related to poor eustachian tube function or a persistent inflammatory response to acute otitis media (AOM). Additional contributors to the development of OME include the immaturity both of the infant or young child’s immune system and of the anatomy of the eustachian tube.\n\n\n\n\nThe eustachian tube is the communication between the middle ear and the nasopharynx. Its function is to equalize pressure across the tympanic membrane. Contraction of the tensor veli palatini and the salpingopharyngeus outside of the tympanic cavity (middle ear) dilate and open the auditory tube.\n\n\n\n\nIn children, the eustachian tube is shorter, more horizontally oriented, and less functionally mature, and these differences can predispose children to OME. Inflammation of the mucosa of the eustachian tube orifice (from conditions such as upper respiratory infection [URI] or allergy) and improper functioning of the eustachian tube musculature lead to negative middle-ear pressure. Thus, when the eustachian tube opens, bacteria and viruses from the nasopharynx are drawn into the middle-ear space and generate an inflammatory response.\n\nOME has a strong correlation with URI. Children with craniofacial abnormalities that affect eustachian tube function (eg, Down syndrome and cleft palate) are at increased risk for otitis media. Immune deficiency should be suspected in children with OME that occurs in association with recurrent sinusitis, bronchitis, or gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities.\n\nOther predisposing conditions include allergy, adenoid hypertrophy, ciliary dysfunction, and gastroesophageal reflux. OME may be seen in patients with prolonged nasal intubation or nasogastric tubes.\n [2] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe tympanic membrane is an oval, thin, semi-transparent membrane that separates the external and middle ear (tympanic cavity). The tympanic membrane is divided into 2 parts: the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The manubrium of the malleus is firmly attached to the medial tympanic membrane; where the manubrium draws the tympanic membrane medially, a concavity is formed. The apex of this concavity is called the umbo. The area of the tympanic membrane superior to the umbo is termed the pars flaccida; the remainder of the tympanic membrane is the pars tensa (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTympanic membrane (TM): pars flaccida (superior to insertion manubrium) and pars tensa (remainder of TM). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe eustachian tube is the communication between the middle ear and the nasopharynx.

        "Nasal Endoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nNasal endoscopy involves evaluation of the nasal and sinus passages with direct vision using a magnified high-quality view. It is a commonly performed procedure in the otolaryngologist’s office and serves as an objective diagnostic tool in the evaluation of nasal mucosa, sinonasal anatomy, and nasal pathology. Nasal endoscopy may be accomplished with either a flexible fiberoptic endoscope or a rigid endoscope (see the images below). When performed by experienced practitioners, both flexible endoscopy and rigid endoscopy are usually well tolerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexible endoscope. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0 mm and 3.0 mm rigid nasal endoscopes. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fiberoptic telescope has the advantage of being flexible and generally smaller in diameter, which means that it is readily manipulated in multiple directions to permit visualization of tight areas. However, flexible endoscopy requires 2 hands for manipulation of the instrument and is thus a more difficult procedure. Traditionally, flexible endoscopy has provided inferior visualization, but this drawback has been overcome with the development of digital flexible endoscopes.\n\n\n\n\nThe rigid endoscope provides superior image clarity, facilitates culture and tissue sampling, controls epistaxis better, and affords the endoscopist the ability to perform surgery.\n [1, 2] Rigid endoscopes for the nose come in diameters of 2.7-4 mm and have tips of different angles (generally 0-70º), allowing the physician to visualize various sinuses and areas within the nasal cavity and sinuses.\n\nIn addition to affording superior visualization, nasal endoscopy provides improved illumination, greater magnification, and the ability to navigate directly to pathologic areas. As a result, examiners obtain a more accurate and thorough diagnostic evaluation. In one study, rigid nasal endoscopy identified nasal pathology in almost 40% of patients who had normal examinations on anterior rhinoscopy.\n [3] Endoscopy plays an important role in the preoperative, postoperative, and medical management of patients with sinonasal complaints.\n\nIndications\nNasal endoscopy has a clear role in the identification of sinonasal disease in patients presenting to the otolaryngologist's office. It should be viewed as an essential component of a complete examination of the nose and sinuses.\n\nIndications for nasal endoscopy include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial identification of disease in patients experiencing sinonasal symptoms (eg, mucopurulent drainage, facial pain or pressure, nasal obstruction or congestion, or decreased sense of smell)\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of patients' response to medical treatment (eg, resolution of polyps, purulent secretions, or mucosal edema and inflammation after treatment with topical nasal steroids, antibiotics, oral steroids, and antihistamines)\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of unilateral disease\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of patients with complications or impending complications of sinusitis\n\n\n\n\nObtaining a culture of purulent secretions\n\n\n\n\nDebridement and removal of crusting, mucus, and fibrin from obstructed nasal and sinus cavities after functional endoscopic sinus surgery\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation for recurrence of pathology after FESS to (this is particularly valuable in monitoring for recurrence of intranasal tumors)\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and biopsy of nasal masses or lesions\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the nasopharynx for lymphoid hyperplasia, eustachian tube problems, and nasal obstruction\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and treatment of epistaxis\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of hyposmia or anosmia\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and treatment of nasal foreign bodies\n\n\n\nContraindications\nNo absolute contraindications to nasal endoscopy exist; however, some patient populations are at increased risk for complications. In patients who have a history of a bleeding disorder or are receiving anticoagulants, nasal endoscopy should be performed carefully so as not to provoke bleeding. Additionally, in an anxious patient or a patient with cardiovascular disease, there is a risk of a vasovagal episode.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe septum is a midline bony and cartilaginous structure that divides the nose into 2 similar halves. Regarding the lateral nasal wall and paranasal sinuses, the superior, middle, and inferior concha form corresponding superior, middle, and inferior meatus on the lateral nasal wall. The superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid cells and the sphenoid sinus. The middle meatus provides drainage of anterior ethmoid and the maxillary and frontal sinuses. The inferior meatus provides drainage of the nasolacrimal duct.\n\nThe internal nasal valve involves the area bounded by upper lateral cartilage, septum, nasal floor, and anterior head of the inferior turbinate. This makes up the narrowest portion of the nasal airway in the leptorrhine nose.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nNasal endoscopy and imaging are the 2 most widely used objective measures in the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).\n [4] Endoscopy has multiple uses in the management of patients with sinonasal symptoms and plays an important role in both the preoperative and postoperative management of patients.\n\nThe Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scoring system quantifies the pathologic states of the nose and paranasal sinuses, focusing on the presence of polyps, discharge, edema, scarring, or adhesions and crusting.\n [5] Endoscopic staging is performed bilaterally and typically takes place during the initial evaluation, preoperatively, and postoperatively at regular intervals (intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months are recommended).\n\nLund-Kennedy scores range from 0 to 20. Polyps are graded as absent (0), present in the middle meatus (1), or present beyond the middle meatus (3). Discharge is graded as not present (0), thin (1), or thick and purulent (2). Edema, scarring, and crusting are each graded as absent (0), mild (1), or severe (2). Interrater agreement studies examining the reliability of the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scoring system demonstrate that in a high proportion of cases, 2 independent observers agree on the examination findings.\n [6] \n\nThe addition of nasal endoscopy to the care of patients with CRS has resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy.\n [4, 7] In combination with established symptom criteria, endoscopic findings improve the specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of assessment for CRS.\n [8] This development suggests that the use of diagnostic endoscopy may help decrease the need for computed tomography (CT) and reduce costs and radiation exposure.\n\nIn a triological society best-practice article discussing the role of nasal endoscopy in diagnosing CRS, the authors concluded that nasal endoscopy alone has low sensitivity but has consistently demonstrated high specificity in identifying CRS, making it a useful confirmatory test. Nasal endoscopy was also found to have high diagnostic accuracy in individuals with the combination of symptom criteria and positive endoscopic findings.\n [9] It is in these patients that a diagnosis of CRS may be made without additional imaging.\n\nAdditionally, Ferguson et al in their 2012 study found that the sensitivity of nasal endoscopy was 24% and the specificity was 100%, with the finding of mucopurulence only present in those patients with positive CRS on CT.\n [10] \n\nDiagnostic endoscopy has also proven to be an integral aspect of staging for allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS). Kupferberg-Kuhn created 4 stages of disease for AFS on the basis of findings from nasal endoscopy.\n [11] \n\nIn addition to providing an objective measure on examination, endoscopy is also considered the criterion standard for tissue sampling and culture collection when performed properly.\n [4] Traditionally, inferior meatal puncture was the diagnostic method used to identify pathogens in sinusitis; however, study results have documented a greater than 90% correlation between endoscopically obtained cultures and maxillary sinus aspirates, making endoscopically guided cultures the current criterion standard.\n [12, 13] \n\nIn a study that employed nasal endoscopy to obtain cultures for microbiologic diagnosis, 90% of the specimens collected by nasal endoscopy resulted in a culture with 2 or fewer bacterial isolates, and 55% of these contained a single isolate.\n [14] These results are superior to those obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab. Postoperatively, endoscopy plays an important role not only by monitoring for recurrence of pathology but also by allowing timely debridement in the immediate postoperative period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nasal Fracture Reduction": "\nOverview\n\n\nNasal bone fractures are among the most common facial bone fractures.\n [1] According to several retrospective studies, nasal bone fractures comprise up to 50% of all facial fractures. The prototypical patient is a male aged 15-30 years who was involved in a fight, motor vehicle accident, or fall.\n [2] \nPractitioners must understand the anatomy of the nasal bones before attempting any manipulation. The paired nasal bones project from the frontal processes of the maxilla, superiorly from the nasal process of the frontal bone, and join in the midline (see the image below). The quadrangular, or septal, cartilage supports the nasal bones from below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal bone anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nThe lateral nasal walls contain 3 pairs each of small, thin, shell-like bones: the superior, middle, and inferior conchae, which form the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to these curved structures lies the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy. \n\n\n\n\nApproximately 80% of nasal fractures occur between the thicker proximal and thinner distal segments of the nasal bones. Although frontal impact can cause fracture of the nasal bones, lateral impacts are more common. These lateral impact injuries typically cause a depression of one nasal bone and may result in a lateral displacement of the contralateral nasal bone.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nDiagnosis\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nMost nasal fractures are diagnosed by history and physical examination.\n\n\n\n\nHistory usually includes a preexisting trauma, which may be followed by epistaxis. Typically, the epistaxis has resolved by the time the patient presents for intervention.\n\n\n\n\nPatients usually present with swelling over the nasal bridge and a difference in the appearance or shape of the nose.\n\n\n\n\nPhysical examination findings include swelling over the nasal bridge, grossly apparent deviation of the nasal bones, and periorbital ecchymosis. \n\n\n\n\nPlain radiographs are not helpful in the diagnosis or management of nasal fractures in isolated nasal injury.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nNasal bone CT scan is helpful if the patient has associated facial fractures.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nBe sure to ask the patient how the external shape of the nose has changed since the fracture. This helps determine what corrective maneuvers should be taken to restore the patient’s appearance through reduction of the nasal fracture. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nasal Septal Button Placement": "\nOverview\n\n\nPerforations of the nasal septum (see images below) are often asymptomatic but can lead to a host of distressing symptoms. Large anterior lesions are more likely to disrupt nasal laminar air flow and be symptomatic.\n [1] Posterior perforations tend to be less troublesome as humidification of the nasal mucosa and turbinates is maintained. Crusting and epistaxis are the most frequently noted symptoms, but difficulty breathing, pain, rhinorrhea, and postnasal discharge are also common.\n [2, 3] Small anterior lesions may cause a whistling sound with inspiration.\n [4] Improvement in sleep apnea parameters, specifically supine Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and time spent in REM sleep have been reported to improve in patients with nasal septal perforations after placement of a septal button.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\nEndoscopic view of a septal perforation from the left nasal airway. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndoscopic view of a septal perforation from the right nasal airway. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nApproximately 40% of perforations in adults are iatrogenic. External and intranasal trauma, cocaine use, cautery, and chemical inhalants are less frequent etiologies. Infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), sarcoidosis, and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease should also be considered; rheumatological conditions can be identified with biopsy.\n [3] Perforations in children are rare and typically the result of trauma.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nEvidence suggests that systemic disease is more likely to result in a posterior perforation, whereas trauma, in particular nose-picking, is likely to result in an anterior perforation.\n [7] Rarely, septal perforation can be the initial presenting symptom of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, which stresses the need for biopsy of suspicious lesions or perforations. \n\n\n\n\nThe initial management of septal perforations is to correct the underlying causative process and encourage natural healing of the lesion. Conservative treatment consists of emollients, nasal irrigations, and humidification.\n [4] (See Septal Perforation - Medical Aspects.) For patients with persistent symptoms, surgical closure or placement of a septal prosthesis are available options (see image below).\n [8, 9] (See Septal Perforation - Surgical Aspects) The techniques and success rates of different closure techniques vary considerably in the literature.\n [8, 10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal septal perforation prosthesis. Courtesy of InHealth Technologies (https://www.inhealth.com/category_s/162.htm). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nSeptal buttons have been commonly used since the 1970s and may be placed in an office setting under local anesthesia or in the operation room. Buttons have been made from acrylic and plastic in the past but are now primarily made of soft silicone (Silastic; see image below).\n [11] Prefabricated buttons are typically 1-piece units with a flexible hub and pliable discs, which allows them to adapt to the curvatures and irregularities of the septum.\n [11] Two-piece units are increasingly available and tend to be easier to insert. Buttons may be placed as temporary or long-term treatment and do not preclude future surgical closure. Septal buttons are also an option for those in whom surgery may be contraindicated because of age, comorbidities, or underlying pathology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal septal button. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPrefabricated buttons are excellent options for many septal perforations. Most patients experience improvement or resolution of epistaxis, difficulty breathing, pain, and whistling after placement of nasal septal buttons.\n [12] However, less than half experience improvement in rhinorrhea and postnasal drainage,\n [3] while improvement in crusting is variable.\n [4, 3] Patient intolerance is usually due to local irritation, nasal obstruction, or accumulation of inspissated secretions. Patients who request removal usually do so within the first 6 months.\n [2] \n\nImprecise fit of a nasal septal button may result in increased crusting, obstruction, foreign body sensation, and button dislodgement. Custom-fit button prostheses may provide more comfortable and more reliable fit.\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined outcomes when using computed tomography (CT) to custom-fit septal buttons. These techniques are particularly useful for large (>3 cm) perforations in which adjacent soft tissue to secure the button in place is limited. A precise fit is necessary to avoid movement of the button, which can enlarge the perforation and allow the button to be dislodged.\n [3, 13] Button loss after 5 years is often due to button breakdown, but this exceeds the normal wearout period for Silastic.\n [3] Additionally, CT-fabricated buttons may improve symptoms to a greater degree than traditional obturators.\n [13] \n\nOther more recently described techniques for generating a custom-fit septal button prosthetics include a handled silicone septal button prosthesis fashioned using an alginate mould and plaster cast,\n [14] as well as a magnet-based 2-piece button prosthesis.\n [15] Advantages of these buttons include patient comfort and ease of insertion and removal, including the ability for the patient to be able to do so on their own.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe septum is a midline structure that divides the nose into 2 similar halves. The majority of the anterior septum is made up by the quadrangular cartilage. The posterior aspect of the septum is predominantly bony and includes the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone superiorly and the vomer inferiorly. The septum also receives bony contributions along its periphery from the maxillary, palatine, frontal, and nasal bones. Perforations, in particular those that are symptomatic, typically occur in the anterior half of the nose and correspond to the cartilaginous portion of the septum. The blood supply to the cartilage is dependent on flow from the nasal mucosa to the perichondrium, unlike bone, which has its own internal blood supply. This makes the anterior portion of the septum more susceptible to perforation secondary to mucosal insults than the posterior, bony portion. Mucosal injuries typically need to be opposing on both sides of a given segment of cartilage to fully degrade the blood supply and lead to necrosis and subsequent perforation.\n\nAlong the lateral nasal wall lie three finger-like projections referred to as the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates. The turbinates are instrumental in humidifying air during nasal breathing. They are important surgically both as landmarks and targets for reduction to improve nasal airflow and reduce congestion. They border the superior, middle, and inferior meatuses, respectively. The superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid cells and the sphenoid sinus. The middle meatus provides drainage of anterior ethmoid and the maxillary and frontal sinuses. The inferior meatus provides drainage of the nasolacrimal duct.\n\nThe internal nasal valve involves the area bounded by upper lateral cartilage, septum, nasal floor, and anterior head of the inferior turbinate. This makes up the narrowest portion of the nasal airway in the leptorrhine nose.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nasal Septal Hematoma Drainage": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe nose is the most frequently injured facial structure. In the setting of trauma to the anterior nasal septum, hematoma formation may occur.\n [1] Although septal hematomas are rare, early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent abscess formation, septal perforation, saddle-nose deformity, and potentially permanent complications.\n [2, 3] \nThe anterior portion of the nasal septum is composed of a thin cartilaginous plate with a closely adherent perichondrium and mucosa. Submucosal blood vessels are torn as buckling forces pull the perichondrium from the cartilage. Subsequently, blood may collect between the perichondrium and the septal cartilage. Bacterial proliferation and abscess formation may then result from the presence of stagnant blood. A hematoma may become infected within 3 days of the trauma. See images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal nasal septum. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal septal hematoma. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nasal septum derives its blood supply from the sphenopalatine and the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries with the added contribution of the superior labial artery (anteriorly) and the greater palatine artery (posteriorly). The Kiesselbach plexus, or the Little area, represents a region in the anteroinferior third of the nasal septum, where all 3 of the chief blood supplies to the internal nose converge. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\nThe nasal septum is normally 2-4 mm thick. If the cartilage is fractured, blood can dissect through the fracture line and form bilateral hematomas; therefore, both sides should be examined. According to a study by Canty et al, the most common symptoms noted in children were nasal obstruction (95%), pain (50%), rhinorrhea (25%), and fever (25%).\n [4] Symptoms usually appear within the first 24-72 hours.\n\nNasal septal hematoma in adults typically occurs with significant facial trauma and nasal fracture. However, in children, nasal septal hematoma may be found with minor nasal trauma such as simple falls, collisions with stationary objects, or minor altercations with siblings.\n [5, 6, 7] Additionally, the presence of nasal septal hematoma with or without concomitant injuries should raise suspicion for child abuse, especially in infants and toddlers.\n\nA careful examination is important for anyone who sustains nasal trauma. Signs of external trauma, such as nasal deformity, epistaxis, or significant pain, are associated with a septal hematoma. However, a septal hematoma may be present without any signs of external trauma.\n [1] \n\nA septal hematoma can usually be diagnosed by inspecting the septum with a nasal speculum or an otoscope. Asymmetry of the septum with a bluish or reddish fluctuance may suggest a hematoma. Direct palpation may also be necessary, as newly formed hematomas may not be ecchymotic. The best way to palpate is to insert a gloved small finger into the patient’s nose and palpate along the entire septum, feeling for swelling, fluctuance, or widening of the septum. Blood clots should be suctioned to allow better visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Home Sleep Monitoring": "\nOverview of Obstructive Sleep Apnea\n\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common, widely underdiagnosed condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Due to intermittent anatomical blockage of the upper airway, reduction or cessation of airflow occurs during sleep, resulting in recurrent oxygen desaturation and sympathetic neural activation, with resultant nighttime hypertension and cortical arousal. This cycle results in sleep fragmentation and limits the amount of time spent in deeper sleep stages. Common symptoms include snoring, restless sleep, daytime fatigue, and morning headaches.\nIf not treated, OSA is associated with an increased risk of cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic conditions, including hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, and sudden death.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] The estimated prevalence of OSA with associated daytime sleepiness is 4% in adult men and 2% in adult women.\n\n\nThe prevalence of OSA as defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 or higher is considerably higher and may include up to 24% of males and 9% of females.\n [14] The vast majority of these patients snore.

        "Oral Brush Biopsy With Computer-Assisted Analysis": "\nOverview\n\n\nWithin the specific context of 30,000 new cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer diagnosed each year in the United States and the associated 9000 deaths is the broader picture of individuals with potentially detectable precancerous lesions. Most cases include patients with asymptomatic oral and oropharyngeal mucosal alterations. The nature and behavior of these asymptomatic oral and oropharyngeal mucosal alterations may remain uncertain to the clinician. This has been emphasized to the public and to the professions in an effort to increase awareness of this disease, with the goal of early detection and thus improved end point results.\n [1] \nIdentification of each lesion in a safe and accurate fashion presumes that the person with the mucosal abnormality presents to a practitioner who possesses a level of understanding concerning mucosal abnormalities of the upper aerodigestive tract and/or oral cavity, that is to say, the oropharynx. This is emphasized within the context of Bouquot's study in 1986, which noted that as many as 10% of American adults have some form of oral abnormality.\n [2] The clinician wishing to investigate identified abnormalities may use a scalpel biopsy or a punch biopsy to obtain a representative tissue sample for pathologic analysis.\n\n\nThe most definitive, accurate, and reliable method for diagnosing oral mucosal abnormalities has been and remains the scalpel biopsy. However, when presented with the need to have an oral or oropharyngeal mucosal biopsy performed, the patient is often reluctant, and at times fearful, of such an invasive surgical procedure. The patient's reluctance may be compounded by the clinician's hesitation to perform a surgical procedure in an unfamiliar location or anatomical site. The clinician may be generally unfamiliar concerning the performance of any form of intraoral or upper aerodigestive tract biopsy.\nIn contrast to the sampling of cells of the uterine cervix, analysis of surface epithelial cells of the oral cavity and oropharynx by standard exfoliative cytology has proven to be unreliable in identifying as many as 31% of dysplastic lesions as demonstrated in one study.\n [3] Obtaining and sampling cells within the basal and parabasal region of the epithelium is central to the consistent and accurate diagnosis of early oral and oropharyngeal cancer or precancer. Although the standard scalpel biopsy accomplishes accurate identification of such changes, a less complex but consistent diagnostic approach with high levels of sensitivity and specificity would be welcomed within the practicing community.\n\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, the development of the brush biopsy (Oral CDx R) coupled with a computer-assisted method of analysis has brought accurate diagnosis, ease of performance, and patient acceptance into daily practice. The accuracy of this diagnostic modality has been noted beyond the initial studies, with positive predictive values of atypical and positive brush biopsy results being greater than 44%.\n [4] In contrast to traditional exfoliative cytology, the brush biopsy, using a specially designed circular bristled brush, is able to access and sample all epithelial layers, including the basal cell layer and the most superficial aspects of the lamina propria. Thus, the cellular material obtained is a true representation of all epithelial layers in a disaggregated form spread over the surface of an ordinary glass slide. In addition, this technique has been applied to other forms of analysis, including DNA image cytometry.\n [5, 6, 7, 8] \n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Mehrotra et al emphasized the value of the brush biopsy technique in evaluating oral lesions without the aid of computer-assisted technology, although they reported marginally lower sensitivity and specificity. The emphasis was to put this valuable approach into widespread use in communities where resources are limited but the need is high.\n [9] More recently, the efficacy of this technique has been reported with a positive predictive value of 84% and negative predictive value of 98% in cases that were deemed minimally suspicious.\n [10] In a study of 70 cases of clinically suspicious oral mucosal lesions without evidence of malignancy, the brush biopsy was noted to provide a sensitivity of 55% and corresponding specificity of 100%.\n [11] \n\nThis technique has been used in conjunction with toluidine blue staining, with affirmation of the high degree of sensitivity and sensitivity for malignant lesions.\n [12] Further studies using analytical tools, including mass spectrometry in conjunction with brush biopsy specimens in distinguishing healthy and malignant oral mucosal tissue and between cancer and other noncancerous lesions have shown overall accuracy of 96.5%.\n [13] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Oral Cancer Screening": "\nOverview\n\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, there were about 54,000 new cases of and about 11,230 deaths from oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer in 2022. These cancers are more than twice as common in men as in women. They are about equally common in blacks and in whites. The overall rate of new cases of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers has risen only slightly over the past 20 years. But during this same time, there has been an increase specifically in oropharyngeal cancers associated with an human papillomavirus (HPV) infection2 in both men and women. The overall death rate for these cancers has been decreasing over the last 30 years.\n [1] \nThese statistics suggest that oral cancer death rates are higher than those from Hodgkin lymphoma, laryngeal cancer, cancer of the testes, and endocrine system cancers such as thyroid and skin cancer (eg, malignant melanoma). The incidence or oral cancer also appears to be significantly different based on race and other confounders such as smoking, and alcohol consumption.\n\n\nGiven the prevalence of these behaviors in the World, the WHO and the 58th World Health Assembly Resolution on Cancer Prevention and Control has urged Member States to develop and reinforce cancer control programs to prioritize tumors and risk factors. Age is another confounder of oral cancer risk.\nThe most common oral cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (see image below). Other less common cancers occurring intraorally include adenocarcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image depicts reddening of the soft palate, perhaps with scattered areas of white and velvet red patches; tobacco-induced squamous cell carcinoma involving the tongue base and/or supraglottis; and a firm, mobile mass that is palpable at the left carotid bifurcation. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne explanation for the high death rate is that oral cancer may not be readily identified until it has metastasized because of its location. This may, in part, be because oral cancer is often painless initially (until it invades the deeper tissues) and thus goes unnoticed by the patient.\n [2] Of course, prognosis is much worse when undetected disease has spread to the neck lymph nodes. Not only is the primary tumor detection an issue, but in the patient with primary oral cancer, a higher risk exists for the development of undetected secondary lesions.\n\nThus, early detection of oral cancer is extremely important in terms of morbidity and mortality. Note that the 5-year survival rate for oral cancer depends not only on the site of the malignancy but also the length of time that the lesion has been present, particularly since chronic lesions are more likely to be associated with metastasis and lymph node involvement.\n [3] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe oral cavity (see image below) is oval shaped and is separated into the oral vestibule and the oral cavity proper. It is bound by the lips anteriorly, the cheeks laterally, the floor of the mouth inferiorly, the oropharynx posteriorly, and the palate superiorly. The oropharynx begins superiorly at the junction between the hard palate and the soft palate, and inferiorly behind the circumvallate papillae of the tongue.

        "Oral Tissue Biopsy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nOral tissue biopsy may be necessary for lesions that cannot be diagnosed on the basis of the history and clinical findings alone. A thorough inspection of the oral cavity should be a part of any complete head and neck examination. Approximately 10% of patients who are examined will have some abnormality of the oral mucosa. Biopsy is often the definitive procedure that provides tissue for microscopic analysis when additional information is required to guide any indicated therapy.\n [1, 2] \n\n\nThe development of a reasonable differential diagnosis is of prime importance in determining if biopsy is indicated. Furthermore, the differential diagnosis aids the clinician in selecting the appropriate technique if biopsy is necessary.\nA waiting period of 2 weeks often helps in forming the differential diagnosis; lesions that are related to infection, inflammation, or local trauma may resolve during this time. Biopsy is strongly recommended for the evaluation of most lesions that persist for 2 weeks or longer after the potential irritants are removed.\n\n\n\n\nConventional cytologic examination of the oral cavity is associated with an unacceptably high false-negative rate. However, for clinicians who are uncomfortable with intraoral surgery, brush biopsy with sampling of the full thickness of the mucosa may provide reliable information regarding the presence of cellular atypia. A positive result requires referral for scalpel biopsy.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nBiopsy is indicated for the assessment of any unexplained oral mucosal abnormality that persists despite treatment or the removal of local irritants. Malignancy is suspected when persistent oral mucosal lesions are red or red and white or when they are ulcerated, indurated, or fixed to deeper tissues. Persistent lesions that bleed easily or grow rapidly should also alert the clinician to the possibility of malignancy. Unexplained pigmented oral lesions are of concern if they are new or changed. Biopsy is recommended unless the pigmented area has been present and unchanged for 5 years or longer.\n\nScalpel biopsy may be warranted even when the differential diagnosis includes only benign entities. Lesions that interfere with function and those that have an undesirable effect on esthetics should be excised.\n\nEven experienced clinicians have difficulty in distinguishing between truly innocuous oral mucosal changes and those that represent dysplasia or early invasive cancer. Therefore, the decision to forego biopsy in an apparently benign lesion should be made with great care and only when the patient understands the need for close follow-up and agrees to comply.\n\nContraindications\nOral mucosal biopsy has few contraindications. The standard biopsy techniques may require modification in some patients, including those with conditions that preclude the safe use of local anesthetic and those with severe bleeding diatheses or coagulopathies. Invasive procedures that may stimulate bone should be avoided when possible, or conducted with great caution in patients who have used or are currently using injectable bisphosphonates. Mucosal lesions in these individuals may be reflective of underlying medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ), a condition that may be exacerbated by any manipulation. Caution should also be taken with lesions that appear vascular, especially when there is a palpable pulsation or bruit.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe oral cavity (see the image below) is oval shaped and is separated into the oral vestibule and the oral cavity proper. It is bound by the lips anteriorly, the cheeks laterally, the floor of the mouth inferiorly, the oropharynx posteriorly, and the palate superiorly. The oropharynx begins superiorly at the junction between the hard palate and the soft palate, and inferiorly behind the circumvallate papillae of the tongue. The bony base of the oral cavity is represented by the maxillary and mandibular bones. The oral cavity includes the lips, gingivae, retromolar trigone, teeth, hard palate, cheek mucosa, mobile tongue, and floor of the mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of oral cavity and floor of mouth.

Teeth are numbered according to international classification. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe tongue is basically a mass of muscle that is almost completely covered by a mucous membrane. From anterior to posterior, the tongue has 3 surfaces: tip, body, and base. The tip is the highly mobile, pointed anterior portion of the tongue. Posterior to the tip lies the body of the tongue, which has dorsal (superior) and ventral (inferior) surfaces.\n\nThe lips surround the entrance to the oral cavity. The upper lip extends from the base of the nose superiorly to the nasolabial folds laterally and to the free edge of the vermilion border inferiorly. The lower lip extends from the superior free vermilion edge superiorly, to the commissures laterally, and to the mandible inferiorly. Around the circumferential vermilion-skin border, a fine line of pale skin accentuates the color difference between the vermilion and normal skin.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Mouth Anatomy, Tongue Anatomy, and Lips and Perioral Region Anatomy.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nThe excision of lip lesions requires planning and tissue stabilization. In general, excision lines should be parallel to the nerves and vessels; however, a substantial excision from the lip parallel to its long axis may result in a decrease of visible vermilion after healing. The white roll of the lip may be pulled in because of the loss of tissue and contracture during healing. Although this excision is unlikely to produce a major deformity, the aesthetics may be compromised.\n\nExcisions made perpendicular to the long axis of the lip are far less likely to produce this type of distortion; however, with the 3:1 rule (ie, the specimen should be 3 times longer that it is wide), the excision of a lesion near the vermilion border requires the clinician to cross onto the skin to produce a wound that can be closed properly. This incision may result in a scar that is more visible and more troublesome to the patient than one confined to only the labial mucosa. To ensure correct approximation of the vermilion border, it should be marked prior to excision.\n\nExcisional biopsy of the lip may be difficult to perform without assistance. Bleeding can obscure the field, and the mobility of the labial tissues further complicates what should be a simple procedure. Local hemostasis and tissue stabilization are managed better if the clinician and an assistant each firmly grip the lip by placing their thumb and index finger on either side of the lesion, as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lip is being held by a clinician and an assistant. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThis clamping occludes the labial artery and its local branches while immobilizing and tensing the tissue. Another approach is to use a chalazion clamp, which reduces bleeding, tenses and stabilizes the tissue, and provides the operator with a convenient handle so that control can be maintained throughout the procedure. After the specimen is removed from the field, the chalazion clamp (shown below) is loosened slowly and carefully, and any bleeding sites are addressed before the wound is closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChalazion clamp. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nTongue lesions present similar difficulties. An assistant can stabilize the tongue by wrapping the tip in a gauze sponge and grasping it firmly. Alternatively, heavy sutures or towel clamps can be used to control the tongue after appropriate local anesthesia is achieved (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tongue is being stabilized for biopsy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nWhen tongue wounds are closed, deep sutures should be placed when indicated, and mucosal sutures should be placed fairly close to each other. Inadequately closed wounds on this movable and highly vascularized organ tend to re-open, with resultant oozing and/or delayed healing.\n\nA different set of issues arises when excision is planned for a lesion that appears to emanate from the keratinized attached gingiva. A periodontist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon should evaluate and manage these lesions. A number of pathologic entities that appear to arise from the gingiva are actually derived from the periodontal ligament. Recurrence is more likely in these lesions if their true origin is not addressed. In addition, even the appropriate excisions of small amounts of attached gingiva may result in significant periodontal defects.\n\nLesions on the hard palate that are remote from teeth may be safely excised as long as attention is paid to the underlying vascular anatomy. Since keratinized oral tissues are tightly bound to the skeleton, denuded bone may remain after this type of excisional biopsy is performed. Inform the patient that denuded bone in the oral cavity can cause discomfort for several weeks. Even if bone is not exposed, resultant wounds that involve the attached gingiva and palate are generally not closed primarily. Some clinicians use dressings, packings, or even surgical stents to assist in managing palatal wounds such as those created by biopsy.\n\nProcedure Planning\n\nMost biopsies in the oral cavity are performed for the evaluation of mucosal changes. When pathologic entities arise from deeper tissues, techniques must be adapted and appropriate instrumentation selected. Such situations may include soft tissue masses deep to the surface with normal-appearing overlying mucosa, lesions within the jaws, and tumors of salivary gland origin.\n\nIntraosseus lesions generally require biopsy to establish a tissue diagnosis. Most of these lesions are cysts and benign tumors; however, primary malignancies, metastatic disease, and jaw lesions associated with systemic disease should be considered. Due to behavioral differences and therefore varying treatment recommendations among jaw cysts and tumors, a tissue diagnosis is recommended to provide direction.\n\nThe standard approach to intrabony lesions of the jaws involves reflection of a mucoperiosteal flap using a crestal incision and releasing incisions as needed. These should be placed far enough from the planned entry into bone to provide good access and to ensure that incision lines lie over sound bone. Aspiration with an 18-gauge needle is recommended prior to flap reflection and entry into bone as some of these lesions may be vascular. If the lesion has not eroded and perforated bone, a window is made with a rotary instrument. The opening must be large enough to permit the sampling of an adequate amount of pathologic tissue so that a histopathologic diagnosis can be made.\n\nPatients with deeper soft tissue masses might benefit from fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) to check for the presence of cells that suggest malignancy. FNAB is rarely used in the oral cavity; however, some authors do describe using FNAB in the diagnosis of oral cavity and oropharyngeal lesions. FNAB is further described in Technique.\n\nAdditional techniques have been published, including an approach described for lesions of the tongue that may be difficult to access. One such report describes a translingual biopsy involving the blind passage of an instrument through the tongue to a lesion that is not amenable to traditional instrumentation because of its location. Further research into the success and safety of this technique is necessary before it gains acceptance.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Orbital Decompression for Graves Disease": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nGraves disease, originally called Graves-Basedow disease, was first described as the triad of hyperthyroidism, goiter, and exophthalmos in 1835. It is relatively common; it may occur in people of any age but is most common during the third to fifth decades of life. The female-to-male ratio varies from 4:1\n [1] to 2.5–6:1\n [2] to 8:1. The distribution is bimodal, with the peak incidence in the fifth and seventh decades of life.\n [3] Men tend to develop more severe orbitopathy.\n [4, 5] \n\n\nSevere ophthalmopathy is an uncommon but problematic manifestation of Graves disease. Only 5–6% of patients with Graves disease develop problems severe enough to warrant surgical decompression on a functional basis. This does not include patients who seek cosmetic decompression.\nApproximately half of all patients with Graves hyperthyroidism develop ophthalmopathy. In its most involved forms, the ophthalmopathy can result in severe corneal problems that necessitate decompression. Optic neuropathy due to compression of the optic nerve is another indication for decompression.\n\n\n\n\nOrbitopathy associated with Graves disease may severely compromise a patient’s vision. The condition may cause diplopia, decreased ocular motility, exposure keratitis, optic neuropathy, and poor cosmesis. Surgical management is both an alternative and adjunctive treatment to medical therapy, which most often involves corticosteroids, external beam radiotherapy, or both.\n\n\n\n\nVarious approaches have been described since surgical decompression of the orbit for thyroid ophthalmopathy was initially advocated in 1911.\n [6, 7, 8, 9] Orbital decompression most often involves the removal of the bones that comprise the orbit. Decompression of a lesser nature can be accomplished with the removal of extraconal and intraconal fat. This fat decompression can be combined with bone removal for more extensive decompression.\n\nThe advent of advanced endoscopic techniques has enabled surgeons to decompress the orbit endoscopically, allowing effective decompression with less morbidity. This is primarily a result of circumventing a gingival incision and a low incidence of cranial nerve V2 hypesthesia. Although an endoscopic approach to the medial and inferior walls can be performed in isolation, a balanced approach, incorporating a lateral decompression with repositioning of the lower lid, can be required.\n [10, 11] \n\nSee also the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nGraves Disease\n\n\n\n\nHyperthyroidism\n\n\n\n\nThyroid-Associated Orbitopathy\n\n\n\n\nPediatric Graves Disease\n\n\n\n\nPediatric Hyperthyroidism\n\n\n\nPathophysiology and etiology of Graves ophthalmopathy\nOrbital findings result from an increase in the volume of orbital tissues secondary to inflammation, edema, and congestion. Most notable is the enlargement of the extraocular muscles secondary to infiltration with inflammatory cells, deposition of immune complexes, and an increase in glycosaminoglycans, particularly hyaluronic acid, which is hydrophilic. In some cases, this is ultimately followed by fibrosis. These alterations are modulated by circulating antibodies. Smoking has been shown to increase venous congestion in the orbit via reduction of flow in the superior ophthalmic vein separate from extraocular muscle involvment, which were comparable between smokers and non smokers.\n [5] \n\nThese autoimmune dysfunctions are considered to be mediated by both humoral and cellular dysfunctions; however, this is debated. Regardless, the processes show a predilection for the orbital tissues, the extraocular muscles, and periorbital structures. Both orbitopathy and thyroid dysfunction are more common in family members of patients who have thyroid-related orbitopathy.\n\nSevere cases of ophthalmopathy may be associated with lid edema, chemosis (edema of the conjunctiva), and diminished ocular motility. Eventual sequelae may include corneal exposure with subsequent ulceration, diplopia due to extraocular muscle restriction, or fibrosis and optic nerve compression with resulting visual field deficits, including blindness.\n\nPatients with Graves orbitopathy usually have hyperthyroidism but can have euthyroidism or hypothyroidism. A patient may present with signs of orbitopathy before being diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. At some point, 90% of patients with orbitopathy have hyperthyroidism. More than 50% of patients develop orbitopathy after they have had hyperthyroidism. The degree of control of the thyroid disorder does not exactly correlate with the extent of the orbitopathy.\n\nThe orbit’s inflammatory response to the thyroid dysfunction consists of an increase in both B and T lymphocytes, accompanied by edema. These processes can cause scarring. In addition, fibroblastic activity with the resultant production of collagen and glycosaminoglycans also increases. Increased edema and increases in the thickness of the extraocular muscles and fat cells are also found. Some early fibroblasts convert into fat cells.\n\nIf a patient has hyperthyroidism, cigarette smoking increases the incidence and severity of thyroid-related orbitopathy. The antigens that specifically cause this are unclear.\n\nClinical presentation of Graves ophthalmopathy\nGraves-related exophthalmos usually occurs in adult life. The condition most commonly affects middle-aged women. It is more severe in older men, usually with greater exophthalmos. Graves orbitopathy is the most common cause of unilateral and bilateral proptosis. Most commonly it occurs in patients who are hyperthyroid, but also occurs in patients with hypothyroidism, euthyroidism, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n [12] \n\nEthnic variations in the anatomy of the orbits can be found; therefore, the degree of proptosis with its concomitant problems can vary greatly, regardless of race or gender. A person with a tighter orbit is more at risk for compressive optic neuropathy from the disease process and may not show as much proptosis as a person with a much less tight orbit who is more proptotic but does not as readily experience compressive optic neuropathy.\n\nRetraction of the upper or lower lid (Dalrymple sign) may develop. This is due to hyperstimulation of the sympathetically innervated Mueller muscle in the upper lid and its analog, the inferior tarsal muscle, in the lower lid. When the patient tries to look downward, the upper lid can hold back and lag behind the movement of the globe (von Graefe sign; also termed lid lag).\n\nUnilateral or bilateral proptosis (34–93% of patients), tearing (epiphora), chemosis (edema of the conjunctiva), and hyperemia or injection of the conjunctiva (an increase in the size of the blood vessels) may develop.\n\nA prominence of the blood vessels that overlie the insertion of the rectus muscles may develop. Edema of the lids and of the malar pad areas may develop. Corneal problems may vary from dryness to perforation when a full-thickness opening in the cornea is present.\n\nPatients can present in various stages. Patients with very mild cases may have low-grade orbital inflammation with some orbital discomfort, tearing, and chemosis. Other patients may have mild proptosis with or without lid retraction. Still other patients present with marked inflammation, tremendous discomfort, corneal problems, or optic nerve compression. Patients may have diplopia.\n\nIn burnt-out Graves orbitopathy, many of the same signs persist, except that the inflammation is gone and the eyes and orbits appear quiet. However, the proptosis, lid retraction, and diplopia still remain.\n\nPatients with hyperthyroidism can present with symptoms and signs of hyperstimulation of their sympathetic nervous system. These symptoms and signs include the following: weight loss, sweating, tremulousness, edginess, heart palpitations, an increase in appetite, feeling warm, and feeling \"revved up.\"\n\nNonsurgical treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy\nSevere orbital manifestations of Graves disease early in the disease course often respond to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. If this is unsuccessful, external beam radiation therapy at a dose of 20 Gy may be considered.\n [13] When orbital findings have been present for a long time, they are less likely to respond to medical management because of fibrosis of the involved tissues.\n\nSteroid treatment combined with radiation treatment has also proven effective.\n [14] \n\nIn patients for whom nonsurgical modalities are unsuccessful or those who are not considered candidates, surgical decompression may be considered. Medical treatment can also be used in conjunction with surgical decompression.\n\nNewer treatment modalities include the use of biologics. In one trial, rituximab showed benefits compared to steroids, and in another trial, it showed no benefit against placebo.\n [15, 16, 6, 17] One trial reported increased adverse events with the use of rituximab compared to saline.\n [18]  Compared to adalimumab, tocilizumab, and etanercept, rituximab reduced B cells that are CD20 positive.\n [19]  However, rituximab may have a role in steroid-resistant cases.\n [20] Teprotumumab, a monoclonal antibody that is an IGF-1 inhibitor, is showing promise in offsetting inflammation in Graves orbitopathy and decreasing proptosis.\n [21, 22] \n\nSurgical options\nVarious surgical approaches can be used for decompression. Otolaryngologists commonly perform decompression via a transantral approach to the medial and inferior orbital walls. An endoscopic approach to the medial and inferior walls is currently used. Oculoplastic specialists often use a transcutaneous or transconjunctival lower-lid approach. Often, the lower lid must be separated from its periosteal attachment and subsequently repaired. Transcaruncular approaches can also be used to access the medial orbital wall.\n\nThe lateral wall can be surgically approached in different ways. A team approach that involves the services of an otolaryngologist and an oculoplastic specialist is common. If the decompression requires the removal of the frontal bone, the services of a neurosurgeon may be required.\n\nUltimately, the approach or approaches used are tailored to the severity of the problem and therefore the degree of decompression desired and the anatomy of the patient. These decisions can be influenced by the cosmesis achieved, especially in patients who are undergoing decompressions to improve their appearance. A balanced approach in which the inferior wall and medial wall decompression are combined with lateral decompression may be used.\n\nMedial wall decompression with preservation of the medial strut between the ethmoid cavity and the inferior wall, balanced with lateral wall decompression and with or without inferior wall decompression, may provide effective reduction of exophthalmos without a high risk for new-onset postoperative diplopia, especially in patients who are having surgery for cosmetic indications.\n\nIn the authors’ view, this combined approach to surgery for patients with Graves ophthalmopathy, incorporating both an otolaryngologist with endoscopic experience and an oculoplastic surgeon, provides for ideal surgical management.\n\nAnatomic Considerations\nThe orbit, which protects, supports, and maximizes the function of the eye, is shaped like a quadrilateral pyramid, with its base in plane with the orbital rim. Seven bones conjoin to form the orbital structure, as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image of the right orbit shows the 7 bones that contribute to its structure. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe orbital process of the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid form the orbital roof. The orbital plate of the maxilla joins the orbital plate of the zygoma and the orbital plate of the palatine bones to form the floor. Medially, the orbital wall consists of the frontal process of the maxilla, the lacrimal bone, the sphenoid, and the thin lamina papyracea of the ethmoid. The lateral wall is formed by the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid and the zygoma.\n\nFor the transcutaneous or transconjunctival lower-lid approach, the inferior oblique muscle must be avoided. In fact, with either approach, during a bony decompression, the orbital space is not entered until the bone has been removed. Opening the periorbita earlier can allow the fat to prolapse, interfering with the dissection. The infraorbital nerve is to be avoided during any dissection to avoid postoperative paresthesia.\n\nMedially, the dissection and bone removal is accomplished but stays below the ethmoidal arteries to avoid compromising the anterior or posterior ethmoidal arteries (and thereby causing hemorrhages) and to avoid disrupting the cribriform plate.\n\nPosteromedially, care must be exercised when the sphenoid sinus is entered. If the carotid artery is violated, the result can be catastrophic.\n\nAdditionally, in more posterior dissections, damaging or resecting the optic nerve must be avoided during the dissection.\n\nThe relevant anatomy for endoscopic orbital decompression is similar to that for endoscopic ethmoidectomy and maxillary antrostomy. Specifically, the middle turbinate insertion at the skull base represents the medial limit of dissection, the fovea ethmoidalis is the superior limit, and the lamina papyracea is the lateral limit. The lamina extends from the nasolacrimal system anteriorly to the annulus of Zinn posteriorly. Cranial nerve V2 runs in the maxillary roof and can be dehiscent. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Orbit Anatomy.\n\nIn all cases, the globe must not be unduly pressed on. The amount and duration of pressure must be monitored to prevent inadvertently compression of the ophthalmic artery.\n\nIndications\nHistorically, the indications for surgical decompression of the orbit have included exophthalmos accompanied by corneal exposure and disfigurement and increased orbital pressure produced by swelling of extraocular muscles, which can lead to compressive optic neuropathy and visual loss. Recent advances in the techniques for orbital decompression have decreased the morbidity of the procedure, and a need for cosmetic decompressions is also an indication.\n\nEmergency decompression can be warranted in the most severe cases of compression and visual loss. However, this situation is usually concomitantly treated with immunosuppressive agents, most commonly systemic steroids. Radiation therapy can be used in the acute setting in addition to immunosuppressives; it may also be used for patients who are not surgical candidates.\n\nContraindications\nPatients who are unable to undergo a surgical procedure or who are unwilling to accept the potential complications of surgery are not candidates for orbital decompression. Other relative contraindications include a history of chronic sinusitis, immunocompromise, bleeding disorders, and atretic sinuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The anterior border is defined as the glossopalatal arch (also known as the anterior tonsillar pillar); the superior border is the plane of the soft palate; and the inferior border is the plane of the epiglottic tip. Major structures within the oropharynx include the tonsillar (faucial) arches, tonsils, vallecula, base of the tongue, soft palate, uvula, and posterior and lateral pharyngeal wall (within the confines of the axial planes outlined above).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the pharynx. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nThe muscles that form the posterior wall of the oropharynx are the overlapping superior and middle pharyngeal constrictors and their overlying mucous membrane.

For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Throat Anatomy.\nOropharyngeal biopsy may take several forms, all sharing the purpose of identifying the histopathology of lesions. Biopsies may be performed in the setting of an outpatient office, or may require formal operative settings with general anesthesia. The setting of the biopsy is determined by patient factors (eg, age, gag reflex), the extent of the biopsy (eg, small mucosal sample vs tonsillectomy), and accessibility of the lesion’s location (eg, base of the tongue, vallecula).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Parathyroidectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nSuccessful parathyroidectomy requires an understanding of both the anatomy and the embryology of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands arise from the dorsal endoderm of the third and fourth branchial pouches. The vast majority of patients have a total of 4 parathyroid glands: 2 superior and 2 inferior.\n\n\nThe inferior parathyroid glands, which arise from the third branchial pouch, initially migrate with the thymus until they separate to take their final position, usually at the level of the inferior pole of each thyroid lobe. The superior parathyroid glands (see the image below) arise from the fourth branchial pouch, follow the migration of the ultimobranchial bodies, and usually take their final position along the posterior part of the middle third of each thyroid lobe.\n [1] The superior parathyroid glands show less anatomic variation than the inferior thyroid glands do.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal-appearing right superior parathyroid gland seen on unrelated thyroid surgery. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parathyroid glands have a distinct, encapsulated, smooth surface that differs from the thyroid gland, which is has a more lobular surface, and lymph nodes, which are more pitted in appearance. The color of the parathyroid glands is typically light brown to tan, which relates to their fat content, vascularity, and percentage of oxyphil cells within the glands. The yellow color may be confused with surrounding fat. A distinct hilar vessel is also present that can be seen if the surrounding fat does not obscure the glands' hila.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Parathyroid Gland Anatomy.\n\nMost parathyroidectomies are performed for primary hyperparathyroidism. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroid adenoma (see the image below), which accounts for 75–90% of cases. Most parathyroid adenomas are not genetic but sporadic, and they involve all parathyroid glands equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParathyroid adenoma (7 g) removed from posterior mediastinum via cervical approach. Preoperative sestamibi scan was incorrectly read and showed inferior parathyroid adenoma; however, lesion was found to be superior parathyroid adenoma, located in ectopic location in posterior mediastinum. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nBetween 5% and 25% of cases of primary parathyroid hyperplasia involve multi-gland disease. Historically, it was felt that this included dobule parathyroid adenomas and 4-gland hyperplasia. While most authors believe that double parathyroid adenomas do occur, it is unclear how prevalent they are. When individual patients with double adenomas are followed over a long period, some experience recurrence of hyperparathyroidism and are ultimately diagnosed with 4-gland hyperplasia. This is further complicated by the fact that 4-gland hyperplasia can be asymmetric with some glands being very large and other glands appearring closer to normal in size, shape, and appearance. In 2012, Norman et al. published on more than 15,000 parathyroid cases. In the cohort of 3000 patients that had bilateral operations, aproximately 75% had one gland removed, 17% had two glands removed, 5% had three glands removed, and about 3% had three and a half glands removed.\n [2]  Parathyroid cancer is rare and accounts for fewer than 1% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe parathyroid glands are involved in calcium homeostasis. They release parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to low serum concentrations of ionized calcium, and the release of the hormone is inhibited by an increase in serum ionized calcium. PTH causes the kidneys to increase the tubular resorption of calcium and decrease the resorption of phosphorus.\n [3] PTH also acts on bone and the intestine to increase serum calcium levels.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the PTH level is inappropriately elevated in relation to the serum calcium level. In normal circumstances, a negative feedback loop exists in which the PTH level drops in response to an elevated serum calcium level. This does not occur in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n [4] \n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the PTH is elevated as the result of another cause. Vitamin D deficiency and renal failure are the 2 most common causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when glands affected by secondary hyperparathyroidism become autonomous and are no longer controlled by the normal feedback mechanisms. An example would be a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism from chronic renal failure who undergoes a renal transplant that corrects the renal failure but who continues to have inappropriate release of PTH.\n\nIndications\nHistorically, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism presented with symptoms related to the effects of PTH on the bone and kidneys. However, with the advent of routine blood screening tests, most patients today are asymptomatic or with minimal and often nonspecific symptoms at presentation. Currently, only 10–20% have renal stones, and very few have osteitis fibrosis.\n [5] \n\nAlthough patients may be referred with nothing more than elevated calcium and PTH levels, further questioning often reveals that they have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pains and aches, depression, constipation and abdominal discomfort, and decreased memory. These patients may be more accurately described as minimally symptomatic, rather than asymptomatic. Many of them will derive symptomatic benefit from parathyroid surgery, though such benefit cannot be guaranteed in advance.\n\nThe diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism requires, minimally, an increased serum total calcium level with an increased intact PTH level—or, at least, an inappropriately high normal PTH level. Serum calcium levels can fluctuate somewhat over time, but patients with primary hyperparathyroidism should have a documented increase in serum total or ionized calcium sometime during the course of the condition.  \n\nPatients with an elevated intact PTH level and a calcium concentration in the normal range often have secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can result from insufficient calcium or vitamin D intake, decreased intestinal calcium absorption, vitamin D malabsorption, or renal hypercalciuria.\n\nDepending on the cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism, surgery may or may not be an appropriate treatment option;\n [6] therefore, it is important to distinguish primary from secondary hyperparathyroidism before deciding on surgery for presumed primary hyperparathyroid disease.\n\nFor this reason, vitamin D levels should be checked preoperatively to rule out vitamin D deficiency, which can be a cause of elevated PTH. Sometimes patients may present with a high PTH, low vitamin D, and a calcium within the high normal range. Often in this case, once the low vitamin D is corrected the patient will develop an elevated calcium, and if the PTH remains elevated, now fit the classic presentation for primary hyperparathyroidism.\n [7]  A 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine test should also be administered to rule out familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH).\n\nTo further complicate matters, a new clinical entity called normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism has been introduced. Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism is when the calcium is normal and the PTH is persistently elevated and secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism, such as chronic kidney diease, vitamin D insufficiency, malabsorbtion syndromes, and side effects from medications such as lithium and thiazides have been excluded.\n [8, 9, 10] Some of these patients may also benefit from surgery. \n\nAs a result of the large number of patients being diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism on the basis of laboratory testing, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus panel has come up with the guidelines for recommending surgery in asymptomatic patients.\n [11, 12, 13] The guidelines were first introduced in 1990 and then amended in 2002 and again in 2008.\n [14, 15] \n\n\n\n\n\nBlood calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal\n\n\n\n\nBone density by DXA < -2.5 at any site (lumbar spine, hip, or forearm)\n\n\n\n\nHistory of kidney stones or evidence of kidney stones or calcifications in the kidney by imaging (e.g., X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan). Evidence for stone risk by 24-hour urine with excessive calcium and other stone risk factors.\n\n\n\n\nA fracture resulting from relatively little force, such as a fall from a standing or sitting position (a fragility fracture)\n\n\n\n\nAge < 50 years\n\n\n\nAlthough not included in the criteria, there is some conflicting evidence to suggest that primary hyperparathyroidism contributes to cardiovascular disease.\n [16, 17, 18] Some authors believe that the cardiovascular risks, as well as other nonspecific symptoms, can improve in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who do not meet the above cirteria.\n [17, 14]  It must be kept in mind that these guidelines are for asymptomatic patients. They do not apply, for example, to patients with a history of painful kidney stones for whom surgery is automatically indicated. The decision whether to provide surgical therapy for asymptomatic patients and those with minimal symptoms can be complicated. Often, the patient’s wishes, the surgeon’s experience, and the results of localization studies exert a substantial influence on this decision.\n\nContraindications\nParathyroid surgery is contraindicated in patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). Patients who have this disorder can present with elevated calcium and PTH levels, mimicking the serum biochemical characteristics of primary hyperparathyroidism. However, FHH is not treated surgically.\n\nIn patients with FHH, 24-hour urine calcium excretion is lower than expected in comparison with the serum calcium level. The ratio of 24-hour urinary calcium to creatinine clearance is usually lower than 0.01 in these patients, whereas it is typically higher than 0.01 in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\n [19, 20] In addition, FHH patients typically have normal or mildly elevated PTH levels. Calcium excretion over 24 hours is less than 100 mg in 75% of FHH patients but usually more than 200 mg in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\n [21] \n\nThiazide diuretics and lithium excess can cause elevated PTH and serum calcium levels, mimicking primary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, it is important to consider these medications when taking a history and to carry out further investigation if necessary before proceeding with surgery.\n\nAs localization studies become more frequent, patients may be directly referred for surgery by their primary doctors with a presumed indication based on such studies. In this situation, it is important to rule out not only FHH but also forms of secondary hyperparathyroidism in which surgery may not be appropriate. Furthermore, all localization studies have some false positives, and these can further confuse the picture. Negative localization studies, however, are not a contraindication for surgery. If the patient clearly meets the criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism based on blood and urine tests, then they should be referred to an experienced surgeon for consultation regardless of the localization tests. Given surgeon preference for imaging, it may be most efficient to hold off on ordering localization studies and simply refer the patient to an appropriate surgeon who can then arange for imaging.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Parotidectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nThe parotid gland is a primarily serous salivary gland that is located high in the neck in the preauricular area extending towards the cheek. The extratemporal facial nerve and its branches pass through the parotid gland and supply motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression, as well as to the postauricular muscles, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, and the stylohyoid muscles.\n\n\nThe motor branches to the face are divided into cervicofacial and temporofacial branches, with the former supplying the muscles of the mouth and neck and the latter supplying the muscles of the forehead and eye (there is some overlap in the nasal region). There is no anatomic feature that formally separates the parotid gland into superficial and deep lobes, but the plane of the facial nerve (see the image below) generally serves for demarcation of the superficial and deep portions of the gland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe surgical anatomy and landmarks of the facial nerve. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgical landmarks to the facial nerve include the tympanomastoid suture line, the tragal pointer, and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The tympanomastoid suture line lies between the mastoid and tympanic segments of the temporal bone and is approximately 6-8 mm lateral to the stylomastoid foramen. The main trunk of the nerve can also be found midway between (10 mm posteroinferior to) the cartilaginous tragal pointer of the external auditory canal and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The nerve is usually located inferior and medial to the pointer. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Facial Nerve Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\nA superficial (or lateral) parotidectomy involves removing all of the gland superficial to the facial nerve, whereas a partial superficial parotidectomy involves removing only the portion of the gland surrounding a tumor or mass. In a partial superficial parotidectomy, only some branches of the facial nerve are usually dissected, whereas in a formal superficial parotidectomy, the entire cervicofacial and temporofacial divisions are dissected.\n\nFor a total parotidectomy, the superficial gland is dissected free of all of the facial nerve branches to the extent feasible, and the branches are then completely mobilized and the deep portion of the gland removed. Many deep lobe or parapharyngeal parotid tumors can be approached transcervically rather than by means of parotidectomy; however, this transcervical technique is not discussed in this article.\n\nIndications\nNeoplasms are the most common indication for parotidectomy. The vast majority of primary parotid tumors are benign, but approximately 20% are found to be malignant. In addition, regional and distant disease can metastasize to the parotid and necessitate removal for diagnosis or cure.\n\nInflammatory processes (eg, chronic parotitis, deep salivary calculi, or parotid abscess) are occasionally treated with total parotidectomy, with the recognition that surgery in an inflamed gland probably carries a higher risk of postoperative facial nerve dysfunction.\n [1]  Salivary duct stones may be approached through minimal external paortid incisions, and are aided by sialendoscopy when possible. For further information on the workup and treatment of parotid sialadenitis and calculi, see Parotitis.\n\nSialorrhea is rarely treated with parotidectomy; more often, it is medically managed with antisialagogues or botulinum toxin or treated with duct ligation.\n\nContraindications\nPatients with benign tumors who are at high anesthetic risk may be observed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPatients with multiple parotid cysts should be tested for HIV before undergoing surgical excision. Benign lymphoepithelial cysts are relatively common in the HIV-positive population but otherwise uncommon. Because these cysts are usually multiple and tend to recur, they are typically managed by means of repeated aspiration or sclerotherapy rather than parotidectomy; they may also respond to antiretroviral therapy.\n [2] \n\nTechnical Considerations\nPositive identification and preservation of the facial nerve are essential for preventing inadvertent facial nerve injury. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the stylomastoid foramen, the facial nerve, and the parotid gland and its surrounding structures underlies identification and preservation of the nerve.\n\nWhenever possible, a normal cuff of parotid tissue should be resected around a tumor to prevent recurrence.\n [3] In the setting of a benign tumor, if a facial nerve branch is found directly on the tumor capsule, the nerve should be gently dissected off the tumor. In the setting of a malignancy, consideration should be given to sacrificing as opposed to preserving the nerve (see Technique).\n\nRaw gland surface contributes to postoperative salivary leakage (sialocele or salivary fistula). In addition, raw gland apposed to skin provides a ready pathway for postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to migrate from the salivary tissue and cross-innervate facial sweat glands, resulting in gustatory sweating (Frey syndrome).\n\nEfforts should be made to close the parotid capsule after removal of a parotid tumor or a portion of the gland. If closure of the capsule is not feasible, consideration should be given to interposing tissue (eg, dermal fat graft)\n [4] or implantable biologic material (eg, acellular dermis) between the raw gland and the skin.\n\nInjury to the posterior branch of the greater auricular nerve, which supplies sensation to the ear, is often avoidable. If the nerve must be cut, it can be marked with a stitch to facilitate reapproximation at the conclusion of the case. Patients should be warned to expect at least temporary earlobe numbness and should take precautions to prevent heat or cold injury to the insensate area (eg, frostbite or curling iron burns).\n\nClosed suction drainage is used in most cases to prevent postoperative hematoma or seroma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Peritonsillar Abscess Drainage Procedures": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe peritonsillar abscess (PTA) remains a common clinical entity in the emergency department and in an otolaryngology practice. The exact incidence has been estimated at 30 cases per 100,000 people per year.\nPTA is rare in infants and children younger than 12 years. The mean age for this disease is 20-30 years; males and females are affected equally. PTA usually occurs near the superior pole of the palatine tonsil, in the space outside of the tonsillar capsule between the superior constrictor and the palatopharyngeus muscle.\n [1] \n\n\nAn untreated PTA can lead to numerous complications, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nErosion of the carotid artery\n\n\n\n\nThe development of sepsis\n\n\n\n\nThe development of other localized serious bacterial infections, including mediastinitis and deep neck space infections, which arise from tracking of the infection from the tonsillar fossas to the deep fascial planes of the neck with extension into the chest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common treatments for PTAs include the following:\n [2, 3] \n\n\n\n\n\nNeedle aspiration: Needle aspiration can be therapeutic in itself; in some studies, up to 85% of patients were effectively treated with outpatient needle aspiration and oral antibiotics.\n [4, 5] Aspiration can also be used to confirm the diagnosis and localize the PTA for incision and drainage.\n\n\n\n\nIncision and drainage: Success rates of the incision and drainage technique are reported in the literature as similar to or slightly higher than reported success rates of the needle aspiration technique.\n\n\n\n\nQuinsy tonsillectomy: Quinsy is an obsolete term for PTA. The quinsy tonsillectomy, then, is a tonsillectomy performed in the presence of a PTA. The different techniques of tonsillectomy are not discussed in this article. For information, see Otolaryngology article Tonsillectomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one study, 60% of otolaryngologists in the United Kingdom used needle aspiration as the primary means of treating a peritonsillar abscess. If needle aspiration failed, 52% would then perform an incision and drainage.\n [6] \n\nIn another study of 20,546 weighted cases of PTA from 2000 to 2009 in children aged younger than 18 years, researchers found a significant increase in the rates of incison and drainage from 26.4% to 33.7% and a significant decrease in the rate of tonsillectomy from 13.0% to 7.8%.\n [7] \n\nMicrobiology of the peritonsillar abscess\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral studies have looked at the bacteriology of PTA aspirates. A mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is commonly isolated.\n [8, 9] The most common aerobic bacteria are Streptococcus group A (GAS), beta-hemolytic streptococci group C and G, and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common anaerobic bacteria isolated from PTA aspirates is Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN). FN is a gram-negative, obligate anaerobic, pleomorphic rod. It is also the pathogen most commonly associated with Lemierre syndrome.\n [10, 8] \n\n\n\n\nIn one study from Denmark, Fusobacterium was the most commonly isolated bacterium (23%), followed by group a streptococci (17%), and groups C and G streptococci (5% total for both groups).\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nSome controversy surrounds the need to obtain cultures after management of a PTA.\n [11] Gavriel et al did find that patients with anaerobic bacteria growth correlated with higher rates of recurrent PTAs, suggesting that the presence of anaerobic bacteria be a relative indication for tonsillectomy.\n [9] \n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe tonsils begin developing early in the third month of fetal life. They arise from the endoderm lining, the second pharyngeal pouch, and the mesoderm of the second pharyngeal membrane and adjacent regions of the first and second arches. The epithelium of the second pouch proliferates to form solid endodermal buds, growing into the underlying mesoderm; these buds give rise to tonsillar stroma. Central cells of the buds later die and slough, converting the solid buds into hollow tonsillar crypts, which are infiltrated by lymphoid tissue.\n\nBoth right and left tonsils form part of the circumpharyngeal lymphoid ring. The size of the tonsil varies according to the age, individuality, and pathologic status. At the fifth or sixth year of life, the tonsils rapidly increase in size, reaching their maximum size at puberty. At puberty, the tonsils measure 20-25 mm in vertical and 10-15 mm in transverse diameters.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Tonsil and Adenoid Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Petrosal Sinus Sampling": "\nBackground\n\n\nInferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) is an invasive procedure in which adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are sampled from the veins that drain the pituitary gland; these levels are then compared with the ACTH levels in the peripheral blood to determine whether a pituitary tumor (as opposed to an ectopic source of ACTH) is responsible for ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome. IPSS can also be used to establish on which side of the pituitary gland the tumor is located.\nCushing disease results from excessive cortisol production due to elevated ACTH levels produced by a pituitary tumor. In contrast, Cushing syndrome includes all conditions of hypercortisolism due to either ACTH-dependent causes (eg, Cushing disease or ectopic ACTH secretion by a nonpituitary tumor) or ACTH-independent causes (eg, excessive autonomous secretion of cortisol from a hyperfunctioning adrenocortical tumor).\n\n\nOther and rarer conditions that can lead to Cushing syndrome include ectopic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion, primary bilateral pigmented nodular adrenal hyperplasia, macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, ectopic actions of gastric inhibitory peptides, and other syndromes, such as McCune-Albright syndrome and Carney syndrome. Pseudo-Cushing states with similar clinical presentations may be found in depression and alcohol dependence. Cushingoid features may also be found in obesity.\nDifferentiating ACTH-dependent from ACTH-independent Cushing disease is often straightforward, but it can be difficult to differentiate Cushing disease from hypercortisolism caused by ectopic ACTH secretion (ie, from a nonpituitary source) owing to the cyclical and intermittent secretion by ACTH-secreting tumors and the varying sensitivities and specificities of the various biochemical tests.\n [1, 2] According to Prabhu et al (2002), the value of cross-sectional imaging in ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome is also restricted because small nonfunctioning pituitary incidentalomas are present in up to 10% of MRI scans performed in healthy young people.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nThe poor sensitivity of imaging for microadenomas of the pituitary is another problem.\n [4]  ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas are difficult to identify on standard 1.5T or 3T MRI as well as with dynamic contrast imaging.\n [5] In the majority of cases, routine thin slice contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI is able to provide anatomic detail and help identify the IPS drainage pattern. In some cases, when the drainage pattern cannot be identified, even spatial resolution does not help portray the complex anatomy.\n [6]  In such a situation, IPSS alone helps to differentiate Cushing disease from Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors\n [7] and is therefore still the gold standard for diagnosis of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas.\n [5, 8]  It is well established that IPSS can accurately diagnose Cushing disease and it is also known that MRI provides greater accuracy in localizing the site of the adenoma.\n [9] Kakade et al.\n [10] have suggested that in case of equivocal MRI pituitary findings, prior IPSS can avoid unnecessary transsphenoidal surgery. One study reports that 7T MRI may help to detect standard 1.5T and 3T MRI-negative Cushing disease and may preempt IPSS in the future.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nHistory of petrosal sinus sampling\nIPSS was introduced in 1977 by Corrigan et al, who reported the use of unilateral selective catheterization and venous sampling to localize ACTH secretion in a patient with a perplexing clinical and laboratory picture compatible with either ectopic ACTH secretion or pituitary-dependent Cushing syndrome. Later, it was established that the ACTH levels in the pituitary venous drainage may be asymmetric, owing either to the location of the corticotroph adenoma or asymmetric variations in venous anatomy.\n\nPituitary venous drainage is usually ipsilateral, so the venous drainage on the contralateral side relative to the adenoma does not often have a high concentration of ACTH. Doppman et al (1984) suggested simultaneous sampling from both inferior petrosal sinuses (IPSs) to avoid false-negative results in the presence of a pituitary corticotroph adenoma. This procedure was termed bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS).\n [11] \n\nMany corticotroph adenomas are susceptible to stimulation by exogenously administered CRH, as was first described in 1991 by Oldfield et al to increase the sensitivity of BIPSS.\n [12] Two different forms of CRH have been used in the various studies reported: ovine CRH (oCRH) and human CRH (hCRH). Nieman et al (1989) have reported that the peripheral ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH were significantly higher than with human CRH.\n [13] \n\nFuture and controversies\nSome centers have reported improved accuracy and intrasellar localization with bilateral cavernous sinus sampling,\n [14, 15] but there is an increased risk of cranial nerve palsy,\n [16] so this technique has not yet gained popularity.\n\nInternal jugular venous sampling (IJVS) has also been attempted as a technically easier alternative to BIPSS. Radvany et al. compared IJVS with IPSS in 30 consecutive patients with MRI-negative ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome. Their results indicate that IJVS is not as helpful as IPSS in diagnosing the pituitary as the source of excessive ACTH.\n [8] Although IJVS has specificity similar to that of BIPSS, it has a lower sensitivity (83% versus 94%), according to Ilias et al.\n [17] \n\nUsing samples drawn from IPSS, Oklu et al\n [18] have identified 3 small compound potential biomarkers of Cushing disease (pyridoxate, deoxycholic acid, and trimethyl adipate). These may elucidate tumor biology and suggest, in the future, possible diagnostic molecular imaging probes and therapeutic targets in patients with recurrent disease after surgery.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nA detailed description of the IPS anatomy has been provided by Miller and Doppman (1991) (see image below).\n [19] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferior Petrosal Sinus Anatomy \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn most individuals, the IPS narrows to become a single vein, emptying into the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (IJV). In about 25% of individuals, the IPS drainage forms a plexus of channels that empty into the IJV.\n [20] In 0.6%-7% of individuals, there is no connection between the IJV and the IPS, making standard sampling impossible.\n [19, 21] \n\nIn approximately 60% of individuals, pituitary venous drainage is symmetrical,\n [22] with most of the venous effluent from each side of the pituitary draining in to the ipsilateral IPS.\n [19] As a result, in most people, BIPSS can be an effective tool to lateralize corticotroph adenomas and to avoid false-negative results.\n\nDoppman et al (1999) attributed the 0.8% prevalence of false-negative results to a hypoplastic or anomalous IPS.\n [23] Shiu et al (1968) first described a classification system for the IPS anatomic variants.\n [21] Bonelli et al (2000) have described a modification of Shiu et al’s classification system, as follows:\n [24] \n\n\n\n\n\nType I (see image below): An IPS anastomosing with the IJV; the anterior condylar vein is absent or joins the IPS at a defined origin; the short segment of the vein from the point of this anastomosis to the IJV is termed the inferior condylar confluence\n\n\n\n\n\nIPS variant type 1 \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType II (see image below): A common origin of the IPS and anterior condylar vein with the IJV\n\n\n\n\n\nIPS variant type 2 \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType III (see image below): An IPS consisting of several small channels communicating with the IJV\n\n\n\n\n\nIPS variant type 3 \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType IV (see image below): An IPS that communicates with the anterior condylar vein and not the IJV\n\n\n\n\n\nIPS variant type 4 \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pneumatic Otoscope Examination": "\nOverview\n\n\nPneumatic otoscopy is an examination that allows determination of the mobility of a patient’s tympanic membrane (TM) in response to pressure changes. The normal tympanic membrane moves in response to pressure. Immobility may be due to fluid in the middle ear, a perforation, or tympanosclerosis, among other reasons.\n [1] The detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion (OME).\n [2] \nThe predictive value of visible eardrum characteristics for OME ranges widely.\n [3] Therefore, pneumatic otoscopy is important, as it can indicate the presence of effusion even when the appearance of the eardrum otherwise gives no indication of middle ear pathology. Pneumatic otoscopy has been found to have a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing middle ear effusion.\n [4, 5, 6, 7] It has also been shown to do as well as or better than tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry, and it is especially useful in a setting in which tympanometry is not readily available.\n [8] Other advantages are that it is cheap and easy to perform with appropriate training.\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe primary functionality of the middle ear (tympanic cavity) is that of bony conduction of sound via transference of sound waves in the air collected by the auricle to the fluid of the inner ear. The middle ear inhabits the petrous portion of the temporal bone and is filled with air secondary to communication with the nasopharynx via the auditory (eustachian) tube.\n\n\n\n\nThe tympanic membrane (TM) is an oval, thin, semi-transparent membrane that separates the external and middle ear (tympanic cavity). The TM is divided into 2 parts: the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The manubrium of the malleus is firmly attached to the medial tympanic membrane; where the manubrium draws the TM medially, a concavity is formed. The apex of this concavity is called the umbo. The area of the TM superior to the umbo is termed the pars flaccida; the remainder of the TM is the pars tensa.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Polysomnography": "\nOverview\n\n\nNocturnal, laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG), also known as a sleep study, is the most commonly used test in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). A sleep study can be used for diagnosing other sleep disorders as well, including periodic limb movement disorder, narcolepsy, chronic insomnia, and REM sleep behavior disorder. It is often considered the criterion standard for diagnosing OSAS, determining the severity of the disease, and evaluating various other sleep disorders that can exist with or without OSAS. PSG is non-invasive and consists of a simultaneous recording of multiple physiologic parameters related to sleep and wakefulness. See the image below. Home-based, limited-channel sleep studies are being used more often to diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea, but they have some limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical polysomnogram tracing.

However, night-to-night variability may exist in patients who have a high probability but a low apnea index. In addition, variability in laboratory equipment, scoring technique, and interscorer reliability may also play roles. As is well known, PSG scoring also usually varies from laboratory to laboratory.\n\n\n\n\nPSG is used to evaluate abnormalities of sleep and/or wakefulness and other physiologic disorders that have an impact on or are related to sleep and/or wakefulness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Posterior Epistaxis Nasal Pack": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nEpistaxis is a common problem in the emergency department (ED). Although it usually is relatively benign, it can produce serious, life-threatening situations. Up to 60% of the population is estimated to have had at least 1 episode of epistaxis at some point in their lives. Of this group, 6% seek medical care to treat epistaxis, with 1.6 in 10,000 requiring hospitalization.\n [1] \n\n\nA patient with epistaxis must be evaluated expediently.\n [2, 3, 4] All patients with epistaxis require a thorough examination and control of the bleeding. Epistaxis that has resolved still requires management to prevent rebleeding.\n [5] \nTen percent of epistaxes are posterior, exhibiting massive bleeding that is initially bilateral. Posterior epistaxis may present in ways that suggest a more inferiorly located site of bleeding from the aerodigestive tract (eg, hemoptysis, melena, anemia, or just nausea). A posterior source of the bleeding must be sought when epistaxis is bilateral, brisk, and not controlled with anterior nasal packing. \n\n\n\n\nPosterior epistaxis is usually treated by an otolaryngologist, but an emergency practitioner may be called upon to treat this condition in a medical environment with few support services. \n\n\n\n\nA focused history aids the clinician in managing the acutely bleeding patient. This history should include some or all of the following questions: \n\n\n\n\n\nWhich side is bleeding?\n\n\n\n\nWhich side was bleeding initially?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the estimated amount of blood loss?\n\n\n\n\nIs it recurrent?\n\n\n\n\nIs it in the pharynx?\n\n\n\n\nHas any trauma recently occurred?\n\n\n\n\nAre symptoms of hypovolemia present?\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the patient’s past medical history and current medications (eg, aspirin, warfarin)?\n [6] \n\n\n\nAs with any unstable patient, initial management begins by assessing the ABCs (A irway, B reathing, and C irculation). Next, the source of the bleed should be identified by a thorough examination of the nasopharynx.\n\nA posterior pack is placed to occlude the choanal arch and, in conjunction with an anterior nasal pack, provide hemostasis. Posterior packing can be accomplished with gauze, a Foley catheter, a nasal sponge/tampon, or an inflatable nasal balloon catheter. Posterior packing is very uncomfortable and may necessitate procedural sedation. An anterior nasal pack is always required on the side of a posterior pack, and a contralateral nasal pack is strongly encouraged to maintain the septum midline.\n [5] \n\nFor more information, see Epistaxis, Management of Acute Epistaxis, and Anterior Epistaxis Nasal Pack.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe nose, like the rest of the face, has an abundant blood supply. The arterial supply to the nose may be principally divided into (1) branches from the internal carotid, namely the branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries from the ophthalmic artery, and (2) branches from the external carotid, namely the sphenopalatine, greater palatine, superior labial, and angular arteries. \n\nThe bleeding site of a posterior epistaxis is either posterior to the middle turbinate or at the posterior superior aspect of the nasal cavity. Branches of the sphenopalatine artery supply the blood for such an epistaxis (see the image below).

        "Presurgical Orthopedic Therapy for Cleft Lip and Palate": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nIn presurgical orthopedic therapy, orthodontic techniques are used to mold the maxillary, alveolar, and nasal tissues of an infant with a unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate.\n [1] Other terms used for these techniques are neonatal infant orthopedics, presurgical infant orthopedics, and nasal-alveolar molding.\n [2] Because the infant does not yet have teeth, the term orthodontics would be inaccurate; thus, orthopedics is the preferred term.\n\n\nThe use of presurgical orthopedic therapy is widespread; 47-51% of neonates treated for cleft lip and palate in the United Kingdom have presurgical appliances.\n [3] In the United States and Canada, 71% of centers reported using some form of presurgical molding before bilateral cleft lip surgery, with nasoalveolar molding being the most popular at 55% of those using this treatment.\n [4] \nTwo categories of appliances are used: passive and active. Active appliances are fixed intraorally and apply traction through mechanical means such as elastic chains, screws, and plates.\n [5, 6] Passive appliances maintain the distance between the 2 maxillary segments while external force is applied to the primarily to reposition it posteriorly. The nasoalveolar molding device (see the image below) is a very elaborate passive device; it consists of an intraoral acrylic plate held in place with extraoral elastics and tape. In later phases of treatment, wire outriggers are added that apply protracting force to the vestibule of the nares, lengthening the columella.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA nasoalveolar molding device. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal force can be applied by external taping of the lip, a head cap with elastic straps across the prolabium, or a surgical lip adhesion.\n [7] See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA child with unilateral cleft lip and palate being treated with tape adhesion. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPresurgical orthopedic devices are a controversial topic in cleft treatment. Arguments against their use include the potential for long-term growth effects and potential feeding difficulty.\n [8, 9] With increasing clinical experience, the long-term outcome and the specific role of presurgical orthopedics are becoming better defined.\n [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] Empirically, molding can narrow the width of clefts and make subsequent surgery less technically demanding. The long-term outcomes of individuals treated with this protocol will determine its future acceptance.\n\nIndications\nIndications for the use of presurgical orthopedic therapy are evolving. Advantages include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovement in soft tissue form, reducing the need for surgical dissection\n [15, 16] \n\n\n\n\nThe ability to perform either primary bone grafting or gingivoperiosteoplasty, which could potentially reduce the need for secondary bone grafts\n [17, 18, 19] \n\n\n\n\nThe potential for improved feeding efficiency owing to cleft narrowing and obturation; Masarei et al, however, found that presurgical orthopedic therapy did not improve feeding efficiency in treated infants\n [20] \n\n\n\nContraindications\nContraindications include a lack of family and patient compliance or acceptance of the device.\n\nOutcomes\nSeveral large case control studies have demonstrated adverse outcomes in protocols using active presurgical orthopedic therapy. Henkeland and Gundlach reported that the Latham-Millard active orthopedic device had an adverse effect on facial growth.\n [21] Berkowitz reported worsened occlusal outcomes in the patients treated with the Latham-Millard device.\n [22] Matic and Power found maxillary growth to be decreased after active presurgical orthopedic therapy in unilateral and bilateral clefts, respectively.\n [23, 24] They also found that almost all patients treated with gingivoperiosteoplasty or primary bone graft also required secondary bone grafting.\n\nStudies of passive-treatment presurgical orthopedic therapy have shown a more mixed outcome. Wood et al reported that the passive nasoalveolar molding device and primary gingivoperiosteoplasty did not cause an unfavorable effect on facial growth.\n [25] For patients treated with a nasoalveolar molding device and a primary gingivoperiosteoplasty, Santiago et al reported a reduced need for secondary alveolar bone grafts.\n [26] Shetty et al, however, found better outcomes in patients on whom the nasoalveolar molding treatment had begun within 1 year of life, as opposed to those in whom treatment began later.\n [27] \n\nPreoperative treatment with nasoalveolar molding seems to improve results of nasal shape, especially in bilateral clefts.\n [28] Garfinkle et al presented a series of patients with bilateral cleft lip and palate treated with a nasoalveolar molding protocol who required no further intervention for nasal reconstruction beyond their initial repair.\n [29] Nazrian-Mobin et al found that nasoalveolar molding improved the nasal columnar length and width much better in patients with bilateral clefts than in those with unilateral clefts.\n [30] \n\nBongaarts et al reported on results from the multicenter Dutch cleft experience; they found that presurgical orthopedic therapy with a passive acrylic plate similar to the nasoalveolar molding system showed no improvement in occlusal outcomes.\n [31] Uzel and Alparslan published a meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials and 4 case-controlled trials with presurgical orthopedic therapy appliances; they found no long-term positive effects on the studied treatment outcomes in patients with cleft lip and palate.\n [32] Van der Heijden et al in a meta-analysis of 12 studies of presurgical orthopedic treatment of unilateral cleft lip found inconsistent results on nasal symmetry.\n [33] Both authors of the meta-analyses concluded that studies were heterogeneous and more randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of different surgical protocols.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe lips surround the entrance to the oral cavity. The upper lip extends from the base of the nose superiorly to the nasolabial folds laterally and to the free edge of the vermilion border inferiorly. The lower lip extends from the superior free vermilion edge superiorly, to the commissures laterally, and to the mandible inferiorly. Around the circumferential vermilion-skin border, a fine line of pale skin accentuates the color difference between the vermilion and normal skin. Along the upper vermilion-skin border, 2 paramedian elevations of the vermilion form the Cupid bow. Two raised vertical columns of tissue form a midline depression called the philtrum. The philtrum is located between the paramedian elevations of the vermilion and the columella above.\n\nThe oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx directly below the soft palate that communicates anteriorly with the oral cavity proper by the isthmus of the fauces, also known as the oropharyngeal isthmus. Specifically, the oropharyngeal isthmus is bound superiorly by the soft palate, laterally by the palatoglossal arches, and inferiorly by the posterior third of the tongue. The most prominent feature of the oropharynx is the two folds that are termed the pillars of the fauces, the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch. The palatoglossal arch contains the palatoglossus muscle and travels anteroinferiorly from the soft palate to the lateral aspect of the tongue.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Lips and Perioral Region Anatomy and Pharynx Anatomy.

        "Radiofrequency Turbinate Reduction": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe most common cause of nasal obstruction is mucosal hypertrophy of the inferior turbinate, followed by structural deformity of the nasal airway (septal deviation, bony inferior turbinate hypertrophy).\n [1] Medical treatment strategies include oral and intranasal antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, saline rinses, and allergen immunotherapy, as well as short-term agents such as oral and topical  decongestants. When these treatment options fail, surgical options such as corticosteroid injections, cryosurgery, electrocautery ablation, turbinate out-fracture, microdebrider-assisted inferior turbinoplasty (MAIT), submucous resection, and partial turbinate resection may be considered. The goal of inferior turbinate surgery is to reduce the size of the turbinate without compromising the turbinate's ability to facilitate mucociliary clearance, air humidification, or maintenance of laminar airflow. There is currently no consensus on the most effective technique.\nRadiofrequency turbinate reduction (RFTR) is a minimally invasive surgical option that can reduce tissue volume in a precise, targeted manner. This technique uses electrical currents in the range of radiofrequency waves to produce heat around the electrode, thereby creating lesions within the submucosal tissue of the turbinate.\n [2, 3] The heat produced is sufficient to cause cellular apoptosis of unwanted, redundant tissue while being sufficiently selective to spare nearby tissue of untoward effects. This technique can be used with monopolar or bipolar electrodes. Long-term efficacy is identical between the two, though monopolar ablation is associated with less pain and earlier symptom improvement.\n [4, 5] Radiofrequency turbinate reduction differs fundamentally from traditional methods by using low-power radiofrequency energy to provide a relatively quick and painless procedure for tissue coagulation.\n\n\nAn explanatory video of the procedure is below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiofrequency turbinate reduction.

Topical aerosolized lidocaine was administered; 1% lidocaine with 1:100K epinephrine was slowly injected into the turbinate. Two lesions were placed on this side. Ideally, the lesion is placed slightly deeper to avoid the mild mucosal ischemia seen toward the end of energy delivery. Video courtesy of Vijay R Ramakrishnan, MD. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThere have been multiple studies completed analyzing the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) turbinate reduction. In 2009, Hyotnen et al completed a systematic literature review of the RFA technique and concluded that overall, the technique is well tolerated and effective.\n [6]  Duran used blinded reviews of pre and posttreatment CT scans to quantify reduction after RFA and found greater than 25% reduction in size of the inferior turbinates after treatment.\n [7] Conflicting evidence has been presented regarding potential alteration of nasal histology and reduced mucociliary clearance times, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions at this time.\n [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] \n\nAdditionally, multiple reviews comparing RFA with MAIT have been published. Lui et al showed no statistically significant difference in outcomes between the techniques at 6 months; however, maintenance of improvement at 3 years was significantly better in the MAIT group.\n [13] Results also suggest that although RFA and MAIT both result in a statistically significant reduction in nasal blockage, MAIT is more effective in decreasing nasal volume,\n [14]  though this is disputed by Bakshi et al.\n [15] \n\nOverall, RFA has a low complication rate, can be done in the office setting under local anesthesia, and has been shown to reduce nasal obstruction secondary to inferior turbinate hypertrophy; some studies suggest advantages to microdebrider turbinoplasty as an alternative for surgical treatment of inferior turbinate hypertrophy.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe lateral nasal walls contain 3 pairs each of small, thin bones: the superior, middle, and inferior conchae, which form the bony framework of the turbinates. These bones are covered in nasal ciliated mucosa. The inferior turbinate runs from anterior to posterior along the majority of the length of the nasal cavity attaching to the lateral nasal wall. The attachment point of the inferior turbinate is on the medial maxillary wall and just inferior to the maxillary sinus ostium. Inferior to the head (anterior aspect) of the inferior turbinate lies the inferior meatus, also referred to as Hasner’s valve. This is the drainage opening of the lacrimal system. It is most commonly visualized as a vertical sulcus.\n [16]  \n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Rigid Rhinoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe development of a rod lens system by Harold H. Hopkins in 1959 and the coupling of this system with a fiber optic light transmission technology by Karl Storz in 1960 marked a breakthrough in modern endoscopic surgery. The Hopkins rod-lens endoscope system consists of a series of glass rod lenses separated by air and fiberoptic bundles surrounding the lens for transmission of light. Today, the rigid endoscope (see the image below) allows otolaryngologists to perform nasal endosocopy (rigid rhinoscopy) for both routine diagnostic examinations and complex, minimally invasive sinus surgery.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0 mm and 3.0 mm rigid nasal endoscopes. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nThe \"rod-lens\" system of image transmission was a simple but radical departure from the lens system then in use. Instead of an air interspace between glass lenses, Hopkins used solid glass rods with lenses cemented between them. This dramatically increased light transmission and image definition and yielded images of a quality never before seen. These scopes provide a much wider viewing angle and smaller diameter than its predecessors, with improved resolution, contrast, and brightness. For more background on Hopkins or Storz, the author recommends 2 wonderful articles by Linder et al and Morgenstern.\n\n\n\n\nToday, endosocopy can be coupled with high-definition video and digital image-capturing systems to provide brilliant images for education. Currently, most otolaryngologists use telescopes ranging from 2.7–4 mm in diameter. Endoscopes are also available with angled lenses (30º, 45º, 70º) allowing for better visualization of the skull base, ethmoid, maxillary, and frontal sinuses. All of the images seen in this chapter are from a standard rigid rhinoscope.\n\n\n\n\nRigid rhinoscopy allows for a complete and detailed visualization of the nasal mucosa, turbinates, and nasopharynx. This examination can be performed on adults and children who are able to cooperate with the examination. A wide variety of indications exist for rigid rhinoscopy, including inspection for inflammation in the mucosal membranes, the presence of purulent secretions, turbinate enlargement, or nasal polyps.\n\nKey considerations\nA high-intensity light source is required. Most commercially available unites use halogen or xenon lamps. Xenon is white and the most natural in color. Halogen sources produce a slightly yellow light. Light from the light source is transmitted to the telescope through a fiberoptic light cable. Optical fibers are long, thin strands of glass that are bundled together to form cables. Light is passed from the light source through the optical fibers and flexible cable, without much degradation of the light signal. The light cable is attached to the telescope and the light continues through the rigid telescope. The scopes can be attached via a small video camera (charge-coupled device) to allow the surgeon to look at the video image on a monitor. Current generations of video camera integrate high-definition signals, allowing for 1080p images.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe septum is a midline bony and cartilaginous structure that divides the nose into 2 similar halves. Regarding the lateral nasal wall and paranasal sinuses, the superior, middle, and inferior concha form corresponding superior, middle, and inferior meatus on the lateral nasal wall. The superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid cells and the sphenoid sinus. The middle meatus provides drainage of anterior ethmoid and the maxillary and frontal sinuses. The inferior meatus provides drainage of the nasolacrimal duct.\n\nThe internal nasal valve involves the area bounded by upper lateral cartilage, septum, nasal floor, and anterior head of the inferior turbinate. This makes up the narrowest portion of the nasal airway in the leptorrhine nose.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nThe following are the usual indications for performing rigid rhinoscopy:\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and examination of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and nasopharynx\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the turbinates and nasal septum, which can contribute to nasal airway obstruction.\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance of previously diagnosed (treated or untreated) tumors of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and nasopharynx\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and treatment of epistaxis\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nRemoval of nasal foreign bodies\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain biopsies for the diagnosis of nasal masses\n\n\n\n\nTo perform therapeutic procedures such as irrigation, obtaining cultures, and balloon dilation of the sinuses\n\n\n\n\nRemove old blood, packing, or scar tissue after nasal or sinus surgery\n\n\n\n\nAs a part of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)\n\n\n\nContraindications\nNo absolute contraindications exist. Relative contraindications to rigid rhinoscopy include a lack of patient cooperation.\n\nEndosocopic ataging\nNasal endoscopy and imaging are the 2 most widely used objective measures in the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Endoscopy has multiple uses in the management of patients with sinonasal symptoms and plays an important role in both the preoperative and postoperative management of patients.\n\nThe Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scoring system quantifies the pathologic states of the nose and paranasal sinuses. The scoring system assesses for the presence of polyps, discharge, edema, scarring, or adhesions and crusting. Endoscopic staging is performed bilaterally and typically takes place during the initial evaluation, preoperatively, postoperatively, and at regular intervals (3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months recommended).\n\nThe scores range from 0–20. Polyps are graded as absent (0), present in middle meatus (1), or present beyond the middle meatus (3). Discharge is graded as not present (0), thin (1), or thick and purulent (2). Edema, scarring, and crusting are each graded as absent (0), mild (1), or severe (2). Interrater agreement studies examining the reliability of the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scoring system demonstrate that in a high proportion of cases, 2 independent observers agree on the examination findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Rotary Chair Testing": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe visual and vestibular systems interact to maintain visual clarity of objects during head movement. The reflex that makes this possible is known as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) (see the image below). It permits individuals to perform such routine activities as reading street signs while walking down a sidewalk. Like many other systems in the body, most individuals are unaware of the VOR and its basic functioning until it does not function properly. Vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, nausea, vomiting, and other similar symptoms often characterize dysfunction of the vestibular system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vestibulo-ocular reflex. A rotation of the head is detected, which triggers an inhibitory signal to the extraocular muscles on one side and an excitatory signal to the muscles on the other side. The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nPatients who present with symptoms of vestibular dysfunction often undergo a detailed diagnostic workup including a standard electronystagmography (ENG) battery, posturography, and audiometry.\n [1, 2] Caloric testing is routinely performed in most vestibular laboratories as part of a vestibular dysfunction workup. Caloric testing is used to assess the integrity of the peripheral vestibular system through stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canals.\n [3] The stimulus of warm, cool, or ice water is equivalent to rotational stimulation at a frequency of 0.002-0.004 Hz. These levels of stimulation are significantly lower than those experienced by the VOR system on a daily basis and may not identify dysfunction at higher frequencies.\nIn addition, caloric results may be abnormal in individuals with congenital abnormalities such as atretic or stenotic external auditory canals, with anatomic variations such as a thickened temporal bone, or with certain acquired disorders such as a severely atelectatic or absent tympanic membrane or fluid in the middle ear. Thus, an additional test is needed to assess the integrity of the VOR.\n\n\n\n\nRotational chair commonly stimulates frequencies in the 0.01-1.28 Hz range. Head autorotation, an alternative method of testing VOR, stimulates frequencies of 1-6 Hz. This test is discussed in greater detail in the Medscape Reference article Vestibuloocular Reflex Testing.\n\n\n\n\nVOR testing is often performed with the use of a rotary chair. Rotational chair testing was first introduced by Bárány in 1907. He initially designed the chair for VOR testing with impulsive rotation in mind. The test consisted of manual rotation of the chair 10 times over 20 seconds followed by a sudden stop of the chair to analyze the postrotary nystagmus. Rotational chair testing has undergone numerous changes since that time and now has additional applications, including testing of visual-vestibular interaction, optokinetic after-nystagmus (OKAN), high-velocity sinusoidal testing, and off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR). Some of the newer applications require more sophisticated equipment than that developed by Bárány.\n\nBackground\nAs previously stated, the visual and vestibular systems interact to maintain visual clarity of objects during locomotion and other head movement. The fovea (see the image below) is the part of the eye that has the greatest density of photoreceptors and therefore is the area with the best visual acuity. An object is most clearly viewed when it is centered on the fovea. During motion, the image of the viewed object tends to slip from the fovea, causing it to blur. In fact, visual acuity declines to 50% when an object is 2° from the center of the fovea.\n [4] To maintain an object on the fovea, the eye must make corrective responses. These corrective eye movements, known as nystagmus, have a slow phase and a quick phase. The vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) slow phase keeps the eyes on the foveal vision (opposite direction to head movement).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic diagram of the human eye, with the fovea at the bottom. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nMany different types of nystagmus exist, some of which are physiologic and others of which are pathologic. During rotational chair testing, the alert patient's eyes move in a direction opposite to the rotation of the chair. As the globe reaches an eccentric position within the orbit, a corrective response attempts to move it back to the center of the orbit. The nystagmus that is observed is a physiologic response and is observed with acceleration and deceleration of rotation. Sustained rotation results in a decline of this nystagmus. Multiple methods of rotation exist, each of which was designed to analyze vestibular responses by observation of the eye movements.\n\nThe rotational chair has primarily been used for analyzing horizontal canal VOR.\n [5] Rotation of the chair is performed with the assumption that the stimulus applied to the whole body is the same as a stimulus that is applied to the head. Therefore, the head should be secured to the chair during rotation. In addition, most commercially available test protocols do not exceed a frequency of 1 Hz because the skin may move relative to the skull at frequencies greater than 1 Hz, thereby nullifying the assumption.\n [6] \n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe vestibular system, which is the system of balance, consists of 5 distinct end organs: 3 semicircular canals that are sensitive to angular accelerations (head rotations) and 2 otolith organs that are sensitive to linear (or straight-line) accelerations.\n\nThe semicircular canals (see the image below) are arranged as a set of 3 mutually orthogonal sensors; that is, each canal is at a right angle to the other 2. This is similar to the way 3 sides of a box meet at each corner and are at a right angle to one another. Furthermore, each canal is maximally sensitive to rotations that lie in the plane of the canal. The result of this arrangement is that 3 canals can uniquely specify the direction and amplitude of any arbitrary head rotation. The canals are organized into functional pairs wherein both members of the pair lie in the same plane. Any rotation in that plane is excitatory to one of the members of the pair and inhibitory to the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the labyrinth. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Vestibular System Anatomy, Visual System Anatomy, Extraocular Muscle Actions, Extraocular Muscle Anatomy, and Inner Ear Anatomy.

        "Sialendoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nAnatomy\nA thorough understanding of salivary gland anatomy is important for successful sialendoscopy. The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands and is found over the mandibular ramus just anterior to the ear canal. The parotid duct is named Stensen’s duct. The duct lies 1.5cm inferior to the zygomatic arch and runs parallel to it. It travels superficial to masseter muscle and then pierces the buccinator before entering the oral cavity. The papilla of the duct can be found in the oral cavity at the second maxillary molar. The duct is about 4-6cm long with a diameter averaging 0.5-1.4mm. The papilla is the narrowest portion of the duct however the masseteric bend can prove challenging to navigate during sialendoscopy. The parotid duct is on an average about 3 mm in diameter. In terms of access, it is the easier duct to cannulate but more difficult to navigate. The unique challenges working with the parotid duct are the likelihood of salivary leak into the cheek or masseteric space in the event of duct perforation and proximity to the buccal divisions of the facial nerve. Stones and strictures anterior to the masseter  can be approached transorally and those posterior to the anterior border will require an external parotid approach is a combined (endoscopic and open) procedure is being contemplated. \n\n\nThe submandibular gland lies inferior to the floor of mouth extending into the submandibular triangle of the neck. The submandibular duct is named Wharton’s duct. It averages 5cm in length and 0.5-1.5mm in diameter. The duct starts at the medial gland and runs between the mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles. The duct enters the oral cavity at the floor of mouth just lateral to the lingual frenulum. The path of the duct is more direct than Stensen’s however the papilla can be narrow and challenging to cannulate; consequently the Wharton's duct is difficulty to enter but easier to navigate. The unique challenge with the submandibular ductal system include its relation to the the sublingual gland and duct; injury to either during sialodochotomy can increase the likelihood of developing floor mouth and plunging ranulas. Also, the proximity of the lingual nerve to the duct  as it crosses from a lateral position posteriorly, below the nerve to a more medial position to the duct anteriorly must be borne in mind to reduce traction and direct injury to the duct during complex stone removal and combined technique; injury to the lingual nerve can lead to temporary or permanent taste disturbance and loss of sensation to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue on the side of the injury. Patients with lingual nerve paresis or palsy report metallic taste in the mouth or tongue numbness. \nBackground\nWhereas traditional methods of treating nonneoplastic disorders of the salivary gland include watchful observation, medical treatment, and surgical excision of the involved salivary gland, sialendoscopy is a relatively new procedure that allows endoscopic transluminal visualization of major salivary glands and offers a mechanism for diagnosing and treating both inflammatory and obstructive pathology related to the ductal system.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common nonneoplastic pathology for which sialendoscopy is indicated is salivary stones. The most common area of origin for sialoliths (80%) is the submandibular gland. Nineteen percent occur in the parotid gland, and 1% are found in the sublingual glandular system. Sialolithiasis is most frequently found in adults, but it may also present in children.\n [2] \n\nSialendoscopy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. It is complementary to diagnostic techniques such as plain radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance sialography, and conventional sialography, all of which are traditional, time-tested methods for evaluating the salivary ductal system.\n [3, 4] \n\nUltrasonography of the salivary glands has gained popularity because it is noninvasive, repeatable, and offers excellent definition of the salivary gland, detecting stones 1.5 mm or greater in size with 95-99.5% sensitivity.\n [5] Limitations of ultrasonography include limited assessment of the deep portion of the submandibular gland and portion of the parotid gland behind the mandible. In addition, its value is highly operator dependent.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) can be used to identify the location, diameter, and orientation of the calculi.\n\nLimitations of both CT and ultrasonography include distinguishing stones not visible or detectable on imaging from stenosis, owing to the diameter of the duct distal to the obstruction.\n\nIn these cases, magnetic resonance (MR) sialography, a new technique using saliva as the contrast medium to enhance the luminal anatomy of the salivary glands, can be helpful in treatment planning.\n [2] \n\nDespite its apparent simplicity, sialendoscopy is a technically challenging procedure that requires organized and sequential learning.\n [1] Once the procedure has been mastered, success rates can exceed 85% for both diagnostic and interventional applications.\n [1, 6, 7] \n\nIndications\nCurrent evidence validates sialendoscopy for the treatment of nonneoplastic disorders of the salivary glands, including sialolithiasis.\n [8, 9] Sialolithiasis is one of the most common of these disorders and is a major cause of sialadenitis and unilateral diffuse swelling of the major salivary glands.\n [1, 6] Other common indications for sialendoscopy include diagnostic evaluation of recurrent unexplained swelling of the major salivary glands associated with meals, ductal stenosis, and intraductal masses.\n [6, 10] \n\nA few series have also suggested benefit in patients with radioiodine-induced sialadenitis.\n [11, 12] Patients with refractory symptoms from any salivary gland pathology that does not respond to conservative management may benefit from interventional sialendoscopy, which yields success rates of 50-67%.\n [10, 12] Several studies, as well as the authors’ experience, suggest benefit in children with recurrent parotitis and also in patients who have recurrent sialadenitis from autoimmune processes such as Sjögren syndrome. In fact, Vashishta and Gillespie reported the use of biopsies to diagnose Sjögren syndrome in 31% of cases, despite previous negative serology.\n [13]  Other researchers looked at the use of sialendoscopy with steroid duct irrigation in patients with Sjorgren's syndrome and found an 87% postoperative reduction in the mean number of episodes of glandular swelling following steroid irrigations.\n [33] \n\nMarchal et al have proposed an algorithm for stone management that is based on stone size (see the image below).\n [1] In general, smaller stones (< 4 mm in the submandibular gland, < 3 mm in the parotid gland) are amenable to endoscopic removal. Intermediate-size stones (5-7 mm) may have to be fragmented further with either a holmium laser or lithotripsy before endoscopic extraction. Large stones (> 8 mm) usually necessitate the use of a combined technique for stone removal.\n [14, 15, 7, 16, 17, 18] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm depicting management of recurrent glandular swelling caused by salivary stones. Management is based on stone size: small, intermediate, or large. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn addition to size, stone management can also be affected by location (proximal or distal duct, or intra-glandular), number of stones, if the stone is impacted or freely mobile in the duct, and surgeon experience.\n [2] In general, early management with sialendoscopy predicts a more favorable outcome. The longer the disease duration, the larger and more fixed the stones are likely to be. However, long duration of sialolithiasis does not preclude a patient from being eligible for an endoscopic approach.\n [19] \n\nIn terms of stenosis, Koch et al recommend a transoral approach for stones located in the distal third of the Wharton duct. Similarly, a transoral approach combined with sialendoscopy is feasible for parotid stenoses that are located just at the papilla or the distal most portion of the parotid duct, distal to the masseteric bend. However, if the stenosis is located in the proximal, hilar, or posthilar ductal system, then interventional sialendoscopy with or without a combined approach technique is recommended.\n [20] \n\nContraindications\nThe only contraindication for sialendoscopy is acute sialadenitis.\n [6] Although this condition is not an absolute contraindication, it makes sialendoscopy problematic because an inflamed ductal system is more difficult to dilate. In addition, use of the rigid dilator system, a semirigid endoscope, or both during an acute episode of sialadenitis increases the chance of ductal trauma and potentially fosters the spread of infection in the soft tissues of the head and neck.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nSuccessful outcomes depend on correct technique, which can be acquired through training and appropriate patient selection. This is especially true for sialolithiasis. Endoscopic stone removal is recommended for stones smaller than 4 mm in submandibular cases and smaller than 3 mm in parotid cases. Removal of larger stones requires previous fragmentation by modalities such as external lithotripsy or laser.\n [1] \n\nWhen the stones are very large or when preoperative assessment suggests that endoscopic removal will be difficult, the authors have successfully employed the combined approach described by Marchal.\n [7] This technique involves localization of the stone in the ductal system by means of sialendoscopy. Exploration of the duct is guided by the illumination of the sialendoscope.\n\nIn submandibular cases, the exploration requires an intraoral incision. In parotid cases, a partial or complete parotidectomy incision and elevation of a superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap may be necessary to deliver the stone. This is followed by surgical repair of the duct and placement of a stent under endoscopic visualization.\n\nExpected Outcomes\nIn more than 900 sialendoscopy procedures performed in both parotid and submandibular cases, Marchal reported no instances of facial nerve paralysis or hemorrhage.\n [21] External surgery for the parotid gland is associated with a significant risk of facial nerve injury and submandibular gland extirpation associated with a risk to the hypoglossal, lingual, and marginal nerves; hence, endoscopic management is valuable and preferred when possible.\n [22] \n\nIn a retrospective analysis of 56 sialendoscopy cases, no instances of facial nerve paralysis or hemorrhage were reported.\n [10] Additionally, the authors found that major complications (defined as iatrogenic insults directly responsible for additional procedures) occurred in only 2% of cases and that minor complications (defined as any adverse event leading to either failure of the procedure, a second surgical procedure, a change in the surgical plan, or deviation from the planned course of events as a result of the procedure itself) occurred in 23%.\n\nWith respect to diagnostic sialendoscopy, Marchal and Dulguerov reported a 98% success rate in 450 cases,\n [1] whereas Nahlieli and Baruchin reported a success rate of 96% in their case series.\n [23] A study of 1,154 patients Zenk et al reported high stone and symptom-free success rates of 100% and 98% for sialendoscopy alone in submandibular and parotid cases, respectively. Additionally, long-term success was greater than 90% for patients with submandibular and parotid stones treated with sialendoscopy.\n [5] \n\nIn the interventional setting, Nahlieli et al reported success rates of 86% and 89% for endoscopic parotid and submandibular sialolithotomy, respectively, in 736 cases of sialolithiasis.\n [6] However, their success rate for endoscopic sialolithotomy was 80% in an earlier series representing 3 years’ experience, during which they reported a total of 32 cases of sialolithiasis with 4 failures.\n [24] \n\nNahlieli et al reported that 30-40% of stones could be managed by sialoendoscopy alone. Leurs et al reported that the greatest predictor of successful sialendoscopy was stone mobility. Stone size smaller than 5 mm resulted in an 80% removal rate, and stones smaller than 4 mm resulted in 91% removed.\n [19] \n\nIn a study of 175 patients with 191 stones in the submandibular gland who were treated by endoscopic retrieval or surgical release, 149 patients (85%) were rendered free of stones. Only 20 patients (11%) had residual stones and 6 patients (4%) went on to require excision of the gland.{re34}\n\nDelagnes et al showed symptomatic improvement in cases of salivary gland stenosis after sialendoscopy with dilation. Symptoms improved significantly for parotid glands by 16.6 points on a 20-item Chronic Obstructive Sialadenitis Symptoms (COSS) Questionnaire. For distal duct stenoses, significant symptom improvement was seen in cases treated with dilation only with a mean 20.6 point COSS reduction. They concluded that partial duct stenoses or distal duct stenoses are associated with the greatest improvements in COSS scores following sialendoscopy.\n [35] \n\nGland preservation is one of the major benefits of sialendoscopy. The gland preservation rate for large stones using a combined approach technique (endoscopy plus open or transoral techniques) has been reported as 86%.\n [22] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Sleep Endoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nSleep endoscopy, also known as sleep nasoendoscopy (SNE) or drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE), is a powerful tool for studying the dynamic airway in a sleeping patient with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Using the knowledge gained from sleep endoscopy, the surgeon can tailor the operative procedure to the patient's specific condition.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \n\n\nDue to the difficulty in establishing the site of obstruction in the conscious patient who carries a diagnosis of OSA, the diagnosis and treatment of OSA is a complex and multidimensional issue. Croft and Pringle first proposed sleep endoscopy in 1991. Using midazolam as a sedating agent, they demonstrated the utility of passing a fiberoptic endoscope (see the image below) through a sleeping patient’s nasal cavity to assess pharyngeal structures for evidence of obstruction. They were able to induce the preexisting snoring in 95% of their patients.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\nAdult fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope with 4-mm distal diameter, 2-way articulation, and video-recording capabilities. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1993, Croft and Pringle developed a grading scale that utilized sleep endoscopy to categorize snoring and obstruction. Grading was based on whether the obstruction was palatal, multilevel, or tongue-based.\n [6] Sleep endoscopy, in combination with the grading scale, allows the physician to directly observe pharyngeal structures in the sedated patient with OSA and categorize the obstruction.\n\n\n\n\nAnother grading system that uses sleep endoscopy to assess airway obstruction utilizes 3 separate evaluations of the pharynx. The first analysis uses a dichotomous assessment to identify individual areas of obstruction in the palate and hypopharynx regions. The second analysis assesses the percentage of obstruction in each area: less than 50%, 50-75%, and more than 75%, representing mild, moderate, and severe obstruction, respectively.\n\nBased on the level and pattern of airway obstruction in a patient with OSA, sleep endoscopy allows the physician to tailor the treatment plan to each patient. This can improve the results of surgical intervention and/or minimize the scope of intervention. Sleep endoscopy may also provide information that erases the need for surgery altogether.\n\nFor example, nearly 70% of patients surveyed in an outpatient setting by Hewitt et al were determined to have a palatal cause of obstruction and were prescribed surgical intervention. However, after the patients underwent sleep endoscopy, that figure dropped to 54%, reducing the number of procedures performed.\n [7] \n\nThe high success rate of customized treatment for OSA has been attributed to the targeted selection offered by sleep endoscopy.\n [8] The multimedia clip below shows typical findings seen on routine DISE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompilation of sleep endoscopy findings. Video courtesy of Philip E Zapanta, MD. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nOther techniques for OSA assessment\nOtolaryngologists use numerous modalities to locate the site of snore-sound generation and obstructive locations. These tools include a complete head-and-neck exam, the Müller maneuver, lateral radiographic cephalometry, computed tomography (CT) scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The static nature of these exams, coupled with increased resting muscle tone while the patient is awake, makes pinpointing the source of true obstruction difficult. While each of these methods offers reasonable diagnostic efficacy, none offers direct and dynamic visualization of pharyngeal structures during sleep.\n\nIndications and Contraindications\nAny patient who has documented OSA and is a potential candidate for OSA surgery should be considered for DISE via propofol.\n [9] This dynamic exam will study the patient’s real-time OSA under light sedation, complementing the complete head-and-neck exam and (utilizing the Müller maneuver) awake endoscopy.\n\nThe ideal patient should have:\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumented OSA\n\n\n\n\nAn airway deemed manageable by the anesthesiologist and the operating surgeon\n\n\n\n\nA patent nasal airway and nasopharynx, to allow the fiberoptic scope to pass unimpeded\n\n\n\nAbsolute contraindications include patients who are pregnant or who have a known history of propofol allergy. Other contraindications are significant nasal obstruction that impedes passage of the flexible fiberoptic laryngoscope (FFL), an “unsafe” airway, a frank aspiration history, and allergies to propofol components such as egg lecithin or soybean oil.\n\nOutcomes\nDue to the subjective nature of evaluating airway collapse during sedation, the question of sleep endoscopy’s reliability is a concern.\n\nWhen comparing assessments by 2 independent reviewers of prerecorded sleep endoscopy procedures, Kezirian et al demonstrated moderate to substantial interrater reliability. This was significant in the identification of primary structures involved in obstruction versus individual structures.\n [10] \n\nThis same study demonstrated a higher interrater reliability for assessment of the palatal region for obstruction in general versus assessment of individual structures that cause obstruction in the palatal region. The authors stated that the lower reliability in assessing individual structures is less important in palatal obstruction, because traditional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) treatment is the same regardless of the structure involved, be it the soft palate or velopharynx lateral pharyngeal wall.\n\n(However, there has been developing interest in UPPP modifications. These include the expansion pharyngoplasty,\n [11] uvulopalatal flap,\n [12] anterior palatoplasty,\n [13] and Z-palatopharyngoplasty.\n [14] Each of these modifies the palate in various ways, creating either a superior and lateral pull, an anterior pull, or a combination pull on the palate and pharynx. Application of these specific palate procedures based on DISE could change how the palate is addressed.)\n\nKezirian et al's study also mentions that the tongue, epiglottis and lateral pharyngeal walls are the 3 structures most commonly involved in obstruction in the hypopharynx. At this site, there is a moderate to substantial interrater reliability in assessing individual hypopharyngeal structures that cause obstruction. Because there are varying treatment options for the different structures that are involved, sleep endoscopy can help to determine which hypopharyngeal and oropharyngeal procedure will be the most efficacious.\n\nA study by Rodriguez-Bruno et al concluded that sleep endoscopy has good reliability, particularly in the evaluation of hypopharyngeal structures. The investigators looked at test-retest reliability, comparing the results from 2 distinct exams analyzed by 1 person.\n [15] \n\nWhen retrospectively reviewing more than 2,400 procedures involving patients with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, Kotecha et al demonstrated greater than 98 percent effectiveness of sleep endoscopy in producing snoring in patients. This conclusion was important, because in order for sleep endoscopy to be a valid tool for evaluating obstruction, it has to be proficient in recreating sleeplike conditions.\n [16] \n\nConcerns regarding the potential for false-positives with sedation revolve around the premise that sedation-induced sleep can cause a greater degree of muscle relaxation than physiologically natural sleep does.\n [17] Critics argue that snoring may be induced in the patient who otherwise would not exhibit symptoms during normal sleep.\n [18] \n\nHowever, when nonsnorers who underwent similar sedation techniques were compared with individuals with self-described snoring problems, the nonsnorers were not induced to snore with sedation.\n [19, 20] \n\nAnother concern with sleep endoscopy is whether or not the sedation-induced sleep alters the sleep profile. Rabelo et al showed that patients induced with propofol did not enter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during sedation and that these patients tended to remain in slow-wave sleep. When the apnea-hypopnea indexes (AHIs) between propofol-induced patients and those whom slept without sedation were compared, there was little difference between the groups. Although the fundamental sleep architecture is changed in a patient with OSA, propofol has been shown to not change the respiratory pattern in patients with apnea;\n [20] \n\nAnother study demonstrated a reduction in the duration of REM sleep in patients undergoing DISE; however non-REM sleep patterns were unchanged.\n [21] It is important to note that, although it is believed that the majority of apneic events occur during REM sleep, research has shown that AHIs measured during REM and non-REM sleep in patients with OSA do not differ significantly.\n [22] \n\nIntraprocedural grading using any of the methods described above typically correlates well with results of AHI, and it has been shown that AHIs measured after targeted therapy directed by sleep endoscopy are significantly lower.\n\nIn a study comparing 207 primary snorers without OSA with 117 subjects with OSA after receiving sedation, a higher degree of collapsibility was seen in the OSA group, with a correlation observed between the AHI during natural sleep and the degree of hypopharyngeal obstruction during sleep endoscopy.\n [23] \n\nIt is becoming more and more recognized that the utility of DISE easily surpasses the information gained from awake endoscopy in a clinic. A recent study concluded that DISE yielded better results as to specific sites, degree, and patterns of obstruction compared with the awake Muller maneuver.\n [24] \n\nComplications in sleep endoscopy\nComplications associated with sleep endoscopy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nEpistaxis from the flexible laryngoscope\n\n\n\n\nLaryngospasm\n\n\n\n\nAspiration\n\n\n\n\nLoss of the airway\n\n\n\n\nNeed for a surgical airway\n\n\n\nApplications of Sleep Endoscopy\nThe following are examples of various uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and hypopharyngeal modifications for select dynamic airway findings seen on DISE:\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral collapse of the oropharyngeal airway - Expansion sphincter palatopharyngoplasty (Tucker/Pang source)\n\n\n\n\nOropharyngeal anterior-to-posterior collapse - Uvulopalatal flap, anterior palatoplasty\n\n\n\n\nOropharyngeal concentric collapse - Combination of lateral and anterior-to-posterior collapse techniques, Z-palatopharyngoplasty\n\n\n\n\nHypopharyngeal base of tongue collapse - Submucosal minimally invasive lingual excision (SMILE), radiofrequency ablation of the base of tongue\n\n\n\n\nEpiglottic collapse - Hyoid suspension (this also helps with lateral hypopharyngeal collapse)\n\n\n\nSleep endoscopy is a great tool for teaching others about airway management, and it is helpful for anesthesiology and otolaryngology residents who are learning about airway anatomy and physiology.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe pharynx is bounded by the base of the skull superiorly; the cricoid cartilage inferiorly; and the nasal cavities, the oropharyngeal inlet, and the base of the tongue anteriorly.\n\nThe boundaries of the oropharynx are the lower edge of the soft palate superiorly and the hyoid bone inferiorly. The anterior border is formed by the oropharyngeal inlet and the base of the tongue, and the posterior border is formed by the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscles and their overlying mucosa.\n\nInferiorly, the posterior one third of the tongue, or the base of the tongue, continues the anterior border of the oropharynx. The vallecula, which is the space between the base of the tongue and the epiglottis, forms the inferior border of the oropharynx. This is typically at the level of the hyoid bone.\n\nThe borders of the hypopharynx are the hyoid bone superiorly and the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), or cricopharyngeus muscle, inferiorly.\n\nThe anterior boundary of the hypopharynx consists largely of the laryngeal inlet, which includes the epiglottis and the paired aryepiglottic folds and arytenoid cartilages. The posterior surface of the arytenoid cartilages and the posterior plate of the cricoid cartilage complete the anteroinferior border of the hypopharynx. Lateral to the arytenoid cartilages, the hypopharynx consists of the paired piriform sinuses, which are bounded laterally by the thyroid cartilage.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Throat Anatomy.

        "Speech Audiometry": "\nOverview\n\n\nSpeech audiometry has become a fundamental tool in hearing-loss assessment. In conjunction with pure-tone audiometry, it can aid in determining the degree and type of hearing loss.

        "Sphenoidotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nSphenoidotomy is the surgical opening of the sphenoid sinus.\nThe sphenoid sinuses are central aerations of the sphenoid bone that start developing at about 3 months’ gestation. Their development initiates as a vagination of the cartilaginous cupular process and continues to enlarge until the teenaged years.\n\n\nBecause of the high variability of sphenoid sinus pneumatization, the boundaries can differ from person to person.\nThe anterior boundaries of the sphenoid sinus are likely the most consistent. They include the sphenoid crest anterosuperiorly, which articulates with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, and the rostrum anteroinferiorly, which articulates with the vomer. The posterior boundaries of the sphenoid sinus usually include the sella turcica medially and cavernous sinuses laterally.\n\n\n\n\nHamberger described 3 types of pneumatization based on its relationship to the sella turcica: conchal (rudimentary or absent sphenoid sinus), presellar (a posterior sphenoid sinus wall that is separated from sella by thick bone), and sellar (a posterior sphenoid sinus wall that is adjacent to sella).\n [1] The most common configuration in his series was the sellar type, found in 86% of the population, compared to the presellar type (11%) and conchal type (3%).\n\n\n\n\nAuthors have described a quite common fourth configuration, postsellar type, in which sphenoid sinus extends beyond the sella turcica so that the sella forms a portion of the roof of the sphenoid sinus. In addition, the optic chiasm and internal carotid arteries are often intimately associated with posterior or lateral walls of sphenoid sinus.\n\nThe lateral limits of the sphenoid sinus vary greatly. The inferolateral area of the sphenoid sinus carries the vidian nerve, and the superolateral area carries V2 in foramen rotundum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronal computed tomographic image of the sphenoid sinus demonstrating the location of cranial nerve V2 and the vidian nerve. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe lateral extent of the sphenoid sinus may extend to or beyond these nerves.

        "Stapedectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nHistory of Procedure\nHearing loss due to stapes fixation was first described by Valsalva in 1704 in his volume on the human ear.\n [1] It is unknown when the first attempts at stapes surgery were performed, although Kessel is credited as being the founder of stapes surgery in the 1870s.\n\n\nEarly attempts at stapes mobilization were fraught with complications, including fatal labyrinthitis, and provided hearing gain for only days. These results prompted leading otologists in 1899 at the Sixth International Otology Congress to declare stapes surgery useless, dangerous, and unethical,\n [2] thus ending further work on stapes mobilization procedures.\nFollowing the turn of the 20th century, interest in surgery for stapes fixation was again reignited when Holmgren developed the fenestration procedure, in which a fenestra is created in the lateral semicircular canal, allowing sound to bypass the fixed stapes altogether. This was modified again by Sourdille in the 1930s, but it was Lempert who was credited with popularizing the fenestration procedure when, in 1938, he demonstrated a single-stage endaural fenestration procedure, which was quickly adopted as the procedure of choice for stapes ankylosis.\n\n\n\n\nThe current era of stapedectomy was started by Shea in the 1950s, when he created the first stapes prosthesis from Teflon. Various prostheses were then created during the following decade. The concept of stapes footplate surgery also changed, with various authors suggesting removing only portions of the footplate before placement of the prosthesis, and ultimately to the concept of the stapedotomy, in which a small hole is created in the fixated footplate for placement of the prosthesis. This allowed placement of the prosthesis piston into an appropriately sized hole and minimized the potential injury to the inner ear. Such techniques are still used today as the primary method of stapes surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Stroboscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nOver the past 3 decades, expanding knowledge of vocal fold anatomy and physiology has revolutionized the clinical and surgical practice of laryngology. Since Hirano's original description of the layered microstructure of the human vocal fold in the 1970s,\n [1] increasingly sophisticated diagnostic and surgical techniques have evolved to more precisely address and preserve vocal production. Innovative diagnostic modalities have grown out of an improved understanding of the critical importance of vocal-fold pliability to voice production. Videostroboscopy has evolved as the most practical and useful technique for the clinical evaluation of the visco-elastic properties of the phonatory mucosa.\n [2] \nVideo documentation of laryngeal anatomy along with its mechanical function is a painless, office-based procedure done with topical anesthesia and is essential for state-of-the-art management of human voice disorders. Videolaryngoscopy with stroboscopy is the essential diagnostic procedure for the evaluation of laryngeal mucosa, vocal fold motion biomechanics, and mucosal vibration.\n [3, 4] These are the key elements for detecting and assessing pathology as well as determining the impact on voice and airway function.\n\n\nStroboscopy is a special method used to visualize vocal fold vibration.\n [5] It uses a synchronized, flashing light passed through a flexible or rigid telescope. The flashes of light from the stroboscope are synchronized to the vocal fold vibration at a slightly slower speed, allowing the examiner to observe vocal fold vibration during sound production in what appears to be slow motion.\nThis slow motion picture is an illusion, as the speed of actual vocal fold vibration is not changed by stroboscopy. This special viewing allows the voice care team to evaluate each vocal fold's vibration properties during the different phases of the vocal fold's vibration cycle. Because vocal fold vibration is so fast, the slow motion view is actually derived from many successive vibration cycles. The information acquired from the stroboscopic examination of the vocal folds is essential for planning effective phonomicrosurgery (endoscopic surgery to enhance vocal function). Optimal human voice production is dependent on optimal vocal fold vibration. This requires aerodynamically competent closure of vocal folds along with pliable phonatory mucosa.\n\n\n\n\nVideostroboscopy fulfills several important requirements of a complete office voice examination. It provides useful, real-time information concerning the nature of vibration, an image to detect vocal pathology, and a permanent video record of the examination. As important as any of these aspects, stroboscopy substantially improves the sensitivity of subtle laryngeal diagnoses over techniques with continuous nonstroboscopic light sources (eg, rigid or flexible transnasal laryngoscopy).\n\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe vocal folds, also known as vocal cords, are located within the larynx (also colloquially known as the voice box) at the top of the trachea. They are open during inhalation and come together to close during swallowing and phonation. When closed, the vocal folds may vibrate and modulate the expelled airflow from the lungs to produce speech and singing. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Vocal Cord and Voice Box Anatomy and Larynx Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Substernal Goiter Surgery": "\nBackground\n\n\nEnlarged thyroid glands (ie, goiters) often extend in the mediastinum posterior to the sternum, making the gland, by definition, a substernal (or retrosternal) goiter.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] When this occurs, thyroidectomy surgery (excision of part or all of the thyroid gland) has unique considerations that are important to understand for the surgeon and patient.\nThis article reviews substernal goiter and focuses on substernal thyroidectomy.\n\n\nMost substernal goiters are composed of nontoxic multinodular thyroid glands, but can also represent a generalized enlargement of the thyroid gland, an enlargement of one particular nodule, or the inferior extension of thyroid carcinoma. Most (approximately 90%) substernal thyroid masses are benign goiters.\n [10, 11, 12, 6, 13, 14, 15] \nGoiters are often idiopathic in etiology but may be caused by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIodine deficiency (although increases in dietary iodine, particularly with iodinated salt, have dramatically reduced the frequency of goiters in the United States)\n [16] \n\n\n\n\nGoitrogens (foods such as cabbage, turnips, peanuts, and soybeans and drugs such as lithium, propylthiouracil, and amiodarone)\n [17, 18] \n\n\n\n\nHeredity\n [19, 20] \n\n\n\n\nMalignancy (with risk factors including radiation exposure, family history, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a [MEN 2a], and MEN 2b, among others)\n [21] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incidence of sporadic nontoxic goiter in the United States has been estimated to be approximately 5%. In some developing countries in which iodine deficiency is severe, up to one third of a population can be affected by goiters. Studies of chest radiographic screenings in Australia and the United States suggest substernal goiter may occur in approximately 0.02% of the population.\n [22, 23] In one study, mean age at diagnosis was 55.3 +/- 3.58 years, and most cases were found in women (83.3%).\n [70] Substernal thyroidectomy patients have been found more likely to be older, Hispanic or Black, and have Medicare insurance.\n [78] Reportedly, of patients undergoing thyroidectomy, up to 20% can have substernal goiters.\n [5, 24, 25, 26, 11, 27] The definition of a substernal goiter is currently not standardized, with great variability at which depth of thyroid extension beyond the thoracic inlet fulfills criteria.\n [71] \n\nSubsternal goiters can often remain asymptomatic for many years.\n [28, 29] Goiters are sometimes discovered incidentally during neck and chest radiography.\n [12, 7] However, the natural expectation of goiters is continued progressive growth, which may result in lower-neck discomfort, a noticeable neck mass, and progressive compression of the trachea, esophagus, and great vessels, thereby causing dyspnea, dysphagia/globus, and neck venous congestion/superior vena cava syndrome, respectively.\n [3, 26, 6, 30, 12, 70] \n\nSubsternal goiters are often more prominent on one side of the trachea and are thus highly correlated with tracheoesophageal deviation to the opposite side (see image below).\n [31, 3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChest radiograph of substernal goiter with tracheal deviation to the right. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIndependent of laterality, substernal goiters usually extend into the anterosuperior mediastinum. Unilateral extension is the most common finding with equal frequency between right and left-sided extensions.\n [77] With this type of extension, the recurrent laryngeal nerve is not usually displaced from the tracheoesophageal groove. Occasionally, substernal goiters may extend into the posterior mediastinum behind the trachea. Posterior mediastinal thyroid extension may displace the recurrent laryngeal nerve unexpectedly, further complicating surgical excision of the goiter.\n [14, 31] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Surgical Treatment of Meniere Disease": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nThe term endolymphatic hydrops refers to a condition of increased hydraulic pressure within the inner ear endolymphatic system. It is often used synonymously with the terms Ménière disease and Ménière syndrome.\n [1] However, Ménière disease is more correctly understood as endolymphatic hydrops without a determined etiology—that is, idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops—whereas Ménière syndrome can occur secondary to various processes interfering with normal production or resorption of endolymph.\n\n\nExcess pressure accumulation in the endolymph can cause a tetrad of symptoms: (1) fluctuating hearing loss, (2) occasional episodic vertigo (usually a spinning sensation, sometimes violent), (3) tinnitus or ringing in the ears (usually low-tone roaring), and (4) aural fullness (eg, pressure, discomfort, fullness sensation in the ears).\nAlthough the disease itself is not lethal, significant morbidity can arise from various manifestations of the disease. Vertigo can cause devastating accidents and falls. Hearing loss is often progressive over time. Many patients are unable to work and are forced to claim disability.\n\n\n\n\nSurgical management of Ménière disease is reserved for cases in which medical treatment fails. The future of Ménière treatment lies in the use of methods that are less invasive and less destructive than current ones to control vertigo. The concept of transtympanic delivery of medications is appealing. As new medications and delivery systems are discovered, more refined approaches to a cure may evolve.\n\n\n\n\nGo to Meniere Disease (Idiopathic Endolymphatic Hydrops) for complete information on this topic.\n\nIndications\nSurgery is indicated for Ménière disease that is refractory to medical management. Typically, failure to respond to 3-6 months of medical therapy is an indication for surgery. However, patients with severe debility may undergo surgery sooner. Any underlying medical causes of Ménière syndrome should be treated before surgical therapy is undertaken. The diseased ear must be clearly identified.\n\nContraindications\nPatients should be in good health and able to withstand surgery and anesthesia. Obtain a thorough history and perform a careful physical examination before the procedure to detect any medical contraindications. Surgery is not necessarily contraindicated in elderly patients. Patients in their 80s have tolerated labyrinthectomy fairly well.\n\nOtitis media and mastoiditis are contraindications for surgery. Resolve these infections before proceeding to avoid an increased risk of meningitis.\n\nBilateral vestibular disease is a relative contraindication for destructive procedures because of the risk of complete loss of inner ear function (ie, Dandy syndrome). Hypersensitivity or allergy to the target medication is a contraindication for aminoglycoside perfusion.\n\nOne principle of ear surgery is to avoid operating on an ear that provides all of the patient’s hearing because of the risk of creating profound bilateral deafness. This rule applies to most otologic surgical procedures.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe peripheral vestibular system is an integral part of the labyrinth that lies in the otic capsule in the petrous portion of the temporal bone.\n\nThe vestibular system, which is the system of balance, consists of 5 distinct end organs: 3 semicircular canals that are sensitive to angular accelerations (head rotations) and 2 otolith organs that are sensitive to linear (or straight-line) accelerations.\n\nThe labyrinthine cavity is essentially formed of the membranous labyrinth encased in the bony osseus labyrinth (see the image below). The osseus labyrinth is a series of bony cavities within the petrous temporal bone; the membranous labyrinth is the communicating membranous sacs and ducts housed within the osseus labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth is cushioned by the surrounding perilymph and contains the endolymph within its confines. The membranous labyrinth also has cochlear, vestibular, and semicircular components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInner ear: bony and membranous labyrinths. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Vestibular System Anatomy, Inner Ear Anatomy, Ear Anatomy, and Skull Base Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Surgical Treatment of Velopharyngeal Dysfunction": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA competent and dynamically functional velopharyngeal sphincter is essential for normal eating, normal breathing, and intelligible speech. The sphincter is positioned between the oral and nasal cavities and coordinates appropriate airflow through each chamber to allow a voice that has quality, richness, and carrying power. Closure of the velopharyngeal port prevents nasal regurgitation during eating and allows pronunciation of consonants, while opening of the port allows for normal respirations and specific nasal articulations. \n\n\nThe terms velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD), velopharyngeal incompetence, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), and velopharyngeal inadequacy are frequently used to denote an improperly functioning velopharynx. VPD includes any structural and/or neuromuscular disorder of the velum and/or pharyngeal walls at the level of the nasopharynx that results in interference of the normal sphincteric closure. It may result from anatomic, myoneural, behavioral, or a combination of disorders. (See Velopharyngeal Dysfunction.) \nBecause this article focuses primarily pharyngoplasty and pharyngeal flaps, the term “velopharyngeal dysfunction” is used to refer specifically to speech and resonance symptoms related to a known structural deficit that has been determined by perceptual and instrumental differential diagnosis. VPD is diagnosed clinically by a constellation of symptoms that includes pathologically incurred nasal resonance (hypernasality), compensatory misarticulations, escape of air through the nose (nasal emissions), and aberrant facial movements (grimacing). \n\n\n\n\nHypernasality is a quality perceived by the listener due to inappropriate nasal coupling, which refers to the balance of air traveling through the oral and nasal airways during speech. Errors in articulation of vowels and consonants occur from an inability to produce appropriate high intraoral pressure consonants, specifically, the stops, fricatives, and affricates. Tests such as the modified Müller maneuver cannot help distinguish patients with hypernasality. \n\n\n\n\nStop plosives (ie, p, b, t, d, k, and g as in “go”) are brief, purposeful interruptions of the airstream resulting in intraoral pressure buildup, with explosive release of that pressure buildup. Fricatives refer to sounds (s, z, sh, zh, f, v, and both voiced and voiceless th) produced by constricting the airstream through a narrow channel between the 2 speech articulators. Affricates (ch and g as in “George”) are high intraoral pressure consonants that begin as stops, but are released as fricatives. \n\nSeveral interventions are available for management of VPD, depending on the differential diagnosis and the cause of the pathology.\n\nGo to Velopharyngeal Dysfunction for complete information on this topic.\n\nIndications\nPatients with symptoms of VPD (eg, hypernasality, nasal emission, facial grimacing, compensatory misarticulations) are referred to a multidisciplinary velopharyngeal diagnostic center for video-recorded standard perceptual, nasoendoscopic, and fluoroscopic speech evaluations. The videos provide direct visualization of velopharyngeal closure for review by the interdisciplinary VPD team, and a consensus is reached for recommended management. \n\nCandidates for surgery fulfill the criterion of VPD dysfunction resulting from an anatomic, myoneural, or combined deficiency of the velopharyngeal sphincter that is not expected to be managed by speech therapy alone. \n\nContraindications\nTo stimulate collapse of the pharyngeal walls in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, have the patient perform a modified Müller maneuver. Instruct the patient to breathe rapidly with the mouth closed and the nose partially closed. Surgery to decrease the velopharyngeal port is contraindicated in these patients. \n\nVelopharyngeal-narrowing procedures are not appropriate for patients who meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patient declines surgical management by choice\n\n\n\n\nThe patient has a known or suspected risk for potential airway obstruction (patients with known obstructive sleep apnea or other upper airway compromise must be approached with caution with regard to performing posterior pharynx surgery; because of the possibility of triggering apneic episodes, pharyngeal flaps can be dangerous if performed in these patients; patients requiring surgical management who have risk factors for upper airway obstruction are preferentially recommended for sphincter pharyngoplasty on the basis of reports of its minimal effect on the airway) \n\n\n\n\nThe patient has intermittent or inconsistent closure that responds well to speech therapy\n\n\n\n\nThe patient has incomplete diagnostic results; with further studies and improvements in diagnostic technologies, speech production disorders should be more accurately assessed and individually managed to achieve optimal results \n\n\n\nIn addition, syndromic patients (ie, those with velocardiofacial syndrome [VCF syndrome]) may have anomalous carotid artery anatomy, which places these structures within the operative field of posterior pharynx surgery. However, in the view of some authors, visible pulsations on the posterior pharyngeal wall, indicating aberrant carotid arteries (see Anatomic Considerations), should not be considered an absolute contraindication to surgery.\n [1, 2, 3] \n\nA plethora of organizations provide humanitarian assistance to developing countries in which cleft care is not organized or coordinated. Most medical missions are undertaken on a short-term basis, which means that intermediate- and long-term outcome assessments are not performed. Because velopharyngeal-narrowing procedures have significant potential airway morbidity, arguably they should not be performed in the setting of a foreign medical mission. \n\nPathophysiology and Etiology\nCauses of VPD can be divided into 2 main categories as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural deficiency of the palate or its related musculature (eg, cleft palate)\n\n\n\n\nNeurologic deficiency (eg, myasthenia gravis, cerebrovascular accident, upper or lower motor neuron lesions, head trauma)\n\n\n\nPeterson-Falzone discusses noncleft causes of VPD, such as neuromuscular disorders, palatopharyngeal disproportion, and the effects of tonsils and adenoids.\n [4] The degree to which each component contributes to VPD is difficult to determine. \n\nAnatomically, VPD may also be divided into 2 categories as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor mobility of the soft palate secondary to various factors, including short palate, scarred/tightened palate, or dysfunction/malposition of the levator palatini muscle \n\n\n\n\nPoor mobility of the posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls due to poor muscular mobility\n\n\n\nThe latter is more commonly caused by a neurologic deficit.\n\nAnatomic Considerations \nSurgical treatment of VPD rests on an understanding of the anatomy of the velopharynx (ie, the palate, posterior pharyngeal wall, and airway; see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic lateral view of velopharynx, illustrating anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe soft palate marks the beginning of the oropharynx and is the movable posterior third of the palate. It forms an incomplete septum between the mouth and the pharynx. It is marked by a median raphe and is continuous with the roof of the mouth and the mucous membrane of the nasal floor (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard and soft palates. A: transverse rugae of hard palate; B: median raphe of hard palate; C: median raphe of soft palate. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe composite movements of the lateral pharyngeal walls, the velum, and the posterior pharyngeal walls close the velopharyngeal port in deglutition and during oral speech sounds; they open the port for breathing and some nasalized articulations. Patterns of closure as observed on preoperative instrumental assessments include coronal, sagittal, bow-tie, circular, and Passavant (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic bird's-eye view of velopharynx, illustrating directional movements of representative closure patterns. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe 3 muscles of the palate (levator veli palatini, tensor veli palatini, and uvularis) work in concert with the palatopharyngeus, the palatoglossus, and the pharyngeal constrictor muscles to produce VP closure. \n\nThe tensor veli palatini muscles arise from the membranous wall of the eustachian tube. Their tendons pass around the hamular processes of the medial pterygoid plate of the sphenoid and insert into the palatine aponeurosis. The levator veli palatini muscles also have their origin along the eustachian tube orifice. They meet in the midline in a sling-like fashion above and behind the aponeurosis. The uvularis is a small midline muscle sitting above and behind the levator sling. \n\nAn unimpaired velum moves posteriorly and superiorly, the posterior pharyngeal wall can move ventrally diffusely or as a well-defined shelf (known as the Passavant ridge), and the lateral pharyngeal walls move toward the midsagittal midline. The uvularis also contracts during speech, adding bulk to the area of convexity on the upper surface of the soft palate. The adenoids, residing in the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the pharyngeal tonsils, on the lateral pharyngeal walls, may augment or interfere with the function of those walls in velopharyngeal closure.\n [5] \n\nAs a person prepares to speak, the velum is partially raised and held at the ready position before speech begins; it then moves to the closed position as phonation starts. For nasal sounds (eg, “m, n”), the sphincter remains open. The ability of the sphincter to close is essential for compression of air behind the point of constriction so that consonants, especially plosives (eg, “f, s, th”) can release with sufficient strength. \n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Mouth Anatomy and Pharynx Anatomy.\n\nAberrant carotid arteries\nAnomalous internal carotid arteries have been shown to be a frequent feature of VCF syndrome. These vessels pose a potential risk for iatrogenic injury and hemorrhage during velopharyngeal-narrowing procedures. Various forms of cervical vascular imaging studies (eg, computed tomography [CT] scanning and angiography) have been advocated for defining the preoperative vascular anatomy so as to assist surgery. Whether these studies alter the conduct or outcome of operations on the velopharynx remains unclear. \n\nIatrogenic injuries to the carotid artery during velopharyngeal surgery are strikingly absent in the extant literature. Occasionally, transmission of vascular pulsations through floppy redundant mucosa may artificially masquerade as an ominous vessel. Additionally, tortuous mesially displaced vessels observed at one point have been shown to straighten out laterally on later studies. \n\nThe issue of how surgeons should approach the problem of aberrantly located carotid vessels is provocative and controversial and deserves overt answers from each participating surgeon; however, safety must prevail as the first priority. \n\nWhen displaced vessels are identified, surgeons are faced with 3 main options. First, the surgeon may simply abandon the procedure. Second, the surgeon may go ahead with the operation and “operate around” the displaced vessels. Third, the surgeon may choose to perform one procedure instead of another—for example, sphincter pharyngoplasty instead of pharyngeal flap. (Theoretically, performance of the latter procedure could expose a vessel over the full length of the flap.) \n\nSome authors are more comfortable operating in the presence of these aberrant structures, provided that the flap(s) can be repositioned so as not to interfere with the structures, expose the vessel to oropharyngeal secretions, or compromise the execution of the procedure. Preoperative vascular imaging studies need not be routinely obtained on all patients. Awareness of the presence of aberrantly located carotid vessels comes from careful inspection of the small operative field, palpation of aberrant vessels intraoperatively, and cautious surgery. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Temporal Artery Biopsy": "\nOverview\n\n\nTemporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis, is an inflammatory vasculopathy affecting medium- and large-sized arteries. While the superficial temporal branch of the carotid artery is particularly susceptible, arteries at any site can be affected. Temporal arteritis is defined by a granulomatous panarteritis with mononuclear cell infiltrates and giant cell formation within the vessel wall.\n [1] This unique histologic characteristic confirms the diagnosis of temporal arteritis in biopsy specimens of the temporal artery (TA).\nAlthough temporal artery biopsy has long been considered the gold standard for diagnosis of temporal arteritis, due to its 100% specificity, noninvasive diagnosis using imaging studies is gaining favor.\n [2]   For example, 2018 European guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis can be made without biopsy in cases where there is a high clinical suspicion and a positive imaging test.\n [3] \n\n\nThis article provides a method for consistent, safe, and cosmetically sensitive biopsy of the superficial temporal artery (Current Procedure Terminology [CPT] code 37609). The relevant anatomy, indications, and contraindications for this procedure are also reviewed. The video below includes an introduction to the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction by Dr. Andrew Winkler. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy\nThe superficial temporal artery is the smaller of 2 terminal branches of the external carotid. It begins behind the mandibular ramus in the substance of the parotid gland and courses superiorly over the posterior aspect of the zygoma. It can be consistently palpated in this region just anterior to the tragus. Approximately 5 cm above the zygoma, it divides into a frontal and parietal branch.\n\n\n\n\nAs it crosses the zygomatic process, it is covered by the auricularis anterior muscle, which can aid in identifying the vessel. The superficial temporal artery runs within the superficial temporal fascia, also known as the temporoparietal fascia. This is also the fascia within which the temporal branch of the facial nerve traverses. As the vessel travels superiorly, it is crossed at the level of the lobule by the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve, which are traveling medially. Safe dissection within the substance of the temporoparietal fascia is permitted because of the divergent course of the vessel from the facial nerve.\n\nWhile the superficial temporal artery crosses the posterior zygoma and continues posteriorly, the temporal branch of the facial nerve crosses the zygoma in the middle third and courses anteriorly to innervate the frontalis muscle.\n\nThroughout its course, the artery is accompanied by the auriculotemporal nerve, which lies immediately posterior to it, as well as the superficial temporal vein, which lies anterior to the artery. The superficial temporal artery may be safely ligated because of anastomoses with the supraorbital artery of the internal carotid artery, among others.

        "Thyroidectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe thyroid gland has been described throughout history but was first so named by the Romans for being a \"shield-shaped\" gland. Not only were thyroid masses mentioned in the literature throughout the 12th and 13th century, but in 1170 Robert Frugardi described the extirpation of a goiter. Thyroid surgery was undertaken well before thyroid gland physiology was understood. The procedures were often fraught with complications, including massive hemorrhage, infection, and injury to surrounding structures, all of which were associated with morbidity and mortality rates of nearly 40%.\n\n\nEven in the 19th century, thyroid surgery was considered barbaric, described by Samuel Gross as \"horrid butchery,\" and banned by the French medical society due to its high mortality. As technology improved and with the advent of aseptic technique, mortalities associated with these surgeries decreased.\n [1] During the 1850s, operations on the thyroid gland were undertaken via longitudinal, oblique, or vertical neck incisions. Jules Boeckel of Strasbourg introduced the collar incision to thyroid surgery in 1880, and this approach was popularized by Theodore Kocher. Theodor Kocher, whose own reported mortality rate for thyroidectomy dropped to 1%, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909 for his advancement of thyroid surgery in the late 19th century.\n [2, 3] \nThe surgical technique of thyroidectomy, as well as adjunct technology, continued to advance. Most recently, various new instruments (ie, harmonic technology) and approaches including video-assisted thyroidectomy and robot-assisted thyroidectomy have emerged. This chapter discusses the preoperative evaluation, intraoperative considerations, surgical technique(s), and postoperative concerns for patients undergoing thyroidectomy.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nVarious indications for thyroidectomy exist. One of the major indications is a diagnosis of thyroid cancer, usually biopsy-proven by fine-needle aspiration of a nodule.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the full range of thyroid nodule histology is beyond the scope of this chapter, the histology can have significant ramifications as to chosen operative management. In patients with all but the most minimal (low-risk) biopsy-proven papillary thyroid cancer, and all medullary thyroid cancer, a total thyroidectomy is indicated. Patients with a fine-needle aspiration showing either Hürthle cells or follicular neoplasm require at least a thyroid lobectomy of the side ipsilateral to the nodule and possibly a total thyroidectomy if the permanent operative specimen shows signs of malignancy. In addition to these malignancies, anaplastic thyroid cancer can occasionally be an indication for thyroidectomy, if no significant extension and infiltration into the surrounding structures is found.\n [4] \n\nBeyond malignancies, thyroidectomy is also a viable option for patients with symptomatic thyroid masses or goiters. Patients who have compressive symptoms including dysphagia, dyspnea, shortness of breath, and/or hoarseness due to a large goiter should undergo a thyroidectomy. Usually dysphagia to solids is the earliest presenting symptom. Aesthetic concerns due to a goiter may be an indication for thyroidectomy. Another indication includes patients with medically refractory Graves disease or hyperthyroidism.\n [5] \n\nContraindications\nUncontrolled severe hyperthyroidism (ie, Graves disease) is a relative contraindication to surgery due to concerns for intraoperative or postoperative thyroid storm. Although thyroidectomy can be performed during pregnancy for malignancy, many authors cite postponing surgery until after delivery if possible, secondary to risks to the fetus from the anesthesia. Indications for surgery during pregnancy include aggressive cancers or airway compromise. If elective thyroid surgery is undertaken during pregnancy, it should be performed during the second trimester if possible.\n [6, 7] \n\nAnatomy of the thyroid gland\nThe thyroid gland starts developing on approximately the 24th day of gestation from endodermal epithelial cells on the median surface of the pharyngeal floor—the foramen cecum. It develops caudal to the median tongue bud, which arises from the first pharyngeal arch, and rostral to the copula, which develops from the second pharyngeal pouch. By the seventh gestational week, the thyroid gland descends anterior to the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and cricoids cartilage to rest anterior to the trachea. The path of descent is marked by the thyroglossal duct, a tubular structure of thyroid tissue, that usually obliterates completely between the 7th and 10th gestational week. However, a persistence of the inferior-most aspect of this duct is present in as many as 50% of patients in the form of the pyramidal lobe.\n [8, 9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThyroid embryology. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe fully developed thyroid gland is composed of 2 lateral lobes and a central isthmus with or without a pyramidal lobe (40-50%). The thyroid lies in the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia and is attached from its superior-medial aspect to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages via the anterior suspensory ligament. Berry’s ligament (the posterior suspensory ligament) connects the posterior-medial aspect to the first and second tracheal ring and the cricoid cartilage. The sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles cover the thyroid gland anteriorly. The tubercle of Zuckerkandl extends off of the posterior and lateral aspect of the thyroid lobes.\n [8, 9] \n\nThe thyroid gland is a very vascular structure. The major arterial contributions are the superior thyroid artery, a branch off of the external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, which branches off of the thyrocervical trunk. Lastly, the thyroidea ima artery can provide an arterial supply through the inferior border of the isthmus in 2-12% of patients.\n [10] It branches from either the innominate, subclavian, right common carotid, internal mammary, or the aortic arch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThyroid anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins provide venous drainage and join either the internal jugular or innominate veins. The superior thyroid vein follows the pathway of the superior thyroid artery. The middle thyroid veins directly flow into the internal jugular vein. The inferior thyroid veins can be found just anterior to the trachea and often anastomose with each other. Lymphatic drainage tends to follow venous drainage and leads to the prelaryngeal, pretracheal, paratracheal, and supraclavicular nodes. The gland is innervated by the superior, middle, and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic trunk, as well as by parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve.\n [8, 9] \n\nAnatomy of the parathyroid glands\nThe parathyroid glands develop from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. The inferior parathyroid glands develop from the third pouch and descend at week 7 with the thymus to eventually rest at the dorsal surface of the thyroid gland outside of the thyroid capsule. The superior parathyroids develop from the fourth pouch and descend with the thyroid gland. The superior parathyroid glands are usually posterior to the inferior glands, and, as noted in the figure, they usually lie posterior to the plane of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\nAccessory parathyroid glands, as noted by Munck and Eisele, occur 3-7% and fewer than 4 glands are present in 3-6% of patients.\n [11] Gland descent is usually symmetric, and contralateral glands are usually located at the same level. Aberrant or ectopic glands can also be present if the glands descend incompletely or too far. Possible locations for parathyroid glands include the anterior or posterior mediastinum, carotid bifurcation, as well as the retroesophageal, retropharyngeal, or retrolaryngeal regions. The vascular supply for the parathyroid glands is usually from the inferior thyroid artery, although occasionally the superior glands are supplied by an anastomosis between the inferior and superior parathyroid arteries.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nParathyroid anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve\nThe recurrent laryngeal nerve branches off the vagus nerve and is present by the sixth gestational week, associated with the sixth branchial arch. Because the aortic arches are cranial to the larynx at this stage, the nerve does not loop at this point. As the larynx moves cephalad, the recurrent nerve also ascends. Although the distal portion of the sixth aortic arch degenerates on the right, it persists in the left as the ductus arteriosus. For this reason, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve stays below the ductus arteriosus and ascends to the larynx.\n\nOn the right, the nerve ascends with the larynx until it reaches the fourth aortic arch (the subclavian artery). In approximately 1% of the population, the right subclavian arises from posterior to the esophagus, allowing the right recurrent laryngeal nerve to ascend further and enter the larynx directly without forming a loop. Additionally, the loops of the recurrent laryngeal nerves can be reversed in patients with a right-sided aortic arch.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecurrent laryngeal nerve anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe left recurrent laryngeal nerve begins a course that is parallel and close to the tracheoesophageal groove at a more inferior position than the right nerve. The right nerve, on the other hand, angles toward the tracheoesophageal groove before running parallel to it. The middle portion of the recurrent nerve is often in close proximity to Berry's ligament, with some papers describing its course as penetrating through the ligament.\n [12] Both nerves follow the inferior thyroid artery, and, as it approaches the thyroid gland, they can be found either anterior to the artery, between branches of the artery, or posterior to the artery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBerry's ligament. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferior thyroid/recurrent laryngeal nerve relationship. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nOccasionally, the nerves branches prior to entering the thyroid gland into motor and sensory components. Additionally, a branch of the nerve ascends and anastomoses with the superior laryngeal nerve to form the Galen anastomosis.\n [9, 13] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Tracheoesophageal Puncture": "\nBackground\n\n\nPrior to the 1970s, rehabilitation of aphonia following a total laryngectomy (TL) was accomplished using esophageal speech or through the use of mechanical or electrical devices.\nEsophageal speech requires the patient to volitionally swallow air via the neopharynx and emit the air while articulating, as with normal speech. This produces a belchlike understandable speech.\n [1] Instead of using the vocal fold vibration as the sound source, this is replaced by the vibration of the pharyngeal walls. Many patients are able to teach themselves to speak to a degree in this manner, but fluency remains a challenge. Working with a speech pathologist can increase the fluency and clarity of their speech. The major advantage of this technique is the lack of any necessary prostheses or external devices.\n\n\nIn contrast, the mechanical larynx has been a mainstay in voice restoration. The early pneumatic devices were supplanted by electrical vibratory electrolarynges in the 1940s. Using these devices, speech is generated via an external vibration of the air column within the upper aerodigestive tract, combined with speech articulations, as in esophageal speech. The early learning period for this technique is short, and a reproducibly understandable voice can be quickly accomplished. The downsides to using an electrolarynx include an unnatural, mechanical, and often monotonal quality to the voice, as well as the necessity of a device itself. The device relies on battery power, may break, and may not be covered by the patient’s insurance.\nFirst described in 1980 by Singer and Blom,\n [2] tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) with prosthesis placement affords the clarity of esophageal speech without the volitional need to ingest and expel air. Their simple technique involves the surgical placement of a one-way valve between the tracheostoma and neopharynx, which allows air to be shunted on demand through the neopharynx and produce speech similar to esophageal speech. The one-way valve prevents retrograde flow from neopharynx to the trachea and prevents aspiration. Multiple advances have been made in prosthesis design and construction (including the advent of hands-free adjuvant devices), surgical technique, as well as in the timing of the procedure over the past 3 decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Transcutaneous Injection Laryngoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nGlottal incompetence is a condition of weakened voice production. The incompetence derives from loss of air through the vocal folds during phonation. Affected patients often report a weak breathy voice, decreased loudness, vocal fatigue, inability to produce an adequate cough, and shortness of breath while talking. Transcutaneous injection laryngoplasty is a treatment option that aims to improve glottal incompetence by moving one or both of a patient's vocal folds toward the midline, reducing the loss of air and thereby improving the symptoms. Augmentation material, which is a gel-like filler, is injected transcutaneously through the anterolateral neck directly into the vocal fold(s).\nTranscutaneous injection laryngoplasty is an office-based procedure that allows immediate reduction of symptoms. The procedure requires only local anesthesia with no need for an intravenous line or monitoring of vital signs. Two people are required to perform the procedure. An assistant passes the nasopharyngoscope through the patient's nasal passage and suspends it above the larynx so that the surgeon can view the inside of the throat. The surgeon then passes a needle connected to a syringe filled with augmentation material transcutaneously into the vocal fold. Injectate is then deposited into the vocal fold. See the Technique section below for more specific details.\n\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe vocal folds, also known as vocal cords, are located within the larynx (also colloquially known as the voice box) at the top of the trachea. They are open during inhalation and come together to close during swallowing and phonation. When closed, the vocal folds may vibrate and modulate the expelled airflow from the lungs to produce speech and singing. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Vocal Cord and Voice Box Anatomy and Larynx Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Transoral Parathyroidectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nParathyroid surgery was initially described in 1925 when Felix Mandl, a young surgeon in Vienna, was able to successfully remove a parathyroid tumor from a patient with osteitis fibrosa cystica.\n [1]  In the decades that followed, few significant technical changes occurred in parathyroid surgery; however, the procedure is now most commonly performed to treat primary hyperparathyroidism.\nTraditionally, the standard technique was four-gland exploration with removal of any abnormal or enlarged gland(s). As parathyroid imaging techniques advanced, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy became more commonplace and provided an equally high cure rate, a lower complication rate, a shorter hospital stay, and a large reduction in hospital costs.\n [2]  This approach uses a small anterior neck incision and targets a single parathyroid gland on the basis of imaging, as well as perioperative adjuncts (eg, gamma probe and intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay).  \n\n\nThe traditional surgical approach drastically changed in 1996 when Gagner\n [3]  described an endoscopic approach to subtotal parathyroidectomy with dissection in a subplatysmal plane, using four 5-mm trocars placed strategically in the neck. Despite a procedure duration of 5 hours and resultant subcutaneous emphysema, the door had been opened to investigate new approaches to an old surgical procedure.\nIn the following years, multiple minimally invasive procedures were developed—primarily for thyroidectomy—in an effort to avoid an anterior neck skin incision. Many procedures were described, including robotic\n [4, 5, 6, 7] and endoscopic\n [8, 9, 10, 11] approaches from the breast, axilla, or both breast and axilla; however, all necessitated varying degrees of tissue damage to obtain adequate access, as well as skin incisions elsewhere on the body.\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to avoid skin incisions entirely, Witzel et al first proposed the idea of a transoral thyroidectomy in 2008\n [12]  after successfully performing the procedure via a sublingual approach in living pigs and human cadavers.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Karakas et al\n [13] performed both hemithyroidectomies and parathyroidectomies in pigs and human cadavers. The following year, they published the first description of a transoral parathyroidectomy in two patients.\n [14]  Although the procedure was successful, one of the two patients suffered from perioperative dysphagia, tongue paresthesia, and hypoglossal nerve palsy, all of which resolved by the 6-week follow-up appointment.\n\nSubsequently, in 2014, the same group published a case series describing their experience with five transoral endoscopic parathyroidectomies.\n [15]  Two of the five patients required conversion to an open technique, three developed hematomas and dysphagia, one had persistent dysgeusia and transient hypoglossal nerve palsy, and one developed transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. The procedure was therefore deemed a feasible option but not a safe or viable one.\n [15] \n\nThe idea of endoscopic transoral parathyroidectomy was revisited in a 2016 article that described a transoral vestibular approach, which avoided the floor of the mouth and the associated complications.\n [16]  Sasanakietkul et al performed 12 parathyroidectomies via three incisions in the oral vestibule with promising results. In this series, there was one transient recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (symptom resolution within 1 month), no need for conversion to open surgery, and no other complications (eg, infection or neurovascular injury).\n\nThe conclusion that transoral parathyroidectomy is both a safe and a feasible surgical option was further supported by a subsequent series from Russell et al.\n [17]  Using a similar transoral vestibular approach, the authors performed 12 thyroidectomies and two parathyroidectomies using either an endoscopic or a robotic technique, with no surgical complications in either parathyroidectomy patient and no permanent complications in the thyroidectomy group.\n\nThe endoscopic versions of these procedures are sometimes referred to collectively as TOET/PVA (transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy/parathyroidectomy via the vestibular approach) or separately as TOETVA (transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy via the vestibular approach) and TOEPVA (transoral endoscopic parathyroidectomy via the vestibular approach).\n [18] \n\nAs of 2020, more than 2000 TOET/PVA procedures had been performed, including more than 400 in North America.\n [18] The current literature suggests that this approach is a safe and viable alternative for patients who are concerned about the aesthetics of an anterior neck incision.\n [19] Additional study (eg, of complications, expense, instrument limitations, and overall safety) is warranted.\n [20] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Turbinectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAs the primary controller of nasal airflow, the nasal turbinates, particularly the inferior turbinate, play an important role in normal nasal respiratory function. The mucosa of the turbinate is an essential tissue for proper respiratory function. Its roles include air humidification, air filtration, and the warming of inspired air.\n [1] Nasal obstruction due to enlarged inferior turbinates is a relatively common occurrence in otolaryngology, and when more conservative treatment fails (nasal steroids, allergic rhinitis treatment, etc), turbinate surgery may be indicated. Otolaryngologists use many different techniques to treat enlarged turbinates.\n [2] \nAlthough the nasal mucosa of the turbinates swells as part of the nasal cycle, outside agents such as infection, inhalant allergens, airborne irritants, and mucosal hyperreactivity can exacerbate the physiological swelling, necessitating a need for intervention.\n [3] Either the osseous or mucosal portion of the turbinate may be hypertrophic. For example, patients who present with allergic rhinitis generally have a swelling of the mucosa, while patients with a severe septal deviation may present with a unilateral enlargement of the bony component of the turbinate.\n [4] Knowing which portion of the turbinate is restricting airflow helps the surgeon determine which surgical techniques to use.\n\n\nVarious surgical techniques are available to reduce the size of the inferior turbinate. This includes turbinectomy, turbinoplasty, extramucosal or submucosal electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser-assisted resection or ablation, and cryosurgery.\n [5] Most surgeons’ goals are to preserve as much turbinate mucosa as possible while removing as much inferior turbinate bulk as possible. This allows normal turbinate mucosa physiology to continue.\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe lateral nasal walls contain 3 pairs each of small, thin, shell-like bones: the superior, middle, and inferior conchae, which form the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to these curved structures lies the medial wall of the maxillary sinus (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral nasal wall anatomy and paranasal sinus ostia. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nInferior to the turbinates lies a space called a meatus, with names that correspond to the above turbinate, eg, superior turbinate, superior meatus. The roof of the nose internally is formed by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. Posteroinferior to this structure, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nasal Anatomy.\n\nTurbinectomy\nTurbinectomy is a partial or complete resection of the inferior turbinate with or without the guidance of an endoscope. The microdebrider instrument is often used in this procedure in order to remove some of the soft tissue component, and the debrider can be used even in the more complex cases of bony hypertrophy.\n [6] The exposed raw mucosal edges and bone from this procedure may lead to nasal crusting with need for postoperative debridement. The mucosal edges may continue to bleed despite electrocautery control and nasal packing may be needed for hemostasis. Some evidence exists that turbinectomy may lead to a high incidence of empty nose syndrome.\n [7] However, the evidence is conflicting, and results seem to be quite operator dependent.\n\nTurbinoplasty\nTwo main techniques fall under the category of turbinoplasty. In the outfracture technique, an instrument is used to laterally reposition the turbinate and increase the patency of the airway. In the submucous resection technique, an incision is made at the head of the turbinate. A microdebrider and blunt dissectors are then used to remove some of the turbinate tissue. Subsequently, the mucosa is reapproximated and is allowed to heal over a smaller turbinate bone. Perforation of the mucosal flap or poor approximation of the incision can result in crusts, synechiae, and bleeding.\n [8] \n\nStudies comparing many different types of turbinate reduction have shown that after 6 years of follow up, submucosal resection showed the highest degree of nasal patency with restoration of mucociliary clearance and secretion of IgA. The study also showed that outfracturing of the inferior turbinate after the submucous resection of the turbinate improved the long-term results.\n [1] \n\nIn another interesting study, it was found that facial plastic surgeons who were trained in the general surgery—plastics residency format—tended to use the more traditional turbinate reduction techniques versus the newer, novel, more minimally invasive techniques. The most commonly used technique was inferior turbinate outfracturing.\n [9] \n\nRadiofrequency Ablation\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a very common thermal technique in which a thermal probe is physically inserted into the inferior turbinate and the delivered radioenergy removes some of the tissue. This technique has the advantage that it can be done in the office setting under local anesthesia and it has rare and minor complications.\n [10] Studies show that RFA has better outcomes than placebo surgery. Since the surgery is relatively noncomplex, it can be seen as an attractive option for people with minor inferior turbinate airway obstruction who are seeking a surgical option.\n [11] Patients tend to have recurrences with RFA, but since it is a clinic procedure, recurrences are easily treated in the clinic.\n\nRFA creates an ionization of submucosal tissue that subsequently leads to a scar that reduces the bulk of the surrounding tissue. Although fibrotic tissue replaces the glands and venous plexuses, nasal mucociliary function remains preserved.\n [12] The mucosal surfaces should not be involved.\n\nSeptoturbinotomy\nSeptoturbinotomy is a procedure typically performed with rhinoplasty. It is a minimally invasive procedure designed to expand the nasal vault by outfracturing the inferior turbinates and concurrently centralizing the vomer. This is performed by inserting a long nasal speculum along the nasal floor. It is aggressively opened to audibly outfracture the inferior turbinate bone and push the deviated vomer centrally. Alternatively, a large clamp can be used by opening it in a reverse “nutcracker” fashion. This technique has fewer complications (epistaxis, synechiae, and crusting) than traditional turbinate methods.\n [13] \n\nSummary\nInferior turbinate reduction for nasal obstructive symptoms caused by enlarged turbinates is a useful procedure. It is not a complex surgery and, depending on the patient’s needs, the procedure can be done in the clinic or operating room setting. Generally, turbinate reduction is a safe procedure with minimal morbidity issues. An otolaryngologist who knows several methods of turbinate reduction will be able to help most patients with significant nasal obstruction issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Tympanocentesis": "\nOverview\n\n\nTympanocentesis is a minor surgical procedure that refers to puncture of the tympanic membrane with a small-gauge needle in order to aspirate fluid from the middle ear cleft or to provide a route for administration of intratympanic medications. The procedure was described in 1768 and has been used since to treat acute otitis media (AOM).\n [1] It was particularly popular in the preantibiotic era, but its use has since declined. It is now used mainly for the management of complex cases that have not responded to antibiotic therapy,\n [2] as well as facilitating the delivery of medication directly to the middle and inner ear.\nRelevant anatomy\nThe primary functionality of the middle ear (tympanic cavity) is that of bony conduction of sound via transference of sound waves in the air collected by the auricle to the fluid of the inner ear. The middle ear inhabits the petrous portion of the temporal bone and is filled with air secondary to communication with the nasopharynx via the auditory (eustachian) tube.\n\n\nThe tympanic membrane (TM) is an oval, thin, semi-transparent membrane that separates the external and middle ear (tympanic cavity). The TM is divided into 2 parts: the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The manubrium of the malleus is firmly attached to the medial tympanic membrane; where the manubrium draws the TM medially, a concavity is formed. The apex of this concavity is called the umbo. The area of the TM superior to the umbo is termed the pars flaccida; the remainder of the TM is the pars tensa (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTympanic membrane (TM): pars flaccida (superior to insertion manubrium) and pars tensa (remainder of TM). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ear Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The success of the operation depends on the ability to eradicate disease from the middle ear (eg, inflamed granulation tissue and cholesteatoma). Various techniques have been developed and refined, and a number of grafting materials are available. Both the lateral and medial grafting techniques are detailed below.\nTympanoplasty is a safe and effective outpatient procedure used to both eradicate disease from the middle ear and restore hearing and middle ear function.\n [1, 2] A number of surgical approaches and grafting techniques are available for use by the surgeon.

        "Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nUvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is currently the most common surgery performed for adults with obstructive sleep apnea in the United States. The procedure increases the oropharyngeal airspace by resecting tissue in the throat, including one or more of the following: the uvula, soft palate, and tonsils.\n [1] \n\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep.\n [2] This results in cessations or significant reductions of airflow known as apneas and hypopneas, which ultimately lead to behavioral and cardiovascular morbidity.\n [3] It is estimated that 1 in 20 adults has obstructive sleep apnea with daytime impairment, but up to 5% remain undiagnosed.\nTracheotomy was the mainstay of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea until 1981, when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was introduced.\n [4, 5] Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and CPAP, are first-line treatment methods for obstructive sleep apnea. If these fail, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and other surgical treatment may be considered.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe soft palate marks the beginning of the oropharynx and it is the mobile posterior third of the palate. It forms an incomplete septum between the oral cavity and the pharynx. It is marked by a median raphe and is continuous with the roof of the mouth and the mucous membrane of the nasal floor (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard and soft palate anatomy.

The anterior aponeurotic portion is attached to the posterior border of the hard palate, and the posterior muscular portion hangs between the mouth and the pharynx and is termed the palatine velum (or velopharynx).\n\nThe velum is prolonged by a median free process termed the uvula and 2 bilateral processes termed the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches or pillars, which join the soft palate to the tongue and pharynx, respectively. The fauces represent the space between the oral cavity and the oropharynx. They are bounded superiorly by the soft palate, inferiorly by the root of the tongue, and laterally by the pillars of the fauces.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Mouth Anatomy, Throat Anatomy, Tonsil and Adenoid Anatomy, and Pharynx Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nIf a patient is unable to tolerate CPAP therapy, then surgery can be considered. General indications for surgical intervention include mild obstructive sleep apnea with excessive daytime fatigue, an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 or more, oxyhemoglobin desaturation less than 90%, and/or cardiac arrhythmias associated with obstructions.\n\nOutcomes\nInitially, the success rate of UPPP was reported to be less than 40%, with success defined as a reduction of respiratory disturbance index by 50% and an apnea-hypopnea index less than 10 or a respiratory disturbance index less than 20.\n [6] However, this low success rate was probably related to patient selection.\n\nThe Friedman staging system based on palate position, tonsil size, and body mass index was then established to aid with patient selection.\n [7, 8] Stage I patients had a palate size of 1 or 2 based on a modified Mallampati scale and tonsil size of 3 or 4 based on the Brodsky scoring system. These patients are the best candidates for surgery with a reported success rate of 80.6%. Stage II patients have a palate position and tonsil size of 3 or 4. Their success rate following uvulopalatopharyngoplasty was 37.9%. One meta-analysis found that Friedman stage I is a strong predictor for success after UPPP, while Friedman stage III and low hyoid position are negative predictors.\n [9] \n\nPatients with a body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2 were classified as stage III and had a success rate of only 8.1%.

        "Uvulopalatoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nUvulopalatoplasty a surgical procedure performed to reduce or eliminate snoring. Habitual loud snoring affects nearly a quarter of adult population. The carbon dioxide laser provides a convenient means for performing office-based uvulopalatoplasty for the treatment of snoring. With laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, a laser is used to remove part or all of the uvula.\n [1] Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty was developed and first performed in 1986 by Kamani (who used the term laser vaporization of the palatopharynx). Kamani reported that, after surgery, 85% of his patients had complete or near complete elimination of their snoring.\n [2, 3] \n\n\nCertain modifications have taken place since Kamani’s original procedure. Coleman\n [4] introduced the modified procedure in 1992 and called it laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty. In 1994, the most popular laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty technique was described by Krepsy and Keidar.\n [5] \nLaser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty is an office-based procedure performed under local anesthesia. It is a conservative approach to palatal shortening (avoiding velopharyngeal insufficiency) and patients generally experience less pain than with traditional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. However, one disadvantage of laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty is that the tonsils are not removed.

        "Vestibular Neurectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nComplete ablation of the peripheral vestibular apparatus or de-afferentation by sectioning of the vestibular nerve leads to total loss of function on one side, which can then be effectively compensated by central mechanisms. This aims to bring about a constant and long-lasting state of equilibrium that would not be possible if the vestibular input were fluctuating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Vestibuloocular Reflex Testing": "\nOverview\n\n\nA physician with bilateral, peripheral vestibular dysfunction described the classic example of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and its functional significance. The physician noticed that he was unable to read street signs while walking. However, if he stood still, objects became clear, and he was able to read again. This description of bilateral, vestibular dysfunction highlights the role of the vestibuloocular reflex in the stabilization of objects on the retina during brief head movements. When walking, vibrations from heel strike are transmitted to the head. A combination of the vestibuloocular reflex and the vestibulocollic reflex (VCR) stabilize visual acuity. Compensatory neck movements mediate the vestibulocollic reflex while head movements mediate the vestibuloocular reflex. Without the stabilizing effect of the vestibuloocular reflex, head perturbations as little as 2 Hz or 80° can result in retinal slip, which significantly alters visual acuity.\nSeparate studies by Jacobs and Carpenter show that visual acuity declines by 50% at a point 2° from the center of the fovea.\n [1, 2] The fovea (see the image below) is that part of the retina where photoreceptor density is greatest and visual acuity is highest. Thus, the main purpose of the vestibuloocular reflex is to maintain objects on the fovea, which thereby allows a person to visualize objects clearly during brief head movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic diagram of the human eye, with the fovea at the bottom. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nWhen the head moves, the vestibuloocular reflex responds with an eye movement that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (see the image below). Head movements, rotational and translational, stimulate the vestibuloocular reflex. With a rotational movement, the head moves relative to the body. Examples of this include turning the head back and forth, nodding, and bringing the ear in contact with the shoulder. Translational movements occur when the entire body (including the head) is moved in tandem. Translational movements may occur when an individual stands on a moving sidewalk. Thus, rotational vestibuloocular reflex (r-VOR) responds to angular motion of the head and results from stimulation of the semicircular canals, whereas translational vestibuloocular reflex (t-VOR) responds to linear motion of the head and results from stimulation of the otolithic organs. Some head movements may involve a combination of both translational vestibuloocular reflex and rotational vestibuloocular reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vestibulo-ocular reflex. A rotation of the head is detected, which triggers an inhibitory signal to the extraocular muscles on one side and an excitatory signal to the muscles on the other side. The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVestibuloocular reflex anatomy and physiology\nA simplistic view of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) involves a 3-neuron arc that consists of the vestibular ganglion, vestibular nuclei, and oculomotor nuclei. Although this arc provides a basic framework, the pathways involved in the generation of the vestibuloocular reflex are much more complex.\n\nRotational vestibuloocular reflex\n\nDuring rotational movements of the head, the endolymphatic fluid within the semicircular canals shifts because of its inertia, which deflects the cupula. Endolymphatic flow toward the ampulla is excitatory in the horizontal canals, while flow away from the ampulla is excitatory in the superior and posterior canals. Afferent nerves from the ampulla carry both excitatory and inhibitory signals to the 4 major vestibular nuclei: medial vestibular nucleus, lateral vestibular nucleus, inferior or descending vestibular nucleus, and superior vestibular nucleus. Different regions within each of the nuclei project to the oculomotor nuclei (cranial nerves III, IV, and VI). Efferent signals from these nuclei then result in contraction and relaxation of the appropriate ocular muscles.\n\nExcitation of the superior canal results in contraction of the ipsilateral superior rectus and contralateral inferior oblique muscles and relaxation of the ipsilateral inferior rectus and contralateral superior oblique muscles, which results in an upward torsional eye movement. Excitation of the posterior canal results in contraction of the ipsilateral superior oblique and contralateral inferior rectus muscles and relaxation of the ipsilateral inferior oblique and contralateral superior rectus muscles. This results in a downward torsional eye movement. Finally, excitation of the lateral canal results in contraction of the ipsilateral medial rectus and contralateral lateral rectus muscles and relaxation of the contralateral medial rectus and ipsilateral lateral rectus muscles. This results in a horizontal eye movement toward the opposite ear.\n\nThe vestibulocerebellum compares input from visual and vestibular sensors and mediates changes in the vestibuloocular reflex after vestibular injury or change in visual function.\n\nIn addition to oculomotor projections, the vestibular nuclei send fibers to the vestibulocerebellum, the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, and the cells within the paramedian tracts. The nucleus prepositus hypoglossi is crucial for the maintenance of a steady gaze, while the cells within the paramedian tracts are responsible for relaying information to the vestibulocerebellum, specifically the flocculus. Reciprocal projections to and from the cerebellum assist in fine motor control of eye movements. The latency of action of the rotational vestibuloocular reflex (r-VOR) is 7-15 milliseconds, which is the time required for the eyes to respond in an equal, but opposite, manner to the motion of the head. This time is remarkably fast compared with the latency for visually mediated eye movements, which is longer than 75 milliseconds.\n\nFinally, recent studies suggest that cerebral function may also be responsible for the modification of the vestibuloocular reflex and the ability to suppress the vestibuloocular reflex. Specifically, injuries to the parietal vestibular cortex and the ocular gyrus appear to interfere with visual suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex. In particular, the right temporoparietal cortex is believed to be involved in the modulation of the VOR. This region has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of sleep deprivation, particularly with respect to VOR gain during step testing.\n [3, 4] \n\nTranslational vestibuloocular reflex\n\nThe translational vestibuloocular reflex (t-VOR) pathways are activated in response to stimulation of the otolithic organs. The utricle responds to lateral translation stimuli, whereas the saccule responds to vertical translations. Translational vestibuloocular reflex pathways have not been studied as extensively as the pathways for the rotational vestibuloocular reflex.\n\nHowever, translational vestibuloocular reflex pathways also appear to be mediated by projections to the ocular motor nuclei via projections from the vestibular nuclei. Specifically, excitation of the utricular macula results in contraction of the ipsilateral superior oblique, superior rectus, and medial rectus muscles and relaxation of the contralateral inferior oblique, inferior rectus, and lateral rectus muscles.\n\nOther vestibular reflexes\n\nFinally, note that the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) is only one of 3 vestibular reflexes. The vestibulospinal and vestibulocollic reflexes also contribute to stability. The vestibulospinal reflex can be tested with the use of computerized dynamic posturography. The reader is referred to Medscape Reference articles Vestibular Rehabilitation and Inner Ear, Evaluation of Dizziness for additional information.\n\nOf the 3 vestibular reflexes, the vestibulocollic reflex is the least understood. The vestibulocollic reflex is indicative of otolithic (saccular) function and can be elicited by direct (intraoperative) stimulation of the inferior vestibular nerve, acoustic stimuli, mechanical stimulation of the forehead, and galvanic stimulation. The response can be measured as a myogenic potential in the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The test used, a vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test, continues to involve in its clinical application. For more information on VEMP testing, the reader is referred to Medscape Reference article Inner Ear, Evaluation of Dizziness.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Vestibular System Anatomy, Visual System Anatomy, Extraocular Muscle Actions, Extraocular Muscle Anatomy, and Inner Ear Anatomy.\n\nVestibuloocular reflex dysfunction\nSimilar to all other systems in the body, most individuals are not aware of the presence of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) until it malfunctions. Acute vestibuloocular reflex dysfunction may manifest in several different ways, depending on the anatomical location of the lesion or lesions, and may result from labyrinthine disorders or disorders of the central vestibular system.\n [5] See the table at the end of this section details.\n\nStudies have shown that patients with a unilateral peripheral vestibular lesion may exhibit asymmetric responses to rotation. On the other hand, patients with a compensated unilateral lesion show a characteristic pattern of decreased gain and increased phase lead at low-frequency stimulation.\n\nBilateral peripheral vestibular lesions are characterized by low gain and phase lag as determined by sinusoidal testing. These patients commonly report oscillopsia, a sensation of vertical or horizontal motion of the environment, or persistent unsteadiness, especially in the dark. Rotational chair testing is ideal in the assessment of these patients because, unlike caloric testing, higher frequencies are tested and both labyrinths are simultaneously stimulated. This allows for an accurate determination of remaining vestibular function, which is important for determining a course of treatment.\n [6] \n\nCentral vestibular deficits may also affect the vestibuloocular reflex. Thurston et al have shown that gains may be increased in some individuals with cerebellar deficits. Cerebellar atrophy, on the other hand, may result in a disorganized nystagmus pattern with beat-to-beat variabilities in the amplitude. As previously mentioned, lesions within the parietal vestibular cortex and the ocular gyrus may interfere with the ability to suppress vestibuloocular reflex visually.\n\nHigh-velocity angular vestibuloocular reflex function can also be affected by post-blast exposure, as studied in service members.\n [7] \n\nAlthough an impaired VOR is generally the result of an injury to the vestibular system, note that VOR may be affected by systemic disease processes such as migraines, depression, and anxiety disorders. With migraine vestibulopathy, one may see an elevated gain with visually enhanced VOR (VVOR), a testing paradigm where the VOR rotation stimulus is done in a lighted (ie, visually enhanced) environment rather than in the traditional dark booth. Patients who experience anxiety disorders may have an increased vestibular sensitivity resulting in significantly higher VOR gains and shorter time constants.\n [8] Finally, those patients with major depression have been shown to have hypoactive vestibular nuclei, resulting in a decrease in the slow phase of the nystagmus. All of these disorders should be screened for and considered when testing an individual with vestibular dysfunction.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

        "Videostroboscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nOver the past 3 decades, expanding knowledge of vocal fold anatomy and physiology has revolutionized the clinical and surgical practice of laryngology. Since Hirano's original description of the layered microstructure of the human vocal fold in the 1970s,\n [1] increasingly sophisticated diagnostic and surgical techniques have evolved to more precisely address and preserve vocal production. Innovative diagnostic modalities have grown out of an improved understanding of the critical importance of vocal-fold pliability to voice production. Videostroboscopy has evolved as the most practical and useful technique for the clinical evaluation of the visco-elastic properties of the phonatory mucosa.\n [2, 3, 4, 5] \n\n\nKey Considerations\nVideo documentation of laryngeal anatomy along with its mechanical function is a painless, office-based procedure done with topical anesthesia and is essential for state-of-the-art management of human voice disorders.\n\n\n\n\nStroboscopy is a special method used to visualize vocal fold vibration.\n [1] It uses a synchronized, flashing light passed through a flexible or rigid telescope. The flashes of light from the stroboscope are synchronized to the vocal fold vibration at a slightly slower speed, allowing the examiner to observe vocal fold vibration during sound production in what appears to be slow motion. The video below depicts videostroboscopic examination of the vocal folds of an adult male.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideostroboscopic examination of the vocal folds of an adult male. A strobe is used to visualize the mucosal waves across the vocal folds. The strobe is synchronized to the frequency of the voice. The mucosal waves are too fast for the human eye to appreciate. Therefore, the strobe slows this process by visualizing the mucosal wave across several cycles of vocalization. Notice that the mucosal waves originate upon contact or closure of the vocal folds and move from a medial to lateral direction. Additinoally, the mucosal folds are at the same position on both vocal folds at any particular time. Video courtesy of Ravindhra G Elluru, MD. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThis slow motion picture is an illusion, as the speed of actual vocal fold vibration is not changed by stroboscopy. This special viewing allows the voice care team to evaluate each vocal fold's vibration properties during the different phases of the vocal fold's vibration cycle. Because vocal fold vibration is so fast, the slow motion view is actually derived from many successive vibration cycles. The information acquired from the stroboscopic examination of the vocal folds is essential for planning effective phonomicrosurgery (endoscopic surgery to enhance vocal function)\n [6] . Optimal human voice production is dependent on optimal vocal fold vibration. This requires aerodynamically competent closure of vocal folds along with pliable phonatory mucosa.\n\nIndications\nVideolaryngoscopy with stroboscopy is the essential diagnostic procedure for the evaluation of laryngeal mucosa, vocal fold motion biomechanics, and mucosal vibration.\n [7] These are the key elements for detecting and assessing pathology as well as determining the impact on voice and airway function.\n [8] \n\nVideostroboscopy fulfills several important requirements of a complete office voice examination. It provides useful, real-time information concerning the nature of vibration, an image to detect vocal pathology, and a permanent video record of the examination. As important as any of these aspects, stroboscopy substantially improves the sensitivity of subtle laryngeal diagnoses over techniques with continuous nonstroboscopic light sources (eg, rigid or flexible transnasal laryngoscopy).\n\nContraindications\nThere are no absolute contraindications, but the patient needs to be able to open his mouth or have a patent nasal airway.\n\nAdditional Headings\nThe success of videostroboscopy depends upon patient comfort. Clear communication between the surgeon and patient before each step of the procedure is crucial to obtain adequate local anesthesia, to provide reassurance and to diminish anxiety. The ideal candidate has a patent nasal airway, minimal gag reflex with flexible/rigid laryngoscopy and is able to remain still, upright and poised in the exam chair throughout the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Vocal Cord Cordectomy": "\nPre-Procedure\n\n\nBackground\nCordectomy involves removal of the entire membranous vocal fold with the vocalis muscle. The inner perichondrium of the thyroid cartilage can be included and the arytenoids cartilage can also be removed, either partially or completely.\n [1] Cordectomy via thyrotomy is the oldest surgical procedure for the treatment of early glottic carcinoma.\n [2, 3] It remains the standard by which all other surgical treatments of small glottic cancers are measured.\n [1] \n\n\nCordectomy can be performed by the following 2 methods:\n\n\n\nCordectomy through laryngofissure\n\nEndoscopic laser cordectomy\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1908, Citelli introduced the so called cordectomy externa through thyrofissure.\n [4, 5] Chevalier Jackson described total cordectomy to treat patient with airway obstruction from bilateral vocal folds inability (1922) but the procedure was hampered by the resultant poor voice quality.\n [6] In 1932, Hoover published the results with similar approach through laryngofissure.\n [7] An important new concept was the submucosal dissection, which later became a standard. The preservation of the overlying mucosal allowed primary wound closure. Surjan further improved the concept of the submucosal approach through laryngeal fissure.\n [8, 5] Dennis and Kashima described posterior cordectomy for the treatment of bilateral vocal folds inability in 1989.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nImages depicting cordectomy can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram showing the incision line (blue dotted line) for right posterior cordectomy in cases of bilateral abductor paralysis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram showing the result of right posterior cordectomy in cases of bilateral abductor paralysis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe vocal folds, also known as vocal cords, are located within the larynx (also colloquially known as the voice box) at the top of the trachea. They are open during inhalation and come together to close during swallowing and phonation. When closed, the vocal folds may vibrate and modulate the expelled airflow from the lungs to produce speech and singing. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Vocal Cord and Voice Box Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nVocal cord cordectomy is indicated in the treatment of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDysplastic lesions of the vocal cords\n\n\n\n\nVocal cord malignancies- T1 lesions\n\n\n\n\nBilateral abductor paralysis\n\n\n\nContraindications\nCordectomy is contraindicated in the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the vocal cords' mobility is impaired.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the thyroid cartilage is invaded by the tumor.\n\n\n\n\nWhen supraglottic or subglottic extension exists.\n [1] \n\n\n\nEndoscopic laser surgery is contraindicated if general anesthesia is a threat to the patient’s life, such as in the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent infarct\n\n\n\n\nPatient with aneurysms\n\n\n\n\nBradycardia, etc\n\n\n\nBut, an increased risk is justified in patients with suspected malignancy.\n [11] \n\nEndoscopic laser surgery is not possible in patients with the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis\n\n\n\n\nFracture of cervical spine\n\n\n\n\nMandibular deformity\n\n\n\n\nPatients with short thick neck associated with marked prognathism.\n [11] \n\n\n\nTypes of Cordectomy\nCordectomy can be performed by the following 2 methods depending on the indication:\n\n\n\n\n\nEndoscopic laser cordectomy\n\n\n\n\nLaryngofissure with cordectomy\n\n\n\nA classification of laryngeal endoscopic cordectomies was first proposed by European laryngology society in 2000.The classification described 8 types of cordectomies, as follows:\n [12, 13] \n\n\n\n\n\nType I: Subepithelial cordectomy, which is the resection of vocal cord epithelium passing through the superficial layer of lamina propria .\n\n\n\n\nType II: Subligamental cordectomy, which is resection of epithelium, or Reinke’s space and vocal ligament.\n\n\n\n\nType III: Transmuscular cordectomy, which proceeds through vocalis muscle.\n\n\n\n\nType IV: Total cordectomy, which extends from vocal process to the anterior commissure.\n\n\n\n\nType Va: Extended cordectomy encompassing the contralateral vocal fold.\n\n\n\n\nType Vb: Extended cordectomy encompassing the arytenoids.\n\n\n\n\nType Vc: Extended cordectomy encompassing the ventricular fold.\n\n\n\n\nType Vd: Extended cordectomy encompassing the subglottis.\n\n\n\nThis classification did not propose any specific management for the lesions arising from the anterior commissure, which are being included among the indications for type Va cordectomy. To solve this problem, new cordectomy, encompassing the anterior commissure and anterior part of vocal cord, was proposed by European laryngology society working committee on nomenclature. This is classified as type VI.\n\nType VI is indicated for cancer originating in the anterior commissure involving one or both the vocal cords, without infiltrating the thyroid cartilage.\n [12] \n\nEuropean Laryngological Society classification allows one to define and clearly distinguish the extent of excision, which facilitates making meaningful comparisons between vocal outcomes after different types of cordectomy.\n\nPreparation\nAnesthesia\n\nAtropine is always included in premedication. Anesthesia is induced by intravenous injection of barbiturates or by application of gas mixture via a mask. Relaxation is usually achieved by a bolus of succinyl choline. A long term relaxant is preferred for cordectomy. The anesthetic usually consists of gas mixture such as halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen.\n [11] For more information, see general anesthesia.\n\nEquipment\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious laryngoscopes, including bivalve adjustable laryngoscopes are used to expose the larynx.\n\n\n\n\nTwo suction devices: one is mounted on to the operating microscope and the other suction is used by the surgeon to evacuate the plume and to manipulate the tissue.\n\n\n\n\nMicrolaryngeal surgery instruments\n\n\n\n\nCarbon dioxide laser coupled to an operating microscope\n\n\n\n\nLaser safe endotracheal tubes.\n [14] \n\n\n\nPositioning\n\nThe correct position is essential for the optimal introduction of laryngoscope.

        "Abdominal Examination": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nAlthough an essential component of all routine physical examinations, the physical examination of the abdomen is the key step in the evaluation of abdominal complaints such as pain, distension, enlarged organs, or masses.\n\n\nThe examination is conducted in a predetermined sequence starting from observation and then sequentially performing auscultation, palpation, and percussion (see images below) followed by ancillary maneuvers. However, a vital step in assuring a successful outcome is to properly prepare the challenging patient before anything else is done. For children, the parents should be present; if additional individuals are in the examining room, then the child must feel comfortable with their gender and their inclusion. The astute clinician must have specific goals in mind based on the history obtained. Like a musician or a dancer performing the same routine, the experienced caregiver can make subtle adjustments to yield the optimal result depending on the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdominal auscultation. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdominal palpation of a boy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercussion over the liver. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe most common reason for performing a focused examination is to identify the etiology of abdominal pain, which can be subdivided into visceral, somatoparietal, or referred. By definition, visceral pain cannot be specifically localized; however, accurate deductions can be drawn from a complete examination. Lower esophageal, gastric, and duodenal discomforts are best appreciated in the epigastric area. Signs of distal small bowel and/or colonic distension are usually expressed in the periumbilical region. Lower quadrant findings are typically secondary to pathology involving the ileocecum and appendix in the right and the rectosigmoid on the left. Somatoparietal findings correspond more exactly to the precise underlying abdominal contents.\n\nAlthough the abdominal examination has been a well described and fundamental component of a systematic diagnostic evaluation since antiquity, its role in modern medicine is being minimized. Unfortunately, most of the recent editions of standard textbooks of pediatrics, and of pediatric and adult gastroenterology do not emphasize this activity. The reader must instead consult textbooks devoted primarily to physical examination for additional descriptions of this process.\n [1] Cope’s classic treatise on the acute abdomen remains an excellent resource for a comprehensive explanation of performing the examination in adults and integrating it into patient care.\n [2] \n\nIn the United States, Western Europe, and most of the developed world, the role of the examination has been supplanted by high-resolution imaging techniques that are widely available. A cross-sectional study of 26 million pediatric emergency department visits revealed that, overall, the rate of advanced imaging increased from 6.4% of encounters in 2009 to 8.7% in 2018; specifically, the rate of computed tomography decreased from 3.9% to 2.9%, the rate of ultrasonography increased from 2.5% to 5.8%, and the rate of magnetic resonance imaging increased from 0.3% to 0.6%.\n [3] \n\nThe practice of greater reliance on radiographic findings has had many consequences. Patient outcomes become more dependent upon the technical quality of the study, which is dependent on the machine, the technician, and patient artifact, and the experience of the physician available to interpret the investigation during an emergency situation. This trend has also led to additional unnecessary radiation exposure as well as additional painful procedures (ranging from phlebotomy to invasive interventions) to characterize unanticipated abnormal radiographic findings and has also significantly contributed to the spiraling cost of health care in many countries.\n [4]  \n\nA large cross-sectional study has proposed a scoring system that would utilize a few standard screening laboratories in conjunction with a detailed physical examination to decrease the number of pediatric CT scans after blunt abdominal trauma.\n [5]  One publication highlighted that inadequacies in performing and interpreting the physical examination have contributed to medical error.\n [6] With the decreased utilization of routine abdominal examination in clinical medicine in the twenty-first century, there has been a decreased emphasis on teaching these skills. Paradoxically, the use of point-of-care ultrasounds has been introduced into medical schools to assist the teaching of physical examinations, particularly examinations of the cardiovascular system and the abdomen.\n [7] \n\nPerforming an abdominal examination in children is more challenging than in adults. A review article examining the published literature on diagnosing pediatric appendicitis failed to find a single study that documented that physical examination provided an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity to arrive at a correct diagnosis.\n [8] The cardinal finding of right-lower quadrant pain predicts appendicitis more accurately in adults than in children. However, the authors still concluded that \"clinical examination plays a key part in determining which children with abdominal pain should undergo immediate surgical consultation for appendectomy and which children should undergo further diagnostic evaluation, including diagnostic imaging.\"\n [8] \n\nIndications\nThe abdominal examination is part of all comprehensive examinations of all patients of all ages. These may be routine, scheduled examinations, or examinations to address nonspecific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, lethargy, loss of appetite, and nausea. It is an essential component of the evaluation of the patient with abdominal trauma (see images below), or generalized trauma which may include abdominal organs. It is the primary focus of the evaluation of a patient whose chief symptom is related to any type of abdominal signs or symptoms including, but not limited to, the terms listed above and to any suspected pathology in the gastrointestinal tract. If life-threatening intestinal pathology exists, most commonly obstruction, perforation, ischemia, or volvulus, a rapid and diagnostic abdominal examination will be the single most important factor to avoid mortality and to minimize morbidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdominal wall findings from a handlebar injury. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdominal wall findings in a passenger who was restrained with only a lap belt during a motor vehicle accident. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nContraindications\nNo contraindications exist to performing an abdominal examination. When significant pain exists, such as in the patient who is experiencing peritoneal irritation, ischemia of either the intestine or an abdominal organ (testes, ovary, spleen), or stretching of the capsule of the liver or kidney, the examiner should use a markedly gentler approach, which will be sufficient to elucidate the pathology. When splenomegaly exists, the examiner must exercise caution to avoid iatrogenic splenic injury.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe abdominal cavity is the largest hollow space in the body. It is bound cranially by the xiphoid process of the sternum and the costal cartilages of ribs 7-10; caudally, by the anterior ilium and the pubic bone of the pelvis; anteriorly, by the abdominal wall musculature; and posteriorly, by the L1-L5 vertebrae.\n\nThe anatomic planes of the abdominal wall are made up of multiple muscular and fascial layers that interdigitate and unite to form a sturdy, protective musculofascial layer that protects the visceral organs and provides strength and stability to the body's trunk.\n\nThe abdominal wall is composed of 5 paired muscles: 2 vertical muscles (the rectus abdominis and the pyramidalis) and 3 layered, flat muscles (the external abdominal oblique, the internal abdominal oblique, and the transversus abdominis muscles). These muscles and their fascial attachments interdigitate and unite to form a sturdy, protective musculofascial layer that gives strength and support to the anterolateral abdominal wall.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Regions and Planes of the Abdomen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Anal Sphincter Electromyography and Sphincter Function Profiles": "\nBackground\n\n\nAnal sphincter electromyography may be clinically useful in the evaluation of patients with urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. It should be considered for all patients with a history and clinical examination suggestive of a central or peripheral sacral neuropathic lesion. The external anal sphincter (EAS), innervated by the pudendal nerve, is the best muscle for detection of neuropathic lesions in lower sacral myotomes.\n [1, 2] Its circular superficial location and muscle bulk allows for easier access and less painful needle insertion in order to diagnose particularly proximal sacral nervous system disorders.\n [1, 3] \nSurface recordings from the sphincter have shown increased activity with body actions and decreased activity in sleep. Although surface EMG has been studied, needle EMG is clearly superior.\n [4] This article describes the clinical utility, commonly used technique, and role of EMG in various neurological disorders associated with anal sphincter abnormalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Blood Pressure Assessment": "\nOverview\n\n\nBlood pressure assessment is an integral part of clinical practice. Routinely, a patient’s blood pressure is obtained at every physical examination, including outpatient visits, at least daily when patients are hospitalized, and before most medical procedures. Blood pressure measurements are obtained for a wide variety of reasons, including screening for hypertension, assessing a person’s suitability for a sport (see the Medscape Reference topic Sports Physicals) or certain occupations, estimating cardiovascular risk (see the Medscape Reference topic Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease), and determining risk for various medical procedures.\nBlood pressure measurements are also obtained routinely when following a hypertensive patient to assist with tailoring of medications and treatment of hypertension. Finally, blood pressure measurements are crucial for identifying if a patient is in potential or actual clinical deterioration.\n\n\nTwo methods for measuring a blood pressure exist, the direct and indirect method. The direct method is the criterion standard and consists of using an intra-arterial catheter to obtain a measurement. It is used more commonly in the intensive care or operative settings. This method, however, is not practical due to its invasiveness and its inability to be applied to large groups of asymptomatic individuals for hypertension screening.\n [1] \nTherefore, the indirect (noninvasive) method is typically used. The indirect method involves collapsing the artery with an external cuff, providing an inexpensive and easily reproducible way to measure blood pressure. The indirect method can be performed using a manual cuff and sphygmomanometer, a manual cuff and doppler ultrasound, or with an automated oscillometric device. The manual method requires auscultation of the blood pressure, whereas the automated system depends on oscillometric devices.\n\n\n\n\nWith manual blood pressure measurements, both observer and methodological errors can occur. Observer errors include digit preferences, inattention, overly rapid cuff deflation, and hearing deficits, while methodological errors include not accounting for beat-to-beat variations in the pulses and sequential rather than simultaneous comparisons.\n [2] Automated oscillometric devices remove the observer errors that can occur with manual measurements but are not without faults. The inaccuracy of the oscillometric devices has been criticized, and some concern exists that using these devices in certain populations, such as hypotensive, hypertensive, trauma, or cardiac arrhythmia patients, can lead to inappropriate management.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nFor example, in one study, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater using a mercury manometer than automated oscillometric techniques.\n [4] These findings have important clinical implications, as the oscillometric techniques may falsely indicate that a patient treated for hypertension is now normotensive and requires no further medication adjustment. Regardless of these inaccuracies, automated oscillometric devices are used more frequently and appear to be sufficiently accurate for most clinical uses.\n [3] Furthermore, automated devices may give more accurate readings in the setting of patients with the syndrome of white-coat hypertension.\n [5] \n\nAnother key component of measuring a manual blood pressure is an understanding of the Korotkoff phases. The Korotkoff phases have been classified as 5 phases with phases I, IV, and V integral to obtaining an accurate blood pressure measurement. Descriptions of the 5 Korotkoff phases are outlined in the table below.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Of note, some believe that using the Korotkoff sounds instead of direct intra-arterial pressure typically gives lower systolic pressures, with one study finding a 25 mmHg difference between the 2 methods in some individuals.\n [6, 7] Furthermore, some disagreement exists as to whether Korotkoff phase IV or V correlates more accurately with the diastolic blood pressure. Typically, phase V is accepted as the diastolic pressure due to both the ease of identifying phase V and the lower discrepancy between intra-arterial pressure measurements and pressures obtained using phase V.\n [8] Phase IV, alternatively, is used to measure the diastolic pressure if a 10 mmHg or greater difference exists between the initiation of phase IV and phase V. This may occur in cases of high cardiac output or peripheral vasodilatation, children under 13 years old, or pregnant women.\n\nRegardless of whether a manual or automated method is used, the blood pressure measurement is a key part of clinical medicine. The following is a description of the indications, contraindications, and techniques for obtaining a blood pressure using both manual and automated devices.\n\nGuidelines\nRecommendations from the Canadian Hypertension Education Program include measurement of blood pressure using electronic (oscillometric) upper arm devices rather than auscultation for accurate office blood pressure measurement, and, in patients with increased mean blood pressure (but < 180/110 mm Hg) on visit 1, use of ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring before visit 2 to rule out white coat hypertension.\n [9] \n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over office-based monitoring as a better predictor of long-term cardiovascular outcomes.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Breast Cancer Screening": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nEarly detection remains the primary way to prevent the development of life-threatening breast cancer.

However, advances in imaging technology and disagreements over recommended schedules have complicated the issue of screening. As with any cancer screening program, careful consideration must be given to the risks of developing breast cancer as well as the benefits and harms of the screening intervention, along with the cost involved. Breast cancer screening guidelines provide different recommendations for women at average risk versus those with elevated risk; for full discussion of risk calculation, see Breast Cancer Risk Factors.\n\n\n\n\nEarly detection is widely endorsed by organizations that issue clinical recommendations for breast cancer care. Many expert groups have offered their recommendations for breast cancer screening, and much of the controversy lies in the fact that there is not a consensus about when to begin and end screening, how often to screen, and by what technique.

This has prompted governmental domestic preparedness training initiatives targeted at physicians and other healthcare providers in the areas of nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare.\nDecontamination is time consuming and requires resources. Nerve agents and substances causing injury to the skin and tissue are easily soluble in and penetrate many different types of material. If chemical warfare (CW) agents have penetrated sufficiently deep, then toxic gases can be released from the material for long periods. By adding substances that increase the viscosity of a CW agent, its persistence time and adhesive ability can be increased. These thickened agents will thus be more difficult to decontaminate with liquid decontaminants since they adhere to the material and are difficult to dissolve.\n\n\n\n\nThe need for decontamination can only be established by means of detection. If detection is not possible, then decontamination must be done solely on suspicion of contamination.\n\n\n\n\nThis article focuses on the initial approach to the chemical warfare victim.

        "Dermatologic Preoperative Evaluation and Management": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe preoperative consultation and evaluation is an important interaction between the patient and the physician. This process allows the surgeon to carefully assess the medical condition, evaluate the patient's overall health status, determine risk factors against the procedure, educate the patient, and discuss the procedure in detail. In return, the patient should gain a realistic understanding of the proposed surgery, consider alternative treatment options, and realize the possible complications during the perioperative period. The additional time invested in a preoperative evaluation yields an improved patient-physician relationship and reduces surgical complications.\nThe preoperative management of a patient with a surgical problem involves a diagnostic workup, a preoperative evaluation, and the preoperative preparation. The diagnostic workup determines the cause and the extent of the patient's condition. The preoperative evaluation is an overall assessment of the patient's health to identify operative risks that may influence the recovery period. This evaluation includes an anesthetic plan that take into consideration the patient's medical condition, the requirements of the surgical procedure, and the patient's preferences. A thorough assessment ensures that the patient's chronic diseases are under appropriate medical therapy prior to an elective procedure and establishes a rapport and confidence with the patient to allay fears and answer any questions. Finally, the preoperative preparation involves procedures that are implemented based on the nature of the expected operation and the findings of the diagnostic workup and preoperative evaluation.\n\n\nMany dermatologic surgical procedures are uncomplicated, and extensive patient evaluation is unnecessary. Some of these simple procedures include limited cryosurgery, curettage, electrosurgery, punch and saucerization biopsies, and simple excisions. However, the need for patient evaluation is greater with more complex procedures, such as dermabrasion, hair transplantation, flaps, and grafts. Certain underlying physiologic and pathophysiologic problems demand attention and caution. Medications and dietary supplements are often numerous and need to be scrutinized for their impact on anesthetic agents, hemostasis, and wound healing. With the appropriate preoperative evaluation and precautions, many dermatologic procedures may be safely performed.\nFor most nonmelanoma skin cancer, a pathologic diagnosis should be established by punch or shave biopsy. For small, low-risk nonmelanoma skin cancer of the head and neck, routine imaging is not usually performed. For larger ones, CT scanning may be the preferred imaging modality, as it allows reasonable evaluation of the extent of ostial involvement (eg, temporal bone, zygoma, maxilla, mandible, orbit), as well as nodal basins. MRI may be used as an adjunct to CT scanning if clinical suspicion for perineural invasion is elevated. Positron-emission tomography scanning generally is not used preoperatively, but rather used to assess the progression of metastatic disease and response to systemic therapy. However, in selected cases, it may be used to assess the extent of regional disease prior to treatment.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nPreoperative ultrasound-guided incisional biopsy may enhance the pathologic accuracy of cutaneous melanoma diagnosis.\n [2] Sentinel lymph node mapping by single photon emission computed tomography (PET-CT)/CT in early-stage malignant head and neck skin tumors may be desirable.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nThe goals of this article are to present guidelines for performing a complete preoperative evaluation and to highlight specific issues and management problems that arise in patients undergoing dermatologic surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Diagnostic Allergy Testing": "\nOverview\n\n\nDiagnostic allergy testing should be considered when a clinical scenario suggests an external, usually harmless, substance is causing pathology.\nThe term “allergy” indicates an abnormally hypersensitive immune reaction. Allergic conditions have a significant impact on health and health care. Allergies are the 6th leading cause of chronic illness in the US with an annual cost in excess of $18 billion. More than 50 million Americans suffer from allergies each year.\n [1] The pathophysiology of allergy in many other otolaryngologic, pulmonary, and dermatologic disorders has yet to be fully understood.\n\n\nExamples of allergic triggers include aeroallergens, medications, food, insect stings, and chemicals (occupational exposure). Conditions may vary from chronic illnesses such as allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma to acute anaphylaxis from venom or medication.\nDiagnostic allergy testing should be performed in the context of a history that suggests an allergic trigger. A positive test alone is not sufficient to diagnose an allergic condition. Positive allergy tests demonstrate sensitization but do not always indicate clinical reactivity. There may also be some scenarios in which the allergic condition is clear and further evaluation is not needed, such as seasonal pollen-induced allergic rhinitis controlled with cetirizine.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to diagnose the allergic trigger when avoidance can minimize or prevent the allergic reaction. Pharmacologic treatment may vary depending on whether there is an allergic versus nonallergic trigger, such as rhinitis.\n\n\n\n\nType I immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy testing is evaluated by measuring allergen-specific IgE. This can be done through skin testing (in vivo) testing or with serological tests (in vitro). Another option is a direct challenge. End-organ provocation of the nasal mucosa, bronchial mucosa, or conjunctivae is less commonly used in current clinical practice.\n\nFood and medication challenges are more commonly performed because of the rate of high false-positive sensitization for food and need for medications. Any challenge should be performed in a medically supervised setting with treatment for anaphylaxis readily available.\n\nType IV delayed-type hypersensitivity allergy is assessed through patch testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Neurodiagnostics (NDS), electromyography (EMG), and evoked potentials (EPs) are aspects of electrodiagnosis.\nInformation needed to answer any questions regarding nerve injury, muscle injury, muscle disease, localization, and prognosis can be obtained through electrodiagnostic testing. This information should help to focus treatment on the exact site of injury.\n\n\nInterestingly, the information provided by electrodiagnosis is functional and not static, telling the practitioner how the nerve and muscle are functioning. In contrast, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study is a static test that simply provides a picture of anatomy. A relatively benign appearing MRI scan can be obtained from a patient with significant pain. Conversely, MRI scans reveal disk protrusions and herniations in many people who are asymptomatic. Therefore, electrodiagnostic testing can be an important adjunct in diagnosis.\n [1, 2, 3] \nVarious specialists perform electrodiagnostic studies. Understanding and performing electrodiagnostic tests is a requirement in the specialty training of physical medicine and rehabilitation (physiatry) residents and is considered an elective in the training of neurology and anesthesia residents.\n\n\n\n\nThe American Board of Electrodiagnostics was developed to provide additional certification for physicians who perform electrodiagnostic tests, and this certification is considered the criterion standard for specialty training.

        "Four-Point Restraint": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nFour-point restraints may be required for patients with psychiatric illnesses or altered mental status who become violent and dangerous in the emergency department. The use of physical restraints may be necessary for their own protection and the protection of others. Professionals must understand the indications and contraindications for the use of physical restraints. Knowing the proper application of physical restraints is crucial for minimizing the risk of harm to the patient and the treatment team.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \n\n\nAgitation and violent behavior are frequently seen in acute care settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient psychiatric facilities.\n [5, 6, 7] Approximately 10% of psychiatric patients in the emergency department will have violent behavior and possibly require some form of restraint.\n [8] Studies show that nurses and mental health workers are at an increased risk of work-related violence.\n [9, 10] Psychiatry residents have a 40–50% chance of being physically assaulted by a patient during their residency,\n [11] and emergency physicians also have an increased risk of being physically assaulted by a patient at some point during their practice.\n [12] Physical restraints are therefore a necessary safety measure in certain circumstances.\nProfessionals must be aware of the potential negative physical and psychological consequences of restraints. Measures should be taken to preserve the patient’s dignity and rights. The act of physically restraining a patient has both ethical and medicolegal implications, including the potential violation of a patient’s rights.\n [13] One study that compares legal and medical opinions suggests that emergency physicians are inclined to use restraints more frequenctly than juris doctors given the same scenario.\n [14] Therefore, the use of four-point restraints should be a last resort after attempts to deescalate the situation have failed and less restrictive measures were ineffective.\n [15] The decision to physically restrain a patient must be given serious consideration.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nFor the patient's own protection and the protection of others, a health care professional may deem it necessary to place a patient in four-point restraints. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services established some basic principles for the use of restraints (see C.F.R. 482.13).\n\n\n\n\nRestraint and seclusion can only be used in emergency situations if needed to ensure physical safety and if less restrictive interventions have been determined to be ineffective. There is a degree of ambiguity concerning what situations constitute a true emergency and physicians must sound clinical judgment and carefully document their reasoning.\n [16] In addition, the patient has the right to be free from restraint and seclusion, in any form, imposed as a means of coercion, discipline, or retaliation by staff. Restraints should not be used for convenience.\n [17, 18] \n\nKeeping these principles in mind, there are certain indications that may prompt the use of four-point restraints:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the patient is physically combative\n\n\n\n\nWhen the patient is a clear and immediate danger to self or others\n\n\n\n\nWhen less restrictive alternatives have been attempted without success\n\n\n\n\nWhen it reasonably appears that delay in restraint would subject the patient and others to risk of serious harm\n\n\n\nAttempts at deescalation that should be considered before the use of four-point restraints include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nVerbally requesting cooperation while maintaining a nonaggressive posture and tone of voice\n\n\n\n\nHaving an adequate security force nearby that is visible to the patient\n\n\n\n\nRedirecting and/or diverting the patient's emotions\n\n\n\n\nSeparating the patient from others\n\n\n\n\nOffering appropriate medications\n\n\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to four-point restraints include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the patient is competent and refusing care\n\n\n\n\nWhen the patient is not a danger to self or others\n\n\n\n\nWhen less restrictive alternatives have not been considered or attempted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Gait Analysis After Amputation": "\nOverview\n\n\nAmputation is one of the most emotionally upsetting and traumatic events that a patient can undergo. However, with a team approach by the medical staff, the negative effects can be minimized and the positive benefits emphasized. Equipping the patient with a prosthesis not only greatly improves the patient's functional status but also helps his or her psyche.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \nPeople who have undergone amputations often adapt a unique way of ambulating with a prosthesis, but these adaptations also bring about challenges in diagnosing problems with their gait. By understanding the biomechanics of the patient's gait, most problems can be discerned by means of observation.\n [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] \n\n\nFrequency\nApproximately 70,000 new major amputations are performed annually in the United States. Worldwide, 200-500 million major amputations are performed each year.\n\n\n\n\nMajor limb amputations of the lower extremities account for approximately 85% of all cases of amputations, and more than two thirds of these are due to vascular and infectious complications. Although people with diabetes make up about only 2-5% of the general population, they account for 40-45% of all patients who undergo amputations because of their propensity for peripheral vascular disease. The risk of amputation is correlated with a susceptibility to diabetes.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nThe image below depicts various levels of lower-extremity amputations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe various levels of lower-extremity amputations. \n\n\nAmputations occur on the right side and the left side in equal proportion.\n\nEtiology\nAmputations might be required for several reasons. Peripheral vascular disease predominates and is seen in about 65% of cases. It often occurs with diabetes. Patients with this disease are usually aged 60-75 years. Amputations due to trauma occur in 25% of all cases; most of these patients are aged 17-55 years.\n\nIn the pediatric age group, trauma causes about 75% of acquired amputations, usually from accidents with power tools such as lawnmowers. Malignancy with or without other disease is the third most common cause, leading to about 5% of amputations. Cancers such as osteogenic sarcoma are involved in about 25% of acquired amputations in those aged 10-20 years.\n\nCongenital limb deficiency results in as many as 5% of all amputations, and 60% of the cases involve children. Congenital cases outnumber acquired cases by a ratio of 2:1 in the pediatric age group.\n\nRecent studies\nSu et al studied prosthetic ankle motion (Endolite Multiflex Ankles [flexion unit] and Otto Bock Torsion Adapters [torsion unit]) in 19 patients with bilateral transtibial amputations.\n [12, 13] According to study findings, the flexion unit increased ankle sagittal plane motion (6-7º) and increased positive ankle power (about 0.17 W/kg), and the torsion unit increased transverse plane ankle range of motion by 1-2º. Patients' responses to questionnaires indicated that 14 of the 19 patients preferred the prosthetic configuration that included both the flexion and torsion units. The authors also noted that the patients felt that the increased prosthetic ankle motion improved stability on uneven terrain.\n [12, 14] \n\nWolf et al measured socket pressure in 12 patients with unilateral transtibial amputations using a microprocessor-controlled adaptive prosthetic ankle\n [15] (Proprio-Foot [Ossur]). Highest peak pressures of 2.4 k Pa/kg were found for incline ascent at the calf muscle, as compared to 2.1 k Pa/kg for level walking, with large interindividual variance. In stair ascent, a strong correlation was found between maximum knee moment and socket pressure. The most significant pressure changes relative to level walking were seen in ramp descent anteriorly toward the stump end, with pressure time integral values being almost twice as high as those for level walking. According to the authors, adapting the angle of the prosthesis on stairs and ramps changed the pressure data to those closer for level walking.\n [16] Hordacre et al found that increased corticomotor excitability can have a negative impact on function.\n [17] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Gestational Diabetes Testing Protocol": "\nBackground\n\n\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, affects 2-10% pregnancies in the United States.\n [1, 2] Women with gestational diabetes have a 35-60% chance of developing diabetes mellitus over 10-20 years after pregnancy.\n [1] \nSee Clinical Findings in Diabetes Mellitus, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify various cutaneous, ophthalmologic, vascular, and neurologic manifestations of DM.\n\n\nHyperglycemia in pregnancy results in both maternal and fetal complications. Maternal complications consist of hypertension, preeclampsia, increased risk of cesarean delivery, and development of diabetes mellitus after pregnancy. Fetal complications include macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, polycythemia, increased perinatal mortality, congenital malformation, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress syndrome, and hypocalcaemia. Long-term consequences of macrosomia include increased risk of glucose intolerance, diabetes, and obesity in childhood.\n [3, 4, 5] \nThe Western diet of high fat, high carbohydrate, and high sodium foods is a significant contributor to excessive weight gain during pregnancy and, thus, a risk factor for developing diabetes. Other risk factors, which should be assessed at the first prenatal visit, include obesity, age greater than 25 years, prior history of gestational diabetes, first-degree relative with diabetes, history of poor obstetrical outcome, and certain ethnic groups.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nWomen with underlying insulin resistance are at risk for developing GDM. This progression to GDM is thought to be due to physiologic changes of late pregnancy. In pregnancy, human placental lactogen, which is structurally similar to growth hormone, and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha induce changes in the insulin receptor and in post-receptor signaling. Changes in the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor, decreased phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase on the insulin receptor, and alterations in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and the intracytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) appear to be involved in reducing glucose uptake in skeletal muscle tissue.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study in Pregnant Women (ACHOIS) was a large randomized control trial that investigated the role of screening and treatment of gestational diabetes in reducing perinatal complications, improving maternal outcomes, and affecting quality of life.\n [8] This trial of 1000 participants showed a composite reduction in serious perinatal morbidity and mortality (death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, and nerve palsy) in the intervention group compared to the conventional group. Also, a decrease in prevalence in macrosomia in the intervention group infants and reduced rate of gestational hypertension in the intervention group was found.\n [8] \n\nAnother large, multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in the United States recruited women with mild gestational diabetes mellitus. One group received treatment consisting of dietary changes, self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin if needed and the other received the usual prenatal care. Outcomes with respect to perinatal and obstetrical outcomes were compared.\n [9] This trial of 19,665 participants used slightly different parameters to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus but had similar outcomes. There was a significant reduction in macrosomia with the treatment group as well as reduction in rates of Cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension and weight gain.\n\nFinally, the HAPO trial (Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes), which included over 23,000 pregnant women, sought to clarify risks of adverse outcomes associated with various degrees of maternal glucose intolerance less severe than overt diabetes mellitus.\n [10] The study results showed positive linear correlations between increasing levels of fasting, 1-hour and 2-hour plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), and macrosomia and cord-blood C-peptide levels above the 90th percentile. Weaker associations were noted between glucose levels and cesarean delivery and neonatal hypoglycemia. The secondary outcomes of premature delivery, shoulder dystocia, hyperbilirubinemia, and preeclampsia were also noted to increase in incidence with higher levels of post OGTT glucose levels.\n [10] \n\nThe HAPO trial showed that maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes increased significantly with maternal hyperglycemia even at lower threshold ranges than prior diagnostic criteria for GDM. This prompted the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy study groups (IADPSG), whose committee consists of members from US and International diabetes organizations, including American Diabetes Association (ADA), and obstetrical organizations, to revise recommendations for diagnosing GDM. Whereas previously in the 2005 Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus screening was based on risk stratification, now the IADPSG along with the ADA recommend that all women with no prior history of diabetes undergo 75-g Glucola oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation.\n [11, 12] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "History and Mental Status Examination": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe history and Mental Status Examination (MSE) are the most important diagnostic tools a psychiatrist has to obtain information to make an accurate diagnosis. Although these important tools have been standardized in their own right, they remain primarily subjective measures that begin the moment the patient enters the office.\nPinel stated \"To seize the true character of mental derangement in a given case, and to pronounce an infallible prognosis of the event, is often a task of particular delicacy, and requires the united exertion of great discernment, of extensive knowledge and of incorruptible integrity.\" This exemplifies the importance of the mental status examination to the practice of psychiatry. The clinician must pay close attention to the patient's presentation, including personal appearance, social interaction with office staff and others in the waiting area, and whether the patient is accompanied by someone (ie, to help determine if the patient has social support). These first few observations can provide important information about the patient that may not otherwise be revealed through interviewing or one-on-one conversation.\n [1] \n\n\nWhen a patient enters the office, pay close attention to their personal grooming. One should always note things as obvious as hygiene, but, on a deeper level, also note things such as whether the patient is dressed appropriately according to the season. For example, note whether the patient has come to the clinic in the summer, with 3 layers of clothing and a jacket. These types of observations are important and may offer insight into the patient's illness. Other behaviors to note may include a patient talking to themselves in the waiting area or perhaps pacing outside the office door. Record all observations.\nThe next step for the interviewer is to establish adequate rapport with the patient by introducing himself or herself. Speak directly to the patient during this introduction, and pay attention to whether the patient is maintaining eye contact. Mental notes such as these may aid in guiding the interview later. If a patient appears uneasy as they enter the office, attempt to ease the situation by offering small talk or even a cup of water. Many people feel more at ease if they can have something in their hands. This reflects an image of genuine concern to the patient and may make the interview process much more relaxing for them.\n\n\n\n\nLegally, a mental status conducted against the patient's will is considered assault with battery. Therefore, it is important to secure the patient's permission or to document that a mental status is being done without the patient's approval in an emergency situation.\n\n\n\n\nThe time it takes to complete the initial interview may vary; however, with experience, interviewers develop their own comfortable pace and should not feel rushed to complete the interview in any time that is less than comfortable for either the interviewer or the patient. All patients require their own time during this initial interview and should never be made to feel they are being timed.\n\nBeginning with open-ended questions is desirable in order to put the patient further at ease and to observe the patient's stream of thought (content) and thought process. Begin with questions such as \"What brings you here today?\" or \"Tell me about yourself.\" These types of questions elicit responses that provide the basis of the interview. Keep in mind throughout the interview to look for nonverbal cues from patients. As they speak, for example, note if they are avoiding eye contact, acting nervous, playing with their hair, or tapping their foot repeatedly. In addition to the patient's responses to questions, all of these observations should be noted during the interview process.\n\nAs the interview progresses, more specific or close-ended questions can be asked in order to obtain specific information needed to complete the interview. For example, if the patient is reporting feelings of depression, but only states \"I'm just depressed,\" determining both the duration and frequency of these depressive episodes is important. Ask leading questions such as \"How long have you had these feelings?\" or \"When did these feelings begin?\" and \"How often do you feel this way?\" or \"How many days in the past week have you felt this way?\" These types of questions help patients understand what information is needed from them. For safety reasons, both the patient and the interviewer should have access to the door in case of an emergency during the interview process.\n\nAt some point during the initial interview, a detailed patient history should be taken. Every component of the patient history is crucial to the treatment and care of the patient it identifies. The patient history should begin with identifying patient data and the patient's chief complaint or reason for coming to the clinic. The patient's chief complaint should be a quote recorded just as it was spoken, in quotation marks, in the patient's record. This also is where all history of illness is recorded, including psychiatric history, medical history, surgical history, and medications and allergies. Of interest, it is important to make direct inquiry to items such a family history of members being murdered—patients often do not volunteer this information.\n\nAdditionally, listing any family history of illness is important. This information can be very useful later, when determining treatment options. If a family member has a history of the same illness and had a successful drug regimen, that regimen may prove to be a viable option for the current patient. If possible, record the medications and dosages family members took for their illnesses. If these medications and dosages worked for family members, the chance is good that they may work for the current patient.\n\nObtain a complete social history. This addition to the patient history can be most crucial when discharge planning begins. Inquire if the patient has a home. Also ask if the patient has a family, and, if so, if the patient maintains contact with them. This also is the area in which any history of drug and alcohol abuse, legal problems, and history of abuse should be recorded.\n\nImperative to the recording of a patient's social history is any information that may aid the physician or other clinicians in making special accommodations for the patient when necessary. This would include an accurate record of the last grade completed in school, whether the patient was in special education classes, or if the patient required special assistance at work or school (ie, special listening devices for the hard of hearing).\n\nFollowing completion of the patient's history, perform the MSE in order to test specific areas of the patient's spheres of consciousness. To begin the MSE, once again evaluate the patient's appearance. Document if eye contact has been maintained throughout the interview and how the patient's attitude has been toward the interviewer. Next, in order to describe the mood aspect of the examination, ask patients how they feel. Normally, this is a one-word response, such as \"good\" or \"sad.\"\n\nNext, the interviewer's task is to define the patient's affect, which will range from expansive (fully animated) to flat (no variation). The patient's speech then is evaluated. Note if the patient is speaking at a fast pace or is talking very quietly, almost in a whisper. Thought process and content are evaluated next, including any hallucinations or delusions, obsessions or compulsions, phobias, and suicidal or homicidal ideation or intent.\n\nThe images below depict suicide statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThen, the patient's sensorium and cognition are examined, most commonly using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The interviewer should ask patients if they know the current date and their current location to determine their level of orientation. Patients' concentration is tested by spelling the word \"world\" forward and backward. In the case of a less educated or capable patient, a clinician may alternatively ask a patient to recite the months of the year backwards or forwards. Reading and writing are evaluated, as is visuospatial ability. To examine patients' abstract thought process, have them identify similarities between 2 objects and give the meaning of proverbs, such as \"Don't cry over spilled milk.\" Once this is completed, perform the physical examination and needed laboratory tests to help exclude medical causes of presenting symptoms.\n\nIn recent years, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has also been used to assess patient sensorium and cognition. A 2015 review found that the MoCA had comparable diagnostic performance to the MMSE in assessing mild cognitive impairment.\n [2, 3] \n\nA compilation of all information gathered throughout the interview and MSE leads to the differential diagnosis of the patient. Once this diagnosis is established, a treatment plan is formulated. At this point, involving the treatment team (eg, social workers, nurses, others) is important to help carefully explain to patients what their treatment will entail. Be sure to ask patients if they have any questions regarding their treatment plans. Discuss the details of the medications chosen, including adverse effects. Give details of the hospital stay if patients are to receive inpatient treatment, such as estimated length of stay, visiting hours, and other aspects. Inform patients that even though the interviewer is the treating physician, their input and concerns are valuable and necessary in order to fulfill treatment goals.\n\nEvery patient interview affords the health care professional an invaluable opportunity to provide patient education. While different illnesses may require specialized attention, this time can be used to discuss such patient issues as medication compliance, nutrition, the importance of follow-up appointments with primary care physicians and other specialists (eg, obstetricians, gynecologists, neurologists), the urgency of seeking emergency medical help at the emergency department when necessary, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, and general education concerning the patient's illness. Never overlook providing needed education to patients.\n\nThe process of conducting an accurate history and MSE takes practice and patience, but it is very important in order to evaluate and treat patients effectively. This part of psychiatry is so important that it comprises part II of the Board Certification Test. The history and MSE are crucial first steps in the assessment and are essential tools psychiatrists have to select treatment for each patient. Frequently, the MSE is the deciding factor for initial treatments. This fact alone should make the interviewer cognizant of the essential role the history and MSE play each time a patient is evaluated.\n [4, 5] \n\nOnce the history and MSE are complete, documenting this event accurately and efficiently is important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Of those, approximately 15% were unaware of their diagnosis. Approximately 39,000 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2015--differences within subpopulations illustrated in below—with a 5% decline in new diagnoses from 2011 to 2015.\n [3, 4] \nEarly diagnosis of HIV infection is of paramount importance, allowing health care providers an invaluable opportunity to prevent further transmission of the disease and to begin therapy, if warranted. Studies have also shown that infected persons who are aware of their positive HIV status decrease behaviors associated with transmission of the disease.\n [5, 6]  Furthermore, studies have also shown treatment of HIV infection can significantly lower the risk of transmission to sexual partners. The identification of persons living with HIV and their subsequent treatments is a cornerstone of the US strategy to prevent HIV infections; this strategy begins with testing.\n [7]  The diagnosis of HIV infection, as with any other diseases, should include a complete history and a detailed physical examination in order to reach an accurate interpretation of the information provided by laboratory data.\n\n\nThis article provides an overview of the available testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection.

        "Knee Examination": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA clinical knee examination is the first step to be performed for patients with complaints of the knee, after taking a thorough patient history. An examination of the knee can differentiate pathologies and often provides information necessary for the definitive diagnosis.\n [1, 2] \n\n\nThe knee examination should be performed in a standardized manner. The examination starts with inspection, followed by active and passive mobilization and isometric muscle testing. Finally, palpation and specific tests should be performed. The tenderest point of the knee should be examined last to prevent a guarding reaction from the patient due to pain.\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe knee is composed of 4 bones: the femur, tibia, fibula and patella. All these bones are functional in the knee joint, except for the fibula. The femur is the longest and strongest bone in the human body. The proximal end forms the head of the femur, which projects anterosuperomedially to articulate with the acetabulum. The distal end is wider and forms a double condyle that articulates with the tibia and patella. The tibia articulates with the distal lateral and medial femoral condyles. The patella articulates anteriorly to the femoral condyles in the region of the intercondylar fossa (trochlear groove).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ligaments of the knee joint can be divided into the extracapsular ligaments and intra-articular ligaments. The extracapsular ligaments or external ligaments are the patellar ligament, medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCLs), oblique popliteal ligament, and arcuate popliteal ligament. The intra-articular ligaments are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the posterior meniscofemoral ligament. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnee joint, anterior view. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Knee Joint Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Metabolic Cart": "\nBackground\n\n\nCritical illness can significantly affect metabolism, so an accurate measurement of the resting energy expenditure (REE) can help determine the energy requirements in ICU patients. REE (usually 70% of the total energy expenditure) can increase after burns, sepsis, trauma, and surgery. A precise calculation of energy expenditure may prevent overfeeding or underfeeding.\nREE can be measured with indirect calorimetry using a metabolic cart, which is used to measure the oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). Every liter of oxygen consumed is equivalent to the energy cost of 5 kcal. A metabolic cart can also be used to assess the energy requirements during exercise and to determine work capacity.\n\n\nIn 1949, Weir introduced an equation to facilitate the calculation of REE, as follows:\nREE = [VO2 (3.941) + VCO2 (1.11)] 1440 min/day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

A thorough neurologic history allows the clinician to define the patient's problem and, along with the result of physical examination, assists in formulating an etiologic and/or pathologic diagnosis in most cases.\n [1, 2] \nSolid knowledge of the basic principles of the various disease processes is essential for obtaining a good history.

An infant or child’s deviation from a previously stable growth pattern is often the first sign of an underlying issue that requires close follow-up. Pediatricians need to be aware of risk factors for failure to thrive and obesity and the potential morbidity and mortality associated with these issues for the child.

        "Pap Smear": "\nOverview\n\n\nWorldwide, approximately 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 274,000 deaths are attributable to cervical cancer yearly, making cervical cancer the second most common cause of death from cancer in women.\n [1] Fortunately, the incidence of cervical cancer has decreased by more than 50% in the past 30+ years, largely due to the increasing use of cervical cancer screening with cervical cytology.\n [2] \nThe American Cancer Society estimates about 13,240 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed and about 4170 women will die from cervical cancer in 2018.\n [3] Although worldwide cervical cancer rates have decreased dramatically with the increase in screening efforts, incidence and prevalence in developing countries remains high due to lack of screening programs, with approximately 80% of all cervical cancer deaths occurring in the developing world.\n [1] \n\n\nThe mainstay of cervical cancer screening for the last 60+ years has been the Papanicolaou test. The Papanicolaou test, also known as the Pap test or the Pap smear, was developed in the 1940s by Georgios Papanikolaou. It involves exfoliating cells from the transformation zone of the cervix to enable examination of these cells microscopically for detection of cancerous or precancerous lesions.\nAn image depicting a Pap smear can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPap smear. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the technique known as liquid-based cytology, these collected cells are released into a vial of liquid preservative that is then used in the cytology lab to produce a slide for microscopic evaluation of the cells. The older, traditional Pap technique involves direct transfer of the cervical cells to a microscope slide for evaluation. Although the traditional method may introduce confounders such as blood and other debris to the slide, which may make interpretation more difficult, both conventional cytology and liquid-based cytology have been shown to have similar sensitivity and specificity for moderate dysplasia or worse lesions when using a threshold of LSIL or higher. In addition, both types of cytological screening are considered acceptable by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n [2] \n\nWhen abnormal cells are detected on the Pap Test, diagnostic testing in the form of colposcopy is often indicated. This testing may be followed by diagnosis of dysplasia via colposcopic biopsies. Subsequent cervical cancer may be prevented through the diagnosis and treatment of these cervical cancer precursors.\n\nEvidence shows that approximately 99-100% of cervical cancers are attributable to infection by high-risk types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV represents a family of double-stranded, circular DNA viruses that can infect skin or mucosal cells, including the anogenital region and the oral cavity, and may be transmitted easily via sexual intercourse or direct contact.\n [4, 5] \n\nMore than 100 types of HPV exist, 12 of which can involve the anogenital region and are considered \"high risk\" or oncogenic in nature. These include HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59. Of these, HPV 16 is responsible for the largest number of CIN 3 and cervical cancer cases, and HPV 16 and 18 combined are thought to be responsible for nearly 70% of all cases of cervical cancer.\n [4] Although HPV is a necessary factor in the development of cervical dysplasia that can eventually lead to cervical cancer, most women infected with HPV will not develop cervical dysplasia.\n [6] The presence of high-risk HPV DNA is accompanied by cytologic abnormalities approximately one third of the time. Whether an HPV infection will progress relates to the persistence of the infection and also possibly to the immune response and smoking status of the woman.\n [7] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe female reproductive organs can be subdivided into the internal and external genitalia. The internal genitalia are those organs that are within the true pelvis. These include the vagina, uterus, cervix, uterine tubes (oviducts or fallopian tubes), and ovaries. The external genitalia lie outside the true pelvis. These include the perineum, mons pubis, clitoris, urethral (urinary) meatus, labia majora and minora, vestibule, greater vestibular (Bartholin) glands, Skene glands, and periurethral area.\n\nThe cervix is the inferior portion of the uterus, separating the body of the uterus from the vagina. The cervix is cylindrical in shape, with an endocervical canal located in the midline, allowing passage of semen into the uterus. The external opening into the vagina is termed the external os, and the internal opening into the endometrial cavity is termed the internal os. The internal os is the portion of a female cervix that dilates to allow delivery of the fetus during labor. The average length of the cervix is 3-5 cm.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Female Reproductive Organ Anatomy.

        "Pelvic Examination": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe pelvic examination encompasses an examination of the vulva, vagina, and internal pelvic organs. Females typically undergo their first pelvic examination for the evaluation of gynecological complaints or at age 21 years, whichever comes first. Pelvic examinations were once performed for cervical cytology or screening for gonorrhea or chlamydia before age 21 years. However, the availability of urine testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia has reduced the necessity of routine pelvic examination before age 21 years.\nThe examination is a basic tool of physical diagnosis and can be performed by either physicians or trained allied health professionals. Few studies have addressed patient preference concerning pelvic examinations alone, but about 45% of women reported that they would prefer a female doctor for their gynecologic care, 4.2% reported that they would prefer a male doctor, and the remaining women expressed no preference. Many women anticipate that the nurse assisting the physician will give them additional information about the pelvic examination.\n [1] \n\n\nSince the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines changed the frequency of cervical cancer screening based on age and risk factors, many experts have begun to doubt the need for routine pelvic examination. An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)–commissioned report found no evidence that these examinations led to earlier detection of ovarian cancer.\n [2] In addition, no evidence has shown the benefits of a pelvic examination in the early diagnosis of other conditions in asymptomatic women.\n [2] Speculum and bimanual examinations are uncomfortable and disliked by many women and take up valuable time during a well-woman visit.\nAnnual pelvic examinations are often equated with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, but they are separate tests. For women older than 21 years, the pelvic examination is typically performed as part of the well-woman visit, even when cervical screening is not indicated.\n\n\n\n\nChaperones typically accompany the provider performing the pelvic examination, although, in usual practice, female providers frequently do not have them present.\n\n\n\n\nFear of the pain associated with a pelvic examination is a barrier to consistent care,\n [3] and patients need reassurance. The clinician should establish patient rapport. Making the patient feel at ease, maintaining eye contact, being aware of the patient’s involuntary muscle contraction, selecting the appropriate speculum, clearly explaining the steps of the examination (and providing advanced warning of each step as the examination progresses), and explaining the findings are helpful during a pelvic examination.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Physical Assessment for Electrodiagnostic Medicine": "\nOverview\n\n\nAs with any meaningful medical consultation, the electrodiagnostic medicine consultation must begin with obtaining a pertinent history and performing a physical examination. The history is not discussed in this article, but it obviously forms the basis of the ensuing examination by providing an understanding of the referring question, the patient's symptoms, and relevant past medical, surgical, and social history.\nThe physical examination can be quite variable, depending on the clinical history. The examination might range from a very focal neurologic assessment, as might be the case in a focal neurologic injury (eg, knife wound to digital nerve), to a multisystem, generalized examination, as might be needed in a systemic disease presentation (eg, paraneoplastic syndrome). The physical examination should be detailed enough to provide clear differential diagnoses, as well as to help direct any later electrodiagnostic evaluation.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \n\n\nWithout an appropriate history and physical examination to guide the sequence and choice of specific electrodiagnostic tests, electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCSs) become an exercise in miscellaneous data collection, which can be misleading, useless, or even potentially dangerous.\n [8, 9] This article starts with a brief description of general and musculoskeletal examination components but focuses primarily on the neurologic examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Psychiatric Forensic Interview": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA psychiatric forensic interview can include a number of different evaluations.\n [1] The interview may be part of expert witness testimony in a criminal or civil trial, or it may be an independent medical evaluation for an insurance company, employer, or disability provider. In each case, the entity requesting the evaluation is seeking the expertise of psychiatrist to clarify medical issues as they relate to legal issues.\n [2, 3] \n\n\nForensic evaluations fundamentally differ from routine provision of clinical care, despite significant overlap in how they are performed. The opinion generated by the interview could be helpful, harmful, or neutral to the person being evaluated. These points distinguish a clinical psychiatric interview from a forensic evaluation because of the practical and ethical implications. The relationship is not doctor-patient, but rather evaluator-evaluee.\n [4] As such, the medical principal of primum non nocere is not applicable.\nThe evaluator-evaluee context is a departure from the typical physician-patient relationship. The evaluee should demonstrate a clear understanding of this distinction, especially as it relates to privacy and consequences of examiner findings.\n\n\n\n\nThe interview may include the use of standardized instruments that are more sensitive to malingering, given the higher degree of scrutiny due to secondary gain in a forensic setting. The use and interpretation of these instruments should be approached with caution by practitioners without formalized training.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of collateral documents and information collected through collateral interview can also help to identify consistency or inconsistency with evaluee reports and with the expected course of illness. Because of the wide variation in clinical questions addressed by forensic interviews, questions that are beyond a typical clinical scope should be clarified with the retaining attorney. Assuming the referring question is appropriate, the question should be addressed in a written report if one is requested.\n\nIndications\nThe need for a forensic evaluation is generally prompted by the need for an objective opinion regarding the presence, severity, or treatment of a mental illness. They may be used in criminal or civil court, by employers, or by insurance companies to determine the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetency to stand trial\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nNot guilty by reason of insanity\n\n\n\n\nMitigation\n\n\n\n\nPersonal injury\n\n\n\n\nParental fitness or custody\n\n\n\n\nGuardianship\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nCompetency to enter into a contract\n\n\n\n\nTestamentary capacity\n\n\n\n\nFitness for duty\n\n\n\n\nRisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nDisability\n\n\n\nEven within these diverse categories, there is additional variation based on the party requesting evaluation. For example, different jurisdictions have different criteria to define “not guilty by reason of insanity.” Similarly, different insurance policies have variations in their construction to determine when an evaluee receives payment.\n\nBecause of this diversity of purposes and standards, it is imperative to have as exact a standard as possible before agreeing to provide an evaluation. Clarification with the retaining party, prior to agreeing to serve in an expert capacity, ensures sufficient information to form an opinion.\n\nContraindications\nThe primary relative contraindication for a forensic evaluation is an existing treatment relationship with the evaluee. This contraindication is not absolute, but it is important to be clear to all parties involved that a treatment relationship precludes an ideal degree of objectivity. A doctor-patient relationship generally assumes that the physician is an advocate for the patient rather than an impartial evaluator. Furthermore, the desire to maintain a working treatment relationship may impact findings. Finally, the patient enters into the treatment relationship with expectations about privacy and the nature of the relationship.\n\nFor example, a patient who has engaged in psychotherapy for an extended period with a provider may reveal information that he or she would elect not to provide to a neutral evaluator. This patient may have done so with the expectation that the information would be used to provide effective care rather than provide information for a legal proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, providers should consider their own expertise with regard the referring question. For example, assessing the risk for sexual violence recidivism may be outside the scope of a typical practitioner.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nIt is customary best practice that the evaluator be retained by a referring attorney, not the evaluee directly. This avoids similarities to a treatment relationship and ensures that the evaluee has an opportunity to consult with an attorney before engaging in a forensic evaluation. This consultation should include clarification of the referring question, ideally including the exact language from a statue or contract related to the forensic question.\n\nProcedure Planning\n\nPrior to accepting a request for a forensic evaluation, it is necessary to obtain adequate clarification of the reason for consultation. If possible, obtain a copy of the written legal standard, with clarifications about the legal interpretation of the terms. This type of clarification can also help to identify questions that are not specific enough to give an opinion or questions that are beyond the scope of a forensic evaluation.\n\nOutcomes\nForensic evaluations frequently have an effect on the legal outcome of the case in question. This outcome may be favorable or unfavorable to the evaluee; therefore, thorough informed consent (or at least notification) is recommended. Details about the informed consent procedure are provided in Periprocedural Care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

It is the authors' intention to also provide additional hints in how to effectively obtain information during that interview. This format is most appropriate for new patient interviews but can also be of value for existing patients whose psychiatric history has never been fully explored.\nEach interview will be unique; for example, the length and depth of the interview with an acutely psychotic inpatient varies considerably from that of an outpatient struggling with many years of anxiety. Regardless, the essential goals for data collection within a psychiatric interview remain similar, and a consistently applied format is valuable.

        "Radioactive Iodine Uptake Testing": "\nBackground\n\n\nRadioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) testing is a useful diagnostic tool for assessing thyroid pathologies. The RAIU test is a reliable measurement when using a dedicated probe with a reproducibility of 1% and a 95%-least-significant-change of 3%.\n [1] \nThe atom is the smallest unit of an element. An atom consists of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons revolve around the nucleus (made of protons and neutrons) in fixed orbits. The number of electrons equals number of protons in a neutral atom. Electrons can be entirely removed from an atom by absorption of energies that exceed the binding energies of the electrons, causing the atom to be ionized.\n [2] These excited atoms can release energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic force manifests itself as waves or particles called photons. A nuclide that releases radiation is called a radionuclide.\n\n\nIn the nuclide (nucleus), the number of neutrons (N) plus the number of protons (Z) equal its mass number (A). In the case of iodine-131 (131 I), the atomic number Z (number of protons) is 53 and number of neutrons is 78. So the total mass number is 131. An unstable nuclide tries to attain stability through radioactive decay releasing alpha, beta and gamma rays. In medicine, this radiation is used for diagnosis and treatment.\nA normal thyroid gland traps about 10–35% of ingested radioiodine through the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS).\n [3] NIS is also present in the salivary glands and breast, but only the thyroidal NIS is regulated by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Thyroidal NIS cannot distinguish between radioactive and non-radioactive iodine (iodine-127). More than 20 radionuclide of iodine are recognized, but only iodine-123 (123 I) and131 I are commonly used for clinical purposes. On certain occasions iodine-124 and iodine-125 are used.\n\n\n\n\nBecause123 I has a comparatively short half-life and emits only (gamma) photons, it is ideal for diagnostic testing.131 I has a half-life of 8 days and emits beta rays as well as gamma rays. This makes it useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. But the use of131 I for routine diagnosis is discouraged because the radiation dose is about 100 times stronger than that of123 I.\n\n\n\n\nOther noniodide radionuclides are used for the evaluation of patients with thyroid disorders include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnetium pertechnetate (99mTcO4): This is more widely used than123 I because of availability and cost.\n [4] Unlike123 I, which is both concentrated and organified within the thyroid, technetium pertechnetate is only concentrated in the thyroid.\n\n\n\n\n111In-pentreotide: This is a somatostatin analogue used in imaging medullary thyroid cancer and other neuroendocrine tumors.\n [5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nThallium-201 (201T1)\n\n\n\n\n99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-sestamibi)\n\n\n\n\n99mTc-tetrafosamin\n\n\n\nSee the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThyroid anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive different scintigrams taken from thyroids with different syndromes: (A) Normal thyroid; (B) Graves disease, diffuse increased uptake in both thyroid lobes; (C) Plummer disease (toxic multinodular goiter); (D) Toxic adenoma; (E) Thyroiditis (marker 99Tc). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Rational Use of Screening and Diagnostic Tests": "\nOverview\n\n\nDiagnostic tests help physicians revise disease probability for their patients. When ordering a test, the physician should always do so in order to answer a specific question. The 5 main reasons for a diagnostic test are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablish a diagnosis in symptomatic patients -  For example, electrocardiography to diagnose ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients with chest pain\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\nScreen for disease in asymptomatic patients - For example, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men older than 50 years\n\n\n\n\nProvide prognostic information in patients with established disease - For example, CD4 count measurement in patients with HIV\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nMonitor therapy to ensure appropriate dosing - For example, measuring the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients taking warfarin\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nA test may be performed to confirm that a person is free from a disease - For example, pregnancy testing to exclude the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy\n\n\n\n\nA criterion (reference) standard test definitively indicates either presence or absence of a disease. Examples of criterion standard tests include pathological specimens for malignancies and pulmonary angiography for pulmonary embolism. However, criterion standard tests routinely have drawbacks: they are usually expensive, less widely available, more invasive, and riskier. These issues usually compel physicians to choose other diagnostic tests as surrogates for the criterion standard test.\nFor example, venography, the criterion standard for vein thrombosis, is an invasive procedure with significant complications including  acute kidney injury, allergic reaction, and clot formation. These risks make venography less desirable than the alternative diagnostic test—venous duplex ultrasonography. The price most diagnostic tests pay for their ease of use compared with their criterion standard is a decrease in accuracy. How to account for this trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and patient acceptability is the subject of this article.\n\n\n\n\nPatient Diagnostic and Screening Decisions\nDecision aids such as pamphlets, videos, or Web-based tools may be used to help patients make informed decisions regarding diagnostic and screening options when there is more than one option, when no option has a clear advantage, and when the risk-benefit profile may be valued differently.\n\n\n\n\nA Cochrane review of decision aids for patients facing treatment or screening decisions found that the use of these aids improved knowledge of the options and helped patients have more accurate expectations of possible benefits and harms, reach choices that are more consistent with informed values, and participate in decision making with health practitioners.\n [5] Smaller improvements were seen with the use of more detailed decision aids compared with simpler decision aids. The use of decision aids had no apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Screening for Cognitive Impairment": "\nPre-Procedure\n\n\nBackground\nScreening for dementia and other cognitive impairments is increasingly important as our population ages. However, controversy exists as to who should be screened, when, where, by whom, and with what instruments. Considering the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of available screening instruments, treatments available (or not) for the conditions for which patients are being screened, and risks of false positive or false negative results is important.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \n\n\nAn image depicting temporospatial EEG characteristics can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive decline is associated with alterations in the temporospatial EEG characteristics, specifically seen as a decline in resting alpha frequency. However, these findings are non-specific, and medication effects must be ruled out. \n\n\n\n\n\nIndication\nThe American Academy of Neurology suggests cognitive screening when cognitive impairment is suspected.\n [5]  In 2020, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nContraindication\nCertain cognitive screening tests cannot be used with patients who have various handicaps, for example, aphasia or physical limitations in their ability to write.\n\nPreparation\nOptimally, cognitive screening tests that are used have sufficiently high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. False positive results and the attendant emotional distress represent a potential complication. For this reason, young and healthy patients in whom no reason exists to suspect a cognitive disorder should not have a cognitive screen performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Tuberculosis Screening": "\nOverview\n\n\nLatent tuberculosis infection is a condition in which a person is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-complex but does not have active tuberculosis disease. People with latent tuberculosis infection are at risk of progressing to active tuberculosis. Therefore, it is essential that individuals at high risk of progression to active tuberculosis are identified through screening.\nNearly one-third of the world’s population has latent tuberculosis infection.\n [1] Risk of progression varies based on age and comorbid conditions.\n [2] The greatest risk for progression to active disease occurs within the first 2 years of infection, during which time about 5% of individuals progress to tuberculosis disease. After the first 2 years following infection, the risk of developing active disease over an individual’s lifetime is 5–10%.\n [3] \n\n\nThere is no direct test to detect the presence of latent tuberculosis infection in an individual. The screening tests for latent tuberculosis infection rely on measurements of adaptive host immune responses to the bacteria. The tuberculin skin test measures an individual’s response to a solution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis -complex antigens, known as purified protein derivative.\n [4, 5] \nUntil the early 2000s, the tuberculin skin test was the standard for screening for latent tuberculosis infection.\n [6] However, the test has limitations, including precise intradermal administration, the need for a follow-up visit to interpret the results, specific criteria for interpretation of the results, and the possibility of false-positive results with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination or other environmental mycobacteria.\n [6] Because of this, interferon-gamma release assays are gaining acceptance as an alternative screening test.\n [7, 8] Because interferon-gamma release assays are performed in the laboratory, requiring one blood draw and only one patient visit to obtain results, they are significantly distinct from the traditional tuberculin skin test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Videourodynamic Testing": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nIn clinical practice, urodynamics are obtained to reproduce clinical symptoms while allowing for precise measurements in order to identify the underlying causes for the symptoms and to quantify the related pathophysiologic processes.\n [1] Urodynamics may confirm a diagnosis or result in a new diagnosis. A careful assessment of the patient’s history and physical examination helps determine the question(s) that one hopes to answer with urodynamic evaluation.\n\n\nIn an effort to provide some standardization to urodynamic studies, the International Continence Society has developed guidelines for good urodynamic practice for the measurement, quality control, and documentation of urodynamic studies in both clinical and research environments.\n [1] In addition, the report from the standardization subcommittee of the International Continence Society provides definitions for urodynamic observations.\n [2] Practitioners performing and interpreting urodynamic studies should be aware of such guidelines and terminology.\nIndications\nUrodynamic studies may be obtained for various lower urinary tract symptoms, including the evaluation of incontinence, overactive bladder symptoms, and urinary retention.\n [3] Urodynamics may be obtained to guide initial treatment, to follow progress with treatment or to evaluate treatment failures. In patients with neurogenic bladder/sphincter dysfunction, urodynamics are often obtained to evaluate the risk for upper urinary tract damage in those with bladder/sphincter dysfunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nUrodynamics should not be performed in the setting of a symptomatic urinary tract infection. Urodynamics should be obtained to assist in further management of a patient’s lower urinary tract symptoms.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nUrodynamic study has several components, as follows: (1) uroflowmetry, (2) filling cystometry (cystometrogram, CMG), (3) pressure flow study of voiding, and (3) electromyelography (EMG).\n\nAn image depicting a cystometrogram can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCystometrogram (CMG) demonstrating poor bladder compliance. Detrusor pressure increases with bladder filling. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe choice of which components to perform depends on the patient’s symptoms and the urodynamic questions one seeks to answer. Having a bladder diary completed for 2 days before performing the urodynamic evaluation is helpful. The bladder diary serves to confirm the patient’s symptoms as well as provide some assistance with the urodynamic studies. For example, one can determine the average volume voided during the bladder diary, which will help prevent over-filling of the patient’s bladder during the cystometrogram.\n\nPotential complications from an urodynamic evaluation include urethral trauma leading to hematuria, dysuria, or false passage. In addition, although infrequent, the risk of developing a urinary tract infection exists. Thus, placement of the urethral catheter during the study should be performed using sterile technique with a well-lubricated catheter. In patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and those on clean intermittent catheterization, a urine dipstick should be checked prior to starting the urodynamic evaluation. If significant pyuria on the dipstick exists, then the procedure is not performed and the urine is sent for culture. Patients with chronic indwelling catheters should have urine cultures obtained and be treated just prior to urodynamics.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe anatomy of the bladder forms an extraperitoneal muscular urine reservoir that lies behind the pubic symphysis in the pelvis. A normal bladder functions through a complex coordination of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychological functions that allow filling and emptying of the bladder contents. The prime effector of continence is the synergic relaxation of detrusor muscles and contraction of the bladder neck and pelvic floor muscles. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross anatomy of the bladder. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Bladder Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n"

        "Aberrometry and Wavefront Imaging": "\nHistorical Perspective\n\n\nSnellen visual acuity was developed at a time when the only possible refractive correction of the optical system of the eye was spherocylindrical glasses, and the surgical techniques of treating eye diseases were less advanced.\n [1] The 20/20 Snellen visual acuity was considered normal vision and the goal of treatments and surgeries. This measurement of visual function does not suffice for a full understanding of vision quality, nor is it adequate for the current clinical practice of refractive surgery. Many people have visual acuity that is better than 20/20, and real-world visual performance also includes low-contrast objects under low or high illumination.\nWavefront analysis technology has enabled physicians to measure higher-order optical aberrations in addition to spherocylinders in clinical practice. These measurements can be used to describe the optical properties of the eye and to detect optical irregularities of the visual system that contribute to visual quality.\n [2, 3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Anterior Segment and Fundus Photography": "\nExternal Ocular Photography\n\n\nOf the several types of ophthalmic photography, external eye photography is the least reliant on sophisticated instrumentation. Readily available components (ie, camera body, lens, flash) can be configured into an apparatus that can be used for virtually all photodocumentation of the external eye and adnexa. Based on the simple system, the external camera can be used for photography of one eye alone, both eyes together, and full face views, in addition to intraoperative photography and even nonmedical imaging.\nIn a major market change, traditional film-based cameras are being supplanted by digital technology. Most prosumer digital cameras currently lend themselves to the precise composition and magnification standards required for medical photography. These cameras with their digital sensors are rivaling film for color, contrast, sensitivity, and resolution. The potential benefits of electronic imaging are significant. High-quality digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras have become increasingly affordable and are beginning to replace standard film-based 35 mm SLRs. When selecting a camera, it should feature interchangeable lenses that can be used in full manual mode rather than as an exclusively automatic instrument. If a practice uses electronic health records, images from a digital camera can be directly imported or film-based images can be scanned and converted to digital files.\n\n\nThe highest magnification generally considered useful for external eye photography assignments is 1:1, or life size on film, combined with a sufficiently long focal length to provide natural perspective and adequate space for subject lighting. Several lens and accessory combinations provide these parameters, including a macro lens plus bellows, a macro lens plus teleconverter, and a macro lens with integral extended focusing mount. Of these choices, the last 2 are the most practical.\nThe combination of a 50 mm or 60 mm f/2.8 or f/3.5 macro lens and a 2X teleconverter can be focused from infinity to a 1:1 magnification ratio without the need for supplemental close-up devices. Longer focal length (100-105 mm) macro lenses are available with extended helical focusing mounts, which allow them to focus to the same magnification, again without requiring additional components. The difference between the 2 examples above is the wide-open viewing aperture; the latter lenses allow a bright f/2.5 or f/2.8 view, while the former configuration only transmits light through a rather dim aperture of f/5.6 or f/7. The brighter view is especially useful when attempting to photograph a dark iris.\n\n\n\n\nThe next component, the light source, should be selected from the variety of small electronic flash units that are commonly available. A manual flash is perfectly adequate for this application. However, a camera body equipped with off-the-film (OTF) or through-the-lens (TTL) flash control circuitry may provide for better exposure; an automatic flash dedicated to that exposure system is also acceptable. It is important to note that many newer digital systems use external flash units that are proprietary for use of TTL technology.\n\n\n\n\nThe point source quality of illumination from the standard electronic flash yields high-quality photographs in any of the 3 standard magnifications (ie, one eye, both eyes, full face). The cornea acts like a convex mirror; hence, the reflection of the electronic flash appears in the photograph. When a single eye is photographed, the light source must be small so that its reflection does not obscure any required detail.\n\nA ring flash also has been used successfully for photography of strabismus cases in which the standard view is both eyes together.\n [1] In that application, its reflection on the cornea is acceptably small. It cannot be used for successful photography of a single eye because its proximity to the eye creates a very large reflection on the corneal surface that may obscure detail. If only one camera setup is to be used for all external ocular photographic assignments, then one with a point source type of electronic flash is more universally applicable.\n\nThe electronic flash is attached to the front of the macro lens by means of a special rotating flash bracket. One of the most useful such brackets has set screw adjustments that allow the flash to be positioned in 5 different positions within a 180° arc, enabling the light source to be positioned with precision. Such a device is available from Adolph Gasser, Incorporated (5733 Geary Boulevard, San Francisco, Calif). This bracket is also useful when camera orientation must be changed between horizontal and vertical.\n\nThis camera, lens, and flash combination can be used as a portable instrument in the clinic, in patient rooms, or even in the operating room. However, a higher degree of focusing accuracy and compositional standardization can be achieved by mounting the camera on a focusing stand that also has provision for patient head support. Sometimes, such stands can be adapted from pieces of obsolete clinical equipment (eg, keratometers). If such dedicated equipment is not available, try to stabilize the patient's head in another way. An examination chair with headrest can be a useful expedient for external ocular photography. Alternatively, ask the patient to sit against a wall, and then to press the head back so it touches the wall.\n\nA number of digital sensors from major manufacturers and color transparency films are suitable for external ocular photography. For finest granularity, a film of medium speed (ISO 50, 64, or 100) is preferred. On a DSLR, the sensor will have different gain settings that are represented by the familiar ISO ratings from the film realm. Use the lowest setting to reduce any digital noise. Keeping these ISO settings on your digital sensor below 400 will ensure the best quality image. The DSLR will come equipped with presets for different light sources (eg, flash, fluorescent, tungsten, daylight, auto). Setting this to auto will allow the camera to judge the lighting conditions milliseconds before the exposure is made. When attempting to obtain the most lifelike recording of skin, the flash output may require modification with an ultraviolet absorbing filter (eg, Kodak Wratten 2E).\n\nAs with any other clinical photographic equipment, a series of tests should be undertaken to determine the proper flash settings and exposure parameters before using the equipment on actual patients.\n\nIf a manual flash is used, the exposure test should include a series of bracketed exposures (at half-stop increments) at the 3 customary magnifications: 1:1 (one eye), 1:4 (both eyes together), and 1:10 (full face).\n\nIf an automatic flash is used with OTF or TTL metering, the goal should be a rather small f-stop (ie, f/22) for single eye views, where depth of field would otherwise be quite shallow.\n\nFor photography of one eye at 1:1 magnification, the angle of the flash is set to aim at the eye from the superior temporal or temporal position; these positions are chosen because they avoid the problem of the nose obstructing the beam and causing an unintended shadow. Adjust the location and angle of the flash so that the anticipated location of its reflection misses the major pathology. This can be predicted easily; when the patient assumes primary gaze, the reflection always is located between the corneal apex and the limbus in the same quadrant as the flash position relative to the lens. Thus, if the flash is set directly above the lens, then the reflection appears in the superior cornea. Preset the lens magnification to its 1:1 setting, and set the aperture to the predetermined setting. Instruct the patient to look in the direction that presents the proper aspect of the eye to be photographed.\n\nAlthough the conventional anterior-posterior (A-P) or primary gaze photograph is often appropriate, additional photographs in which the camera position or the patient's direction of gaze is changed often may result in a more informative image. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA photograph made at 1:1 shows the eye in anterior-posterior (A-P) view. Use of small lens apertures enhances the appearance of sharpness through extended depth of field. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nNext, in a smooth continuous movement, move the camera toward the subject, while carefully assessing the composition and focus in the viewfinder or liquid crystal display (LCD). When holding the camera, a modified sharpshooter stance and grip are required. Hold the right side of the camera body with the right hand so the index finger is able to reach the shutter release button. The left hand should cradle the lens from below. The elbows should be tucked in, and the feet should be spread slightly. Focusing is accomplished by leaning in and/or bending at the waist.\n\nSmall specular highlights often provide useful clues about focus; they are smallest when the camera is focused on the plane where they are located. At the instant when the subject comes into critical focus, take the photograph. With practice, this technique allows fast and accurate focusing.\n\nBy presetting the magnification ratio and then focusing by moving the entire camera assembly, the same magnification for all images is ensured. Scientific validity is compromised if the lens is focused by adjusting its focusing ring because this also changes the image magnification. This technique and equipment is also applicable to ophthalmic surgical photography. By quickly and fluidly leaning in, making the photograph, and leaning out, the interruption to the procedure is limited.\n\nWhen a photograph of both eyes together is needed, use a 1:4 reproduction ratio. This allows the center of the image to be located at the bridge of the patient's nose, with a complete view of both eyes and both temporal orbits. Careful camera work results in a symmetrically composed photograph. Place the plane of sharpest focus at the level of the corneas; again, a small specular reflection provides a reliable indicator for use in focusing. Place the flash directly above the lens to provide symmetrical illumination for both eyes. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1:4 reproduction ratio permits recording of both eyes together. In anterior-posterior (A-P) view, this photograph provides subtle visual clues about the patient's proptosis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAlthough the primary gaze (A-P) position is usually appropriate, a different camera position occasionally might be required. For example, in the case of thyroid ophthalmopathy, proptosis can be recorded most effectively by shooting down from a position above the patient's head. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy changing the viewpoint, this image provides a more emphatic recording of proptosis of the right eye. For a complete recording, both anterior-posterior (A-P) and superior viewpoints are useful. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe photographic motility series or views of the 9 cardinal gazes require a standardized series of photographs in which only the direction of the patient's gaze changes from photograph to photograph.\n [2] These directions are ordered precisely and include straight ahead, straight up, up and right, straight right, down and right, straight down, down and left, straight left, and up and left. Standardize the order of imaging; if a patient has severely affected eye movements, it is easier to identify individual positions of gaze through the order of photographs. If a muscle imbalance is to be documented, have an assistant gently raise the patient's upper eyelids when photographing the 3 views that include a downward component.\n\nAn assistant also can give the patient a target for proper positioning of the various gazes. Since patients often tend to turn their heads in the direction of eye movements, they should be reminded to maintain a fixed head position and to move only their eyes during the photographic session.\n\nAs facial photographs are uniquely recognizable, ask the patient to sign a photographic release form prior to photography. If the photographs are published later, the necessary legal documentation is already available.\n\nPhotography of the full face requires a magnification ratio of 1:10. Because this size allows a small area of background to appear in the photograph, carefully choose the background color. To avoid any unusual color casts on the subject resulting from reflected light or from the psychological effects of juxtaposition, a matte finish neutral gray color should be used. If neither a formal photographic studio room nor the space for a roll of seamless background paper is available, one wall of a room in the clinic may be finished with neutral gray paint of between 18-36% reflectance. If space permits, seat the patient several feet in front of the wall to avoid recording any wall texture or sharply defined shadows. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight is an essential component of photographic imaging. By directing the light source from above, the superior sulcus defect above the right eye is seen more clearly. This facial image was produced at a reproduction ratio of 1:10. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nHold the camera parallel to the frontal plane of the face. Ensure that the patient maintains this parallel position; many patients incline their heads when posing, perhaps in an attempt to camouflage a double chin. The camera must be held on the same horizontal level as the center of the face because undesired psychological effects and skewed facial geometry may result if the camera is directed at the patient from either a superior or an inferior position.\n\nOn rare occasions, images of hands, feet, skin, and other body parts may be needed to document pathology that is linked to ophthalmic findings. The simple system is equally useful for these assignments. Keep a few pieces of gray illustration board available; these can provide suitable backgrounds for views of the hands or feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe goal of treatment in glaucoma is to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in order to slow down retinal ganglion cell loss. This can be achieved with medications, which typically constitute the first line of treatment, laser treatment, or surgery.\nContemporary argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) was introduced as a treatment modality for open-angle glaucoma by Wise and Witter\n [1] based on observations by Ticho and Zuberman,\n [2]  who demonstrated that argon laser treatment of angle structures could lower IOP without causing full-thickness openings through the trabecular meshwork (TM). The mechanism of action is widely debated. It is thought that (1) thermal energy directed towards the TM causes focal scarring of trabecular beams that constitute the TM, thereby opening up space in adjacent structures (mechanical theory), or that (2) inflammatory cytokines induce structural changes and allow repopulation of the TM with dividing trabecular epithelial cells from untreated areas, which are more effective in phagocytosis and result in a different composition of extracellular matrix with improved outflow facility properties (biological theory).\n [3] \n\n\nWith appropriate patient selection, IOP is reduced by 25-30% 1 year after ALT. However, the effect fades over time, with an attrition rate of about 10% per year. Traditionally, patients considered to be ideal candidates for the procedure are older and phakic with sufficient TM pigmentation. However, newer reports have confirmed only pre-treatment IOP as a significant predictor of a successful response.\n [4] In patients younger than 50 years, ALT is not usually performed unless significant TM pigmentation is present due to exfoliation or pigment dispersion syndrome.\nLong-term studies have shown that ALT maintains IOP control in 67-80% of eyes 1 year after the procedure and in 30-50% of eyes 5 years after the procedure.\n [5, 6] ALT can be repeated, targeting the remainder of the TM (typically half of the angle is treated initially), but the effect to be expected is modest, especially if the first treatment session had poor outcomes. Repeat ALT success rates after initial favorable response range between 21% and 70%, with a fading effect over time.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nThe Glaucoma Laser Trial performed over 3 decades ago has demonstrated equivalency between ALT and medical treatment as initial treatment modalities in patients with open angle-glaucoma. In the Glaucoma Laser Trial, 11% of the ALT-treated eyes required repeat ALT or glaucoma filtration surgery at the end of follow-up. In comparison, 34% of the eyes in the medical arm required ALT or glaucoma filtration surgery at the respective time-point.\n [7] However, the results of the study may not be directly applicable to current glaucoma practice as the newer prostaglandin analogues became available after study initiation.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) was introduced by Latina et al.\n [8] SLT is a quick, painless, outpatient procedure with quick patient recovery and a good safety profile. It uses a non-thermal 532nm Q switched, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser delivering a short laser pulse (of 3nsec duration) targeting the pigmented cells of the trabecular meshwork while achieving similar results,\n [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]  without causing visible thermal or mechanical damage to the TM structures.\n [15, 16]  Other similar approaches that have been investigated include diode laser trabeculoplasty, titanium sapphire laser trabeculoplasty (TLT), pattern scan laser trabeculoplasty (PLT), and micropulse laser trabeculoplasty, (MDLT) with different laser wavelength characteristics, spot size, and laser pulse length.\n [3, 17] \n\nA few studies have compared SLT to modern medical treatment as primary and adjunctive therapy,\n [12, 13, 18, 19]  whereas some have also modelled the cost-efficacy of SLT compared to prostaglandin analogues, mainly in healthcare systems where medication cost is relatively high.\n [20, 21]  \n\nIn 2019, the Laser in Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension (LiGHT) randomised controlled clinical trial reported that SLT allows 78% of treated eyes to maintain IOP control without the use of medications or the need for surgery 3 years after treatment, while also leading to a reduced number of glaucoma surgeries and very low rates of adverse events when compared with the use of eye drops.\n [22, 23]  SLT also was found to be more cost-effective than initial treatment with IOP-lowering drops for the UK’s fixed-budget national healthcare system. These findings led to the update of the guidelines issued by the American Academy of Ophthalmology\n [24]  and the European Glaucoma Society.\n [25]  In 2022, the LiGHT trial  reported that 69.8% of the eyes treated with SLT maintained IOP control for 6 years without the need for medical or surgical treatment, with fewer eyes showing disease progression and fewer eyes requiring trabeculectomy, when compared with medical treatment.\n [26] \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Chalazion Procedures": "\nOverview\n\n\nA chalazion is a chronic noninfective inflammation of the sebaceous glands of the eyelid that affects the meibomian glands in the tarsal plate. Clinically, it results in a painless, firm nodule of the eyelid. Marginal chalazia are caused by inflammation of the gland of Zeis located at the lid margin. They can affect both the upper and lower lids. Acne rosacea and posterior blepharitis are commonly associated with chalazion. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E (Job syndrome) can be associated with aggressive chalazion.\nMeibomitis predisposes to the formation of chalazion; the inflammation leads to blocking of the duct opening, resulting in clogging of the secretions and then swelling. This results in a chalazion and hardening of secretions with time. Chalazion is a noninfective condition. However, it can become infected and acutely inflamed, causing a tense, warm lid swelling called hordeolum internum. This is how meibomitis is linked to the pathogenesis of chalazion formation and recurrence.\n\n\nOn histological slides, it appears as deep dermal or subcutaneous suppurative lipogranulomatous inflammation containing neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and giant cells in a zonal configuration around central lipid material. A pseudocapsule surrounds the cellular infiltrate.\n [1] Many chalazia resolve within 2 weeks of a topical antibiotic and steroid medication and application of warm compresses.\n [2] These aid in reducing inflammation and increasing the local blood supply.\nIncision and curettage is a conventional and effective treatment of chalazion (see the image below).\n [2, 3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph of a left lower lid chalazion. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases of multiple chalazia with no evidence of infection, local intralesional injection of triamcinolone may cause regression of the chalazion within a few weeks.\n [4] It can also be used as an alternative to standard surgical procedure.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Conjunctival Foreign Body Removal": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nConjunctival foreign bodies of the eye are common and can be removed with proper technique. A conjunctival foreign body should be suspected if a patient presents with a sensation of something in the eye. Patients with a conjunctival foreign body often state that their eye feels as if an irritating object—like grit, “junk,” sand, or glass—is in it but that they cannot localize exactly where the sensation is. The foreign body sensation is often worse upon blinking when the foreign body is located on the conjunctival (inner) surface of the upper lid.\n\n\nTechnical Considerations\nBefore embarking on removal of the foreign body, ensure that a conjunctival foreign body is the cause of the presenting complaint, and perform an appropriate preprocedural assessment.\n\n\n\n\nProcedural planning\nBefore any manipulation of the eyelid or eye, measure the visual acuity in both the affected eye and the fellow eye. A conjunctival foreign body should not cause a significant decrease in visual acuity.\n\n\n\n\nBefore pressing on the eyelid or eye, make certain that no penetrating injury of the eye has occurred. Such an injury should always be considered when there is a history of power tool use or of hammering metal with metal (see the image below). If something on the bulbar conjunctiva is not easily removable with a cotton swab, it could be a penetrating foreign body or a conjunctival pigmented lesion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetrating metallic foreign body—not simple conjunctival foreign body. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nComplication prevention\nTo minimize the chance of complications, take a careful history, and always perform a visual acuity determination and a corneal and anterior chamber examination. In addition, use an ophthalmoscope to look for the presence of a red reflex.

        "Contact Lens Removal": "\nOverview\n\n\nAlthough most patients are capable of removing their own contact lenses, proficiency in contact lens removal is a useful skill for any clinician. Patients may present to the emergency department because of difficulty removing their own lenses or with acute ophthalmological complications of contact lens wear. In some instances, contact lens removal is necessary for examination purposes. Consideration should also be given as to whether patients with altered mental status (eg, comatose) may be wearing contact lenses.\nProlonged contact lens wearing times are associated with an increased risk for corneal hypoxia and edema, infection, and corneal vascularization. Contact lens removal also is necessary following ocular trauma; however, in severe trauma, where globe rupture is suspected, an ophthalmologist should be involved before any ocular examination or intervention.\n\n\nThe technique of contact lens removal varies slightly depending on the type of contact lens. Two main types of contact lenses are available: soft contact lenses or hydrophilic lenses, and rigid gas-permeable lenses (RGPs). A 2021 analysis of international contact lens prescribing habits revealed 86% of patients wear soft lenses, whereas the remaining patients either wear rigid gas-permeable lenses (11%) or orthokeratology lenses (3%).\n [1] \nSoft contact lenses\nThese lenses are made from oxygen-permeable material and are generally the most tolerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of soft contact lens include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Disposable contact lenses: These lenses are designed for short-term use. These lenses are not suitable for wear while asleep and need to be cleaned carefully and stored. Daily disposable lenses have increased in popularity over the past decade and make up 36% of US contact lenses worn.\n          \n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\n          Extended-wear contact lenses: Superpermeable silicone hydrogel lenses may be worn up to 30 days continuously, even while asleep, although wearing contact lenses overnight is not recommended. Overnight wearing of contact lenses increases the risk for infectious corneal ulcers by 10 to 15 times over daily wear.\n          \n [3] \n\n\n\nRigid gas-permeable lenses\nRGP lenses are made of synthetic materials that do not contain water. The most popular material for their manufacture is fluorosilicone acrylate. The rigidity of hard lenses means they are generally easier to handle than soft contact lenses.\n\nThe typical RGP lens diameter is 9.8 mm (the typical soft lens diameter is 14.0 mm). Rigid lenses cover only 50% of the area covered by a soft contact lens and are smaller than the cornea.\n\nRGP lenses are more mobile on the eye than are soft contact lenses; therefore, they allow increased tear circulation beneath the lens. Increased tear circulation allows the transfer of more oxygen to the corneal surface.\n\nRGP lenses have been shown to be less likely than hydrogel materials to cause corneal infections. In one study comparing the relative risk of soft contact lens types to RGP lenses, extended-wear soft contact lenses had a relative risk for any complication of 2.7, compared with a relative risk of 1.3 for daily-wear soft contact lenses.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Affected individuals often devise home remedies, such as taping the lid down to the cheek to rotate it away from the globe for comfort.\n [3] \n\nLike ectropion, entropion is classified into distinct categories on the basis of etiology, as follows\n [3] :\n\n\n\n\n\nCongenital entropion - Commonly affecting the lower lids, this is a roll of pretarsal skin that abuts the lashes and rotates them inward; it is quite common in persons of Asian descent and usually resolves as the face matures; if it does not, excision of the skin roll with suture closure is used as a remedy, with minimal scarring and little aesthetic downside\n\n\n\n\nCicatricial entropion - This results from scarring of the palpebral conjunctival or tarsoconjunctival tissue, leading to inward rotation of the lid margin; worldwide, trachoma is the most common cause, with others including chemical burns, cicatrizing diseases, and trauma; treatment involves addressing the underlying problem with immunosuppression (in the case of ongoing cicatrizing disease) or scar release and grafting; suture rotation repair of the lid margin, with or without lid fracturing techniques, may be appropriate for less severe forms of the disease or cases where the availability of supplies and practitioners is limited\n\n\n\n\nInvolutional entropion - This results from a triad of conditions, (1) dehiscence of the lower-lid retractors from the inferior tarsal border, (2) horizontal lid laxity, and (3) relative enophthalmos of the globe; the effect of relative enophthalmos is best appreciated by having the patient lie in the supine position, which typically elicits the transient entropion as the globe sinks into the eye socket\n\n\n\nThe management of involutional entropion (see the images below) is described in detail in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvolutional entropion of left lower eyelid. Patient has both horizontal laxity of eyelid and dehiscence of lower-eyelid retractors. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient has involutional entropion with dehiscence of lower-eyelid retractors and horizontal eyelid laxity. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFinally, some patients develop a forme fruste of involutional entropion that is attributable to early changes from the triad described above. Spastic entropion can result in ocular irritation, which is compounded by an overactive pretarsal orbicularis oculi. The vicious circle of spasms and entropion can often be broken by taping the lid away from the globe, placing bandage contact lenses, or injecting botulinum toxin into the pretarsal orbicularis oculi. Some of these patients eventually need surgical repair of the involutional entropion.\n\nIndications\nCommon indications for ectropion repair include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumented ectropion with chronic eye irritation despite topical lubrication\n\n\n\n\nExposure keratopathy\n\n\n\n\nChronic keratoconjunctivopathy\n\n\n\n\nTearing related to outflow (punctal ectropion or tear pump dysfunction)\n\n\n\n\nTearing related to reflex (chronic irritation)\n\n\n\n\nChronic dermatitis from tear irritation of periocular skin\n\n\n\nCommon indications for entropion repair include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nKeratoconjunctivopathy due to lash/skin-globe touch\n\n\n\n\nOcular irritation\n\n\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to surgical repair of either entropion or ectropion are usually based on the medical condition of the affected patient.\n\nUncontrolled systemic hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, or cardiac disease, as well as systemic anticoagulation (eg, with aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin), may be contraindications. These issues should be discussed with the primary physician before surgery so that the risk-benefit profile for intervention can be weighed against that for observation.\n\nIn patients with cicatrizing conjunctival diseases, surgical intervention should be approached cautiously. An autoimmune or inflammatory component should prompt consultation with the patient's rheumatologist or primary physician so that immunosuppressant medications can be managed and optimized before the surgical repair, which may exacerbate the underlying condition.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nThe success of entropion or ectropion repair depends on good surgical technique.\n\nBest practices\nMeasures that will help optimize surgical repair of these conditions include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nOpt for dissolvable sutures near the lid margin and canthi; if removable sutures are used, consider blue polypropylene, because silk and nylon can blend in and be confused with the normal eyelashes\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid globe injuries, always pass full-thickness eyelid sutures away from the globe; free needles are useful if double-armed suture is unavailable\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid having to work in a tight space, always pass full-thickness lid sutures before horizontally tightening the eyelid\n\n\n\n\nConsider low-dose botulinum toxin as a temporizing measure to provide comfort in patients with spastic entropion\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\"Measure twice and cut once\" when deciding on the amount of horizontal tissue to excise; overresection can lead to dehiscence, canthal angle dystopia, and narrowed horizontal palpebral fissures\n\n\n\n\nConsider nightly eye shields in the postoperative period to avoid patient rubbing and possible wound dehiscence\n\n\n\n\nConsider reverse Quickert sutures for residual ectropion after horizontal tightening to allow additional lid margin inward rotation; these are full-thickness sutures similar to Quickert sutures, but they enter just below the inferior tarsal border and exit more inferiorly on the skin surface of the lower eyelid\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nConsider a medial spindle procedure for residual punctal ectropion in tearing patients; this entails removal of a wedge of posterior lamellar tissue inferior and lateral to the punctum, which is then closed primarily, resulting in an inward rotation of the lid margin and punctum\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nConsider softening the mild to moderate cicatricial component of ectropion with corticosteroid-containing ophthalmic ointments applied to the skin; this measure may obviate the need for skin grafts altogether or limit the size of the skin graft required\n\n\n\n\nIf the effect of ectropion is unclear, use the tape test to tighten the lid horizontally and gauge the effect on the patient's symptoms\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nIf entropion is difficult to appreciate in the examination chair with the patient seated upright, place him or her in the supine position to see if this elicits the entropion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Lacrimal System Probing and Irrigation": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nProbing and irrigation is a procedure used to assess the anatomy and functional status of the lacrimal drainage system. When done correctly, it is a well-tolerated and safe procedure that provides extremely useful diagnostic information, as well as assists surgical planning when pathology is encountered.\n\n\nIn cases of trauma, this procedure can help assess the integrity of the system and look for the presence of canalicular injury (see Laceration, Canalicular). It is also very useful in cases of epiphora, which is defined as overflow tearing\n [1] due either to primary or secondary overproduction of tears or to inadequacy of the lacrimal drainage system. In addition, the procedure is very efficacious for treating congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.\nThe lacrimal drainage system (see Nasolacrimal System Anatomy) begins at the puncta, which are located medially on the margins of the upper and lower eyelids. Each punctum leads to its own canaliculus. These canaliculi pass approximately 2 mm vertically, then turn 90º and run 8-10 mm medially to join the lacrimal sac (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions of lacrimal drainage system. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 90-98% of patients, the canaliculi join to form a common canaliculus that enters the lacrimal sac.\n [2, 3] At this point, some patients have a fold of tissue that is thought to create a functional 1-way valve preventing reflux into the canaliculi. This membrane is referred to as the valve of Rosenmüller (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLacrimal drainage system anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe lacrimal sac lies in a bony fossa in the anterior medial orbit and extends inferiorly to form the nasolacrimal duct. This duct measures 12 mm length and has a distal valve, the valve of Hasner, before it opens into the nose through an ostium at the inferior meatus.\n\nThis ostium is patent in only approximately 50% of infants at birth. If it is not patent at birth, it usually becomes patent during the first few months of life. Delayed or incomplete patency is the cause of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Also of importance in the infant population is that the distance from the punctum to the level of the inferior meatus is approximately 20 mm.\n\nIndications\nProbing and irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system should be performed whenever analysis of the lacrimal drainage system is indicated.\n\nIn the case of nasolacrimal obstruction–related epiphora, this procedure provides vital insight into the location and severity of obstruction if present. The results not only help identify the cause of a patient’s epiphora but also assist in surgical planning if the results are abnormal.\n\nIn the case of trauma to the eyelid or medial face, probing and irrigation can help determine if there is injury to the lacrimal drainage system. In the setting of acute trauma, a visible lacrimal probe inserted in the canaliculus or leakage of irrigation fluid through a traumatized eyelid is an indication of canalicular injury that must be addressed during planned repair of the trauma.\n\nIn the case of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction that does not resolve by the age of 12 months,\n [4] probing of the canaliculi and the nasolacrimal duct is performed with the patient under anesthesia to achieve patency in the system.\n\nContraindications\nThe main contraindications are acute dacryocystitis and acute canaliculitis.\n\nIn the case of obstruction due to acute dacryocystitis, palpation of a distended lacrimal sac produces reflux of mucopurulent material from the canalicular system. This reflux confirms complete nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and no further diagnostic testing is indicated. In the setting of active infection, probing and irrigation is more likely to cause trauma because the lacrimal sac wall is inflamed and friable; it also can cause unnecessary pain and anxiety for the patient.\n\nThe concerns in canaliculitis are similar to those in dacryocystitis. Active infection can make passage of a probe or cannula difficult, and iatrogenic trauma is more likely to occur in these cases. A particular concern in canaliculitis is the frequent presence of stones within the canaliculus. Probing and irrigation can force these stones deeper into the canaliculus, making subsequent removal more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "LASIK for Correction of Astigmatism": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nAstigmatism is important to address during surgical correction of refractive errors. It is important to understand the steep and flat axes of the cornea, the potential for posterior corneal astigmatism, and lenticular astigmatism when analyzing the patient's condition. For patients undergoing laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or photorefractive keratoplasty (PRK), the concept of irregular astigmatism or higher-order aberrations is also taken into consideration. For patients undergoing cataract surgery, the ability to correct astigmatism with either corneal-relaxing incisions or toric lens implants is important. Many patients desire this type of treatment when they undergo cataract surgery, so it should be discussed with them at the time of the cataract evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Lateral Canthotomy and Cantholysis": "\nOverview\n\n\nOrbital compartment syndrome is an ocular emergency that requires expedient diagnosis and management to prevent blindness. The orbit is a closed compartment created by strong periosteum connections of the orbital septum. An expansive process posterior to the orbital septum leads to rapid expansion in orbital volume and subsequent increase in orbital pressure. Untreated, orbital compartment syndrome results in ischemia of the optic nerve and retina.\n [1] For more information, see Acute Orbital Compartment Syndrome.\nThe most common causes of orbital compartment syndrome include retrobulbar hemorrhage from trauma (especially if in hypocoagulable state),\n [2]  retrobulbar anesthetic injection, and eyelid surgery. Spontaneous retrobulbar hemorrhage due to venous anomalies, atherosclerosis, intraorbital aneurysm of the ophthalmic artery, hemophilia, leukemia, von Willebrand disease, and hypertension are uncommon but also have been described. Other causes include prolonged prone positioning,\n [3] orbital cellulitis (with or without subperiosteal abscess), expanding tumor, orbital emphysema (patient blows nose after a blowout fracture), orbital inflammatory syndrome, and  aggressive fluid resuscitation in patients with burns due to third-spacing of fluid in the orbit.\n [4, 5] \n\n\nPatients with increased orbital pressure present with pain, proptosis, decreased vision, dyschromatopsia, diplopia, limited extraocular movements, ecchymosis around the eye, bloody chemosis, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), resistance to retropulsion, and a relative afferent pupillary defect.\nThe lateral and medial canthal tendons attach the eyelids to the orbital rim and are in continuity with the orbital septum, which limits anterior displacement of the globe.\n [6] Orbital pressure can be relieved with an emergent lateral canthotomy and cantholysis.\n [7] Without decompression, increased orbital pressure can cause irreversible vision loss due to direct compressive optic neuropathy, central retinal artery occlusion, compression of optic nerve blood supply, or ischemic optic neuropathy from stretching of blood vessels.\n [8]  This loss of vision may occur in as little as 90-120 minutes.\n [9, 10] Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential for vision loss prevention.\n [11] Knowledge of this potentially sight-saving procedure is important for clinicians, especially those in remote areas where access to an ophthalmologist is not readily available.\n [12] Cases of prehospital lateral canthotomy and cantholysis performed by licensed and credentialed individuals, as well as lateral canthotomy and cantholysis completed with improvised tools, have been reported.\n [13, 14, 15] \n\n\n\n\nRelevant anatomy\n\n\n\n\nThe orbit, which protects the globe, is shaped like a cone with four walls.

        "Low Vision Therapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nLow vision is a general term that refers to a permanent functional vision loss that cannot be corrected by medication, surgery, or glasses. Low vision patients may experience a wide array of diseases, field defects, and degrees of vision loss. However, in general, low vision can be defined as a bilateral decrement to visual acuity or visual field resulting from a disruption of the visual system. This decreased acuity or field results in an impaired ability to perform work, leisure, or daily living activities. It is already known that low vision in adults does impair quality of life, and one study demonstrates that children with visual impairment had significantly lower quality of life scores than an age-matched comparison group using the Low Vision Quality of Life Questionnaire. This research reinforces the need for low vision services for children.\n [1, 2, 3] \nA low vision examination should detail the kinds and the quality of visual deficits afflicting patients and how they are adapting to their vision loss. This may include a chief complaint, as well as social, functional, and ocular health history. A low vision examination should detail the kinds and the quality of visual deficits afflicting patients and how they are adapting to their vision loss. This may include a chief complaint, as well as social, functional, and ocular health history. The low vision functional history includes details of a patient’s visual challenges and goals for work, leisure and activities of daily living (ADLs). The occupational needs assessment is detailed to discuss technology and mobility requirements of the job, as well as travel to and from work. The activities of daily living explore hobbies, and access to technology such as cell phone, tablet or computer. Other tasks such as meal preparation and self-care (grooming, taking medications) are discussed. The social history includes living situation challenges such as stairs, as well as assistance available and the patient’s household responsibilities.\n [4] \n\n\nLow vision acuity and refraction often requires such nonstandard acuity measures as the Feinbloom low vision chart with numerals in the size range of Snellen 700 to 10. Distance acuity often is measured at varying distances (eg, 10 ft, 5 ft). Trial lens refraction is recommended to ensure accurate vertex distance to allow for eccentric eye or head position.\nNear acuity is measured at 40 cm (ie, 0.40 m) with the patient's correction in place, with +2.50 D add if the patient is presbyopic. The add power needed to read average size print (ie, 1 M, 20/50 Snellen equivalent, Jaeger #5) is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the near acuity. For example, a patient reading 4 M print (20/200 Snellen equivalent) at 40 cm would require a +10 diopter (D) add to read 1 M print (1/0.40 m/4 M).\n\n\n\n\nOne option to speed up the add calculation is to use the Lighthouse Near Acuity Test chart (at 40 cm test distance), which includes precalculated adds for each acuity. To determine the necessary magnification, divide the best-corrected acuity by the desired acuity. For example, the best-corrected acuity is 20/200 and the desired level of acuity is 20/40, so the required magnification is 5 X (200/40).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLighthouse near acuity chart. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nVisual field\n\nGoldmann visual field testing provides information regarding peripheral fields to 180 degrees. This test is needed when testing for driving. The Humphrey field analyzer can go to 60 degrees for details information about central fields. On the other hand, an Amsler grid is used to map out a central scotoma for patients with central vision loss from macular degeneration, macular edema, etc. Another test is now available for central fields called the California Central Visual Field test, which can more precisely map out scotomas. The results of the central vision tests help in rehabilitation using a peripheral retinal locus. In other words, the patient may use eccentric viewing to find the clearest image.\n\nContrast sensitivity\n\nContrast can be tested using the ETDRS low contrast acuity chart or the Pelli Robson contrast sensitivity chart. In low vision, the Pelli Robson chart is preferred because it separates contrast from acuity: all letters are the same size but in decreasing contrast order. The patient reads the chart and is scored by the last 2 of 3 correct in a given contrast level. The test may be performed monocularly to follow disease progression, or binocularly to predict functional vision deficits. Patients with poor contrast sensitivity have difficulty recognizing faces, seeing the edges of curbs and steps and seeing details with sub-optimal lighting conditions.\n\nTask lighting\n\nLux IQ test allows patients to choose the brightness (Lux) and warmth of color (degrees Kelvin) for optimal task lighting. The subjective lighting levels may be entered in the Lightchooser website to give up to date suggestions of lamps and bulbs.\n\nIn summary, functional vision analysis for each patient includes visual acuity for distance and near, visual field, contrast sensitivity and perhaps color vision, and optimal task lighting preferences. Each patient is unique in functional vision loss. One patient may only have blurred vision while another has bothersome scotomas or faded vision (contrast sensitivity loss). Understanding how each patient sees enables us to provide tools to meet each patient’s goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos show normal view and views with reduced field and reduced contrast with blur.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAbove photos show normal view, reduced visual field view, and blurred with reduced contrast view. Each patient may differ in their functional vision measures of acuity, visual field, or contrast sensitivity.\n\nThe goal of low vision rehabilitation services is to optimize the use of functional vision to the best of the patient’s ability. Success is when a patient can achieve his or her goals in accomplishing a task. The rehabilitation plan may include magnification, enhanced contrast, task lighting, colored filters, computer/cell phone adaptations and even text to speech options. \n\nLow Vision therapy may include services from an optometrist providing optical and electronic devices, an occupational therapist providing adaptive equipment/techniques to promote success in activities of daily living, and an orientation and mobility instructor for navigating safely/white cane training. Some patients may also need referrals for psychological services when coping with vision loss is a struggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nd-YAG Laser Capsulotomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nNeodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy is a relatively noninvasive procedure that is used in the treatment of posterior capsular opacification. Posterior capsular opacification is a common long-term complication of cataract surgery that causes decreased vision, glare, and other symptoms similar to that of the original cataract.\n [1] Posterior capsular opacification is caused by a proliferation of lens epithelial cells, which causes fibrotic changes and wrinkling of the posterior capsule. Its reported frequency ranges from 8.7% to 33.4%.\n [2, 3, 4, 5] \n\n\nLaser capsulotomy uses a quick-pulsed Nd:YAG laser to apply a series of focal ablations in the posterior capsule and create a small circular opening in the visual axis. Yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) capsulotomies were developed in the early 1980s by Drs. Aron-Rosa and Fankhauser. Aron-Rosa had a strong background in physics prior to becoming an ophthalmologist and an especially keen interest in the early ruby lasers of the time. She found that the pulses were too slow for her intention, which was to determine a laser beam wavelength that would not disrupt the integrity or temperature of surrounding tissue within 100 μm of the target. \nBy multiplying the Nd:YAG frequency, Dr. Aron-Rosa was able to use the laser in various wavelengths. She applied for a patent in 1978 and began her clinical trials in October of that year. Over the next 4 years, she performed the procedure in 5000 eyes.\n [6] In November 1980, Fankhauser performed his first YAG capsulotomy.\n [7] The procedure caught on quickly because the alternative was surgical dissection of the posterior capsule, which is a more inherently invasive procedure. With the older intraocular lenses, opacification rates could be as high as 50%.\n [8] As the intraocular lens technology has improved, the rates of opacification have decreased greatly. \n\n\n\n\nIndications\nIndications for Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference with daily activities\n\n\n\n\nDecreased vision (patients with multifocal intraocular lenses may be particularly sensitive to even small posterior capsular changes) \n\n\n\n\nIncreased glare\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty visualizing the fundus\n\n\n\n\nLens tilt and Z syndrome associated with hinged accommodating lenses such as the Crystalens and Trulign toric lens (lens tilt occurs when one haptic is planar and the other haptic is vaulted anteriorly or posteriorly; Z syndrome occurs when one haptic is vaulted anteriorly and the other is vaulted posteriorly) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases of a small anterior capsulorrhexis, capsular phimosis or capsular contraction can occur. This excessive scarring anterior to the intraocular lens can compromise vision. It can be alleviated by radial anterior capsulotomies, which can be achieved with the Nd:YAG laser.\n [9] \n\nContraindications\nRelative contraindications for Nd:YAG capsulotomies include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nCorneal scarring or edema that prevents a clear view during the procedure\n\n\n\n\nPlacement of a glass intraocular lens during cataract surgery\n\n\n\n\nPresence of iritis in the eye\n\n\n\n\nMacular edema in the retina\n\n\n\nUse caution in the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients with a history of retinal tears or detachments\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nPatients in the immediate postoperative period because the intraocular lens may not be adequately scarred into place\n\n\n\n\nPatients with glaucoma, who may have an intraocular pressure spike from the inflammation or postoperative steroid response\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Ocular Cryotherapy": "\nBackground\n\n\nOcular cryotherapy is the therapeutic use of cold temperatures to treat disorders of the lids or eyes. Cryotherapy has been used in ophthalmology since the mid-1960s. With the exception of cataract extraction, ocular cryotherapy is generally used as a surface technique, with the probe being applied to the lids or eye without any incision into the tissue. Because of the absence of an incision, it is considered to be a less invasive type of procedure than incisional surgery.\nMedical use of cryotherapy is based on the tissue changes induced by subfreezing temperatures. Living tissue responds to extremely cold temperatures through ice formation, both within cells and also in the extra cellular fluid surrounding cells. In addition, subfreezing temperatures cause ice formation within small blood vessels, interrupting blood supply to adjacent cells. A combination of these factors destroys living tissue through ischemia and necrosis and induce inflammation as a response to cell death.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

This was a monumental advance in ophthalmology because it allowed, for the first time, controlled access to the posterior segment of the eye.\nInitially, vitrectomy was used primarily to clear the vitreous of opacities such as blood. However, technological advancement with better vitrectomy systems and advanced instrumentation allow for this procedure to be used in a much greater number of applications.

In the first step, an expanding gas bubble is injected into the vitreous cavity and the patient is positioned so that the bubble closes the retinal break, permitting resorption of subretinal fluid. The second step entails induction of a chorioretinal adhesion around all retinal breaks with cryopexy, laser, or both.\n [3, 4, 5] \n\n\n\n\nThe main advantage of pneumatic retinopexy over scleral buckling is the minimization of complications such as inadvertent scleral perforation by scleral sutures, postoperative refractive error changes, strabismus, and potential complications associated with the drainage of subretinal fluid.\n\n\n\n\nThe initial success rate of pneumatic retinopexy is lower than that of scleral buckling, but the final anatomic and functional results are comparable. The lower initial success rate is due to a higher frequency of new retinal breaks and missed retinal breaks.\n [6] \n\nHowever, an initial failure of pneumatic retinopexy does not affect the final visual outcome.\n [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] In a comparative trial of eyes with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment involving the macula for 14 or fewer days, the visual outcomes following pneumatic retinopexy were statistically better than those following scleral buckling.\n [14] A 2019 randomized controlled trial demonstrated that eyes treated with a pneumatic retinopexy achieved better visual acuity, less vertical metamorphopsia, and less morbidity than eyes that underwent pars plana vitrectomy.\n [15] Studies have shown that, if pneumatic retinopexy were more popular, significant cost savings may be achieved.\n [16, 17] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Scleral Buckle": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA scleral buckle is performed to repair a retinal detachment by reestablishing the anatomic proximity of separated retina from its underlying tissue. An acute retinal detachment is an ophthalmologic emergency that can rapidly progress to irreversible vision loss in the affected eye.\n\n\nThe neurosensory retina depends on its underlying layers (the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid) for delivery of oxygen, trophic factors, and nutritional substrates. Therefore, any damage or disruption in the conduit between the layers has great potential to lead to ischemic damage and cell death. The vast majority of detachments are caused by the formation of tears (rhegma) in the retina, which allow the entrance of liquefied vitreous into the subretinal space, leading to subsequent separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium.\nThe principle of scleral buckling is based on the need to collapse the anatomic space created between the detached sensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. This is done by the inward indentation of the sclera from the exterior, creating a ridge (or buckle) that reduces the fluid underneath the tear and allows for the re-apposition of separated layers, thus reestablishing their physiologic connection. The sclera itself is most commonly indented by placement of a permanent explant or intrascleral implant with sutures, although temporary buckles have been used in variations.\n\n\n\n\nThe external indentation from the buckle explant reduces the volume of the globe, and in doing so relieves a portion of the vitreous traction contributing to the retinal tear and detachment. Although this procedure involves exposure of the globe and considerable intraorbital manipulation, it is most often performed on an outpatient basis.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the placement of the explant to displace the eye wall inward, it is important that the retinal tears are sealed by the formation of chorioretinal adhesions. This is performed by inducing a chorioretinal scar via cryotherapy, diathermy, or laser energy. In conjunction with the generation of such adhesions, the physical closure of the break by the explant/implant enables the attachment of the retina. The dynamic forces that generated the detachment (vitreoretinal traction and inflow of liquefied vitreous) are thus countered by these maneuvers.\n\nOnce secured, the normal physiologic and metabolic forces preventing separation may then maintain retinal attachment. Depending on the extent of detachment, the degree of fluid and any associated pathologies, there may also be indications for auxiliary procedures during the placement of the scleral buckle, such as the removal of accumulated subretinal fluid and/or the injection of intravitreal gas.\n [1] \n\nAlthough modalities such as vitrectomy and pneumatic retinopexy are increasingly used to manage retinal detachments, buckling continues to be an important and useful approach in many clinical scenarios. In addition to the placement of scleral buckles as a primary and solitary procedure, they are often used in combination with pars plana vitrectomy in order to address complicated retinal detachments and provide further support. Given the poor visual outcomes that attend the course of an uncorrected detachment, scleral buckling is most often performed on an emergent to urgent basis, especially in the setting of macula-sparing detachments.\n\nIndications\nScleral buckling is indicated for the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, especially in phakic eyes\n         \n\n\n\n          Young patients with attached posterior hyaloid\n         \n\n\n\n          Detachments due to dialysis without retinal tear\n         \n\n\n\n          Complex retinal detachments involving multiple tears\n         \n\n\nThe most common mechanism causing retinal detachments is the formation of rhegmas or full-thickness tears in the retina. Rhegmatogenous detachments account for 90% of detachments, resulting from the traction exerted on the retina by the posterior vitreous. As the rhegma forms, liquefied vitreous is allowed access to a pathway into the subretinal space. It subsequently acts as a wedge to separate the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium.\n\nAlthough the initial presentation of patients with symptomatic detachment can vary widely, there are common salient features, including the following symptoms:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Photopsia (flashing lights related to mechanical stimulation of the retina through vitreous traction)\n         \n\n\n\n          Floaters (due to detachment of vitreous with or without vitreous hemorrhage)\n         \n\n\n\n          Visual field defects (often described by the patient as a sudden black curtain or veil that may enlarge over time)\n         \n\n\n\n          Decreased visual acuity (noted in detachments involving or threatening the macula)\n         \n\n\nDetachments may be due to dialysis, in which the retina detaches circumferentially from its insertion point at the ora serrata on the retinal periphery. This is a less common etiology and is most often seen in the setting of trauma and in young patients.\n\nRhegmatogenous retinal detachments complicated by tractional forces from proliferative vitreoretinopathy, as well as other proliferative processes such as diabetic retinopathy, require vitrectomy along with scleral buckling when the traction is present in the peripheral retina in order to achieve high success rates of reattachment. These surgeries may also require advanced surgical techniques, such as intraocular gas insufflation, membrane peeling, silicone oil instillation, and creation of retinectomies (incisions in the retina).\n [2] \n\nContraindications\nDetachments that emanate from breaks anterior to the equator (the anterior-posterior circumferential midpoint of the globe) are more amenable to placement of buckles. Breaks significantly posterior to the equator are anatomically more difficult to approach owing to hindrances from the bony orbit and poor surgical exposure. As such, posteriorly located breaks are best addressed with vitrectomy.\n\nOpaque media may preclude visualization of retinal tears and thus proper discovery of all the breaks. This is most often seen in scenarios of vitreous hemorrhage, such as in the setting of severe retinal neovascularization due to diabetic retinopathy.\n\nIn patients with significant vitreoretinal traction, such as with proliferative vitreoretinopathy and diabetic neovascularization, using a scleral buckle exclusively is usually insufficient to reattach the retina. However, buckling may be used as part of the surgical approach in addition to vitrectomy.\n\nMany surgeons prefer to avoid possible anterior ischemia caused by buckling in patients with vaso-occlusive disease, such as sickle cell anemia and, to a lesser extent, severe diabetic retinopathy.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nIf there is a significant tractional component to the retinal detachment, such as in proliferative vitreoretinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a vitrectomy approach needs to be used in order to mechanically peel away the causative membranes.\n [3, 4, 5] \n\nIf subretinal drainage is used, it is important to avoid retinal incarceration into the drainage tract.\n\nProcedure Planning\n\nThe most crucial aspect of any approach to treating rhegmatogenous detachments is the ability to localize and account for all the retinal tears. Failure to locate and treat a tear would predispose any technique to failure because it allows for the new influx of subretinal fluid. When placing a primary buckle, this is performed with intra-operative indirect ophthalmoscopy via the aid of a condensing lens, typically a 20- or 28-D lens. The use of scleral indentation to bring the peripheral retina into view is necessary in order to achieve full visualization.\n\nInitially, full visual acuity testing should be performed to assess the patient’s baseline level of vision. This is crucial in the primary care or emergency department setting. A drastically reduced visual acuity may be an indication of macular involvement and thus may lessen the need for a more urgent intervention. However, even macula involving detachment are best repaired within 7-10 days for optimum visual acuity recovery.\n\nExtraocular muscle testing is important to establish a baseline because strabismus may develop postoperatively.\n\nTonometry is indicated because retinal detachment frequently lowers intraocular pressure. Postoperatively, buckling may increase intraocular pressure as a function of volume reduction. As such, it is important to establish any history of glaucoma.\n\nLaboratory tests, as guided by the medical history, may be requested as part of the preoperative evaluation. Coexisting systemic diseases may increase anesthetic and surgical risks, as well as the potential for local complications (eg, thrombocytopenia).\n\nOutcomes\nPostsurgical visual outcomes are related to the extent of initial macular involvement. Anatomic reattachment is achieved in close to 90% of cases. However, there may be a significant discrepancy between favorable anatomic correction and functional visual outcomes.\n\nThe most important issue dictating success in restoring visual acuity is the presence of macular involvement. In macula-off detachments (in which the detachment includes the central retina, the macula), only 50%-60% of patients have restored visual acuity of 20/50 or better.\n [6] Visual restoration is much more likely in detachments sparing the macula,\n [7] with one large series reporting that 90% of such patients had vision of 20/40 or better following surgery.\n [8] \n\nFactors predicting poor visual function include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Age (>70 y)\n         \n\n\n\n          Macular detachment occurring more than 7 days prior to surgery\n         \n\n\n\n          Severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy\n         \n\n\n\n          Intraoperative hemorrhage\n         \n\n\nOverall, and not surprisingly, the most reliable predictor for poor postoperative outcome is poor preoperative visual acuity.\n [9] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe sensory retina, composed of photoreceptors and adjacent ganglion cells, overlies the retinal pigment epithelium. The blood supply for the sensory retina is derived from two circulations, both originating from the ophthalmic artery. The anterior circulation comes from the retinal artery as it branches into arterioles that course along the surface of the sensory retina and supply the inner (more proximate to the vitreous) layers. Changes in this circulation are seen with vitreous retinopathy, most commonly in patients with diabetes, who are predisposed to tractional detachments. The posterior (uveal) circulation supplies the outer segments of the retina (the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelial). It is the loss of contact with this supply that proves disastrous in the course of detachment.\n\nThe peripheral edge of the retina is defined by the ora serrata, the junction with the ciliary body located anteriorly. In this region, the inner and outer retinal layers are tightly adherent.\n\nThe sclera is the protective outer covering of the eye composed of fibrous connective tissue. It has the structural integrity to support the placement of an explant. The sclera itself is contained within the Tenon capsule, which merges anteriorly with the conjunctiva. These two structures must be penetrated to place the buckle.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Retina Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Engineers, scientists, and surgeons have continued to study alternatives to LASIK because of these uncommon but potentially serious complications.\n\n\nRefractive lenticule extraction (ReLEx) was the byproduct of existing applications—automated lamellar keratoplasty, automated in situ keratomileusis, and femtosecond lasers. In 2007, an intrastromal femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx) was revisited for patients with extreme myopia. In 2011, a small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) procedure was introduced as a third-generation laser refractive surgery procedure. The flap creation was eliminated and replaced with creation of a corneal pocket, in which a lenticule is gently removed from a small keyhole incision, usually 2-4 mm in width. Fewer corneal nerves are severed during creation of the pocket and removal of the lenticule, so dry-eye symptoms and loss of corneal sensitivity may occur less frequently after SMILE.\nThe VisuMax® Femtosecond Laser System is the only laser approved to perform the SMILE procedure.\n\n\n\n\nThe image below shows a comparison of the different treatment steps of SMILE, LASIK, and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMILE treatment steps in comparison to LASIK and PRK.

        "Trabeculectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBefore the development of the trabeculectomy, the available surgical methods of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction had a high rate of serious complications such as hypotony, flat anterior chamber, and endophthalmitis. Thus, in an effort to improve the safety of IOP-lowering surgery, the guarded filtering procedure was developed. Cairns was the first to report success using the trabeculectomy in 1968.\n [1, 2] Cairns' trabeculectomy, with some improvements and modifications at various steps, still is being performed today.\nTrabeculectomy involves the creation of a fistula connecting the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space.\n [1] This provides an alternative method of aqueous humor filtration when the natural trabecular outflow pathway is blocked or poorly functioning in cases of glaucoma. The goal is to create the right amount of flow without causing overfiltration. Its success relies on the continued patency of the fistula and the continued ability of the filtering bleb created out of the conjunctiva to absorb aqueous. Thus, the success of the procedure lies not only on the surgical technique but also in the intraoperative and postoperative measures to modulate wound healing.

In modern times, ampullectomy can be performed as an endoscopic mucosal resection or as a full-thickness resection via duodenotomy by way of laparoscopy or open surgery.\n [1]  Surgical ampullectomy remains a useful treatment option for ampullary lesions, but its utility is limited to a narrow range of indications.\n [2, 3] \nNeoplasms of the ampulla of Vater are a small subset of the broader category of biliary tract neoplasms. These lesions demand separate consideration from their biliary counterparts because of their unique location and behavior. In general, localized resection of papillary, ampullary, and periampullary neoplastic lesions should be considered only if these lesions are benign. Malignant disease of this region is associated with extraordinarily high recurrence rates (approximately 80% local recurrence with malignant disease and up to 40% local recurrence with nonmalignant dysplasia) with local resection alone, mandating radical resection via pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n\nAlthough there has been some discussion regarding the role of ampullectomy in limited circumstances with regard to malignant Tis and T1 ampullary carcinoma,\n [4, 5] this article addresses the details of surgical ampullectomy for benign neoplasia of the ampulla of Vater.\nIn addition, endoscopic technology and tools for periampullary procedures represent a broad subject that deserves a rich discussion elsewhere.\n [6, 7, 8, 9] The present article focuses on the details of open surgical ampullectomy, with acknowledgement of laparoscopy as a valid technologic variant that is at the disposal of the surgeon who has already mastered open surgical ampullectomy.\n\n\n\n\nHistopathologic variants of ampullary neoplasia\nAmpulla of Vater neoplasias include a diverse array of lesions, including those that arise from genetic predisposition, spontaneous mutation, or spontaneous occurrence. The earliest manifestation of disease occurs in the common channel of the ampulla, perhaps reflecting a mutagenic nature of bile. The most common cause of heritable ampullary neoplasia is familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which progresses from adenoma to malignancy along the well-described pathway of mutagenesis for colon cancer.\n\n\n\n\nVariants include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Adenoma to adenocarcinoma of the ampulla - These include FAP and \n          hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n          Squamous cell carcinoma of the ampulla\n         \n\n\n\n          Neuroendocrine tumors of the ampulla\n         \n\n\n\n          Well-differentiated carcinoid tumors - These have unpredictable behavior patterns, are often asymptomatic, have unpredictable recurrence rates, and are difficult to diagnosis with endoscopy\n         \n\n\n\n          Granular cell tumors of the ampulla\n         \n\n\n\n          Benign lesions - These include lipomas, paraganglionomas, other tumors of neurogenic origin, lymphangiomas, leiomyofibromas, adenomatous polyps, and small intraductal benign adenomas of the common bile duct (CBD)\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Anal Fistulotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAnorectal abscess, which can be an incapacitating condition, originates from a cryptoglandular infection in the anal canal. Anal fistula, or fistula-in-ano, is a persistent, abnormal tract from the anal canal to the perianal skin; it is estimated to occur in 50% of patients with anorectal abscess.\n [1] \nAnal fistulae are hollow tracts lined with granulation tissue connecting a primary (internal) opening inside the anal canal to a secondary (external) opening in the perianal skin. Obstruction of anal crypt glands leads to suppuration, which then forms a tract into an anorectal space; the direction taken determines the anorectal abscess location and hence the type of fistula. To understand the different types of anal fistulae (see Technical Considerations), clinicians must be familiar with the different anorectal spaces from which abscesses arise (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnorectal spaces. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nWhereas treating an abscess can be rather straightforward, treating an anorectal fistula can be difficult for the surgeon and frustrating for the patient.

        "Anal Surgery for Hemorrhoids": "\nBackground\n\n\nHemorrhoids result from disruption of the anchoring of the anal cushions. They occur most commonly in the right anterior position and are associated with straining and irregular bowel habits. During defecation, straining engorges the cushions, resulting in their displacement. Repetition of this displacement results in stretching and eventual prolapse of the anal cushions, known as hemorrhoids (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\nHemorrhoids. Image reproduced from original with permission of the American Society of Colon & Rectal Surgeons. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nConstipation and all conditions that result in abnormal anal pressure and compliance predispose to the formation of hemorrhoids. Acquired conditions such as portal hypertension cause engorgement of these venous plexuses, which can also contribute to anal cushion displacement. Pregnancy can also cause or aggravate symptoms; direct pressure may play a role, but other factors (eg, hormonal fluctuations) may contribute.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and consistent diarrhea can cause hemorrhoidal disease. Any patient with a combination of hemorrhoidal and IBD should be viewed with caution.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nClassification\nHemorrhoids may be broadly classified as either external or internal. External hemorrhoids are located distal to the dentate line and cause pain when they thrombose. This area is covered with sensate squamous epithelium, and thus, the patient typically reports pain, swelling, itching, or a combination of these symptoms.\n\n\n\n\nInternal hemorrhoids are located proximal to the dentate line. This area is composed of insensate columnar-glandular epithelium. Internal hemorrhoids bleed, prolapse, or both. Patients typically present with sudden painless bleeding, usually after a bowel movement. Patients should undergo anoscopic examination or colonoscopy to rule out malignancy or diverticular disease.\n\nInternal hemorrhoids may be graded as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Grade I (primary) - These slide below the dentate line with strain but retract with relaxation; patients are typically treated with dietary changes, including increased fiber intake; if hemorrhoids persist, sclerotherapy or rubber band ligation may be offered\n         \n\n\n\n          Grade II (secondary) - These prolapse past the anal verge but reduce spontaneously; patients are typically treated with sclerotherapy or rubber band ligation\n         \n\n\n\n          Grade III (tertiary) - These prolapse past the anal verge and must be reduced manually; depending on the size of the hemorrhoids and the symptoms noted, patients may be treated with sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation, or surgery\n         \n\n\n\n          Grade IV (quaternary) - These prolapse past the anal verge and are not reducible; surgical treatment (eg, hemorrhoidectomy) is indicated\n          \n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Bariatric Surgery": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nObesity is a major health problem worldwide and has reached an epidemic proportion in the Western society. Evidence continues to accumulate that obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\nThe most widely accepted measure of obesity has been the body mass index (BMI). This number is calculated by dividing a patient's mass (kg) by his or her height (m2). A normal BMI has been considered to lie the range of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2. A BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2 has been considered overweight. A BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater has been classified as obese; this classification has been further subdivided into class I, II, or III obesity.\n\n\nConsidering other factors (eg, total muscle mass, waist circumference) besides the BMI may be important. For example, an extremely muscular individual may have an elevated BMI without being considered overweight. Waist circumference has been shown to be an excellent indicator of abdominal fat mass. A circumference of greater than 88 cm (35 in.) in women or greater than 102 cm (40 in.) in men strongly correlates with an increased risk of obesity-related disease.\nBariatric surgery is currently the only modality that provides a significant, sustained weight loss for morbidly obese patients, with resultant improvement in obesity-related comorbidities. A prospective, controlled Swedish study involving 4047 obese patients, half of whom had undergone bariatric procedures, followed up over 14.7 years, found that compared to usual care, bariatric surgery was associated with a significantly reduced number of cardiovascular deaths and a lower incidence of cardiovascular events in obese adults.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nIn 1954, Kremen and Linner introduced jejunoileal bypass, the first effective surgery for obesity in the United States. In this procedure, the proximal jejunum was connected directly to the distal ileum, bypassing 90% of the small intestine out of the intestinal stream of ingested nutrients (blind loop). The procedure induced a state of malabsorption, which led to significant weight loss.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, many patients developed complications secondary to malabsorption (eg, steatorrhea, diarrhea, vitamin deficiencies, oxalosis) or due to the toxic overgrowth of bacteria in the bypassed intestine (eg, liver failure, severe arthritis, skin problems). Consequently, many patients have required reversal of the procedure, and the procedure has been abandoned. This led to a search for better operations.\n\nModifications in the original procedures and the development of new techniques led to the following three basic concepts for bariatric surgery (see Surgical Therapy):\n\n\n\n\n\n          Gastric restriction (adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy)\n         \n\n\n\n          Gastric restriction with mild malabsorption (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)\n         \n\n\n\n          Combination of mild gastric restriction and malabsorption (duodenal switch)\n         \n\n\nThe field of bariatric surgery has been enriched by data from numerous clinical investigations and experience.

        "Biliary Stenting": "\nBackground\n\n\nOver the past few decades, biliary interventions have evolved a great deal. Opacification of the biliary system was first reported in 1921 with direct puncture of the gallbladder. Subsequent reports described direct percutaneous biliary puncture. The technique was revolutionized in 1960s with the introduction of fine-gauge (22- to 23-gauge) needles.\nDuring the 1970s, percutaneous biliary drainage (PBD) for obstructive jaundice and percutaneous treatment of stone disease was introduced. Percutaneous cholecystostomy was first described in the 1980s. With the advent of metallic and plastic internal stents, further applications in the treatment of biliary diseases were developed.\n [1] \n\n\nCurrent percutaneous biliary interventions include percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and biliary drainage to manage benign\n [2] and malignant obstruction and percutaneous cholecystostomy.\n [3] Percutaneous treatment of biliary stone disease, with or without choledochoscopy, is still performed in selected cases. Other applications include cholangioplasty for biliary strictures, biopsy of the biliary duct, and management of complications from laparoscopic cholecystectomy and liver transplantation.\nEndoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided biliary interventions are the subject of increasing interest (eg, in patients with unresectable distal biliary malignant obstruction who failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiography [ERCP]).\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nThe Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) has published standards of practice for biliary stenting.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nThis article outlines the procedure for biliary stenting.

        "Capsule Endoscopy": "\nBackground\n\n\nVideo capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a powerful diagnostic tool that has proved especially useful in imaging the small intestine. VCE technology offers greater magnification than traditional endoscopy while also providing excellent resolution. It is a clinically useful tool for detecting occult bleeding\n [1] and superficial lesions that are not radiographically observed\n [2, 3] ; it may also provide functional information as the capsule moves passively through the small intestine.\n [4] \nThe development of endoscopy enabled direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach, proximal small bowel, and colon.\n [5] However, even with these technologic advances, certain limitations remained in the noninvasive diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract pathology. Much of the small bowel is not accessible with traditional endoscopy or even push enteroscopy (which allows imaging up to 80-120 cm beyond the ligament of Treitz) but can be visualized with capsule endoscopy (see the image below).\n [6] With the development of colon capsule endoscopy, VCE may be applicable as an alternative form of panendoscopy.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages may be recorded at any point after ingestion. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nCapsule endoscopy is superior to radiographic techniques in the detection of mucosal disease and angiodysplasia.\n [8] Investigators have capitalized on the advantages of this approach, revealing an expanding list of clinical indications.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical advances in many areas (eg, optical design, light-emitting electrodes, and image sensors) were essential to the development of VCE, and the design was completed in 1997. In 1999, the first volunteer studies were performed, and high-quality images from volunteers were published in the literature shortly thereafter.\n [9] In 2001, VCE was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients in the United States, and by 2003, capsule endoscopy had already been used in more than 4000 patients.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nResearch is being done on magnetically guided capsule endoscopy (MGCE), which makes use of extracorporeal magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms.\n [10, 11, 12] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Cholangioscopy": "\nBackground\n\n\nCholangioscopy is a noninvasive endoscopic method used for both direct visual diagnostic evaluation and simultaneous therapeutic intervention of the bile ducts.\n [1]  Peroral cholangioscopy overcomes some of the limitations of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Pancreatoscopy is the direct visual evaluation of the pancreatic ducts.\nAlthough cholangioscopy has been in limited use since the 1950s, it has only comapratively recently matured as a noninvasive technique. In the 1970s, Rosch et al\n [2]  and Urakami\n [3]  independently described two different endoscopic methods for peroral cholangioscopy. Since that time, peroral cholangioscopy has been refined largely through advances in endoscopic technique, scope design, and functionality. However, widespread adoption of peroral cholangioscopy was hampered by technologic hurdles until relatively recently.\n [4] \n\n\nEarly cholangioscopes\n [2, 3, 5]  had several limitations: they were very fragile and could break up; required two endoscopists; had only a two-way steering mechanism, which severely limited negotiation of ducts; and lacked working channels and irrigation ports.\n [6]  Thus, in the absence of more modern endoscopic technologies, this procedure was restricted to a few specialized centers worldwide for very specific indications. However, the SpyGlass cholangioscopes (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) overcame many of the limitations posed by these earlier cholangioscopes.\nThe introduction of a sophisticated cholangioscope system for cholangiopancreatoscopy has led many experts to believe that peroral cholangioscopy will become a universally adopted technique for the evaluation and treatment of biliary tract diseases. Indeed, SpyGlass cholangiopancreatoscopy showed promising results in a multicenter international study\n [4]  and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for diagnostic and therapeutic applications during endoscopic procedures in the pancreaticobiliary system.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nCholangioscopy has been shown to be an effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Studies have evaluated clinical efficacy of peroral cholangioscopy in characterizing benign versus malignant natures of biliary strictures, diagnosing intraductal tumors, better defining unknown biliary pathologies, and treating biliary stones.\n [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] \n\n\n\n\nDirect cholangioscopy (DC) using ultraslim gastroscopes was developed as an alternative to mother-and-baby cholangioscopes. DC provides superior imaging, achieves shorter total procedure time, and has a wider working channel for adequate tissue sampling.\n [13, 14] \n\nIn addition, Itoi et al\n [15]  tested a novel multibending prototype peroral direct cholangioscope (PDCS). This study showed that a cholangioscope passed over a guide wire or anchoring balloon had a high diagnostic and therapeutic success rate. However, results were not appealing with the free-hand insertion technique.\n\nPohl et al\n [16]  showed that a short-access mother-and-baby scope (SAMBA) is better than DC with regard to intraductal stability and accessibility of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Mori et al\n [17]  suggested duodenal balloon-assisted cholangioscopy as an alternative technique in cases of failure with conventional ERCP. A digital version of a SpyGlass cholangioscope is being developed and evaluated.\n [13, 18] \n\nImage enhancement of endoscopically visualized tissue can be performed by dye, autofluorescence, narrowband image, or probe-based confocal fluorescence (PCLE) microscopy. Cholangioscopy, with the addition of these enhancing methods, helps to distinguish benign from malignant biliary strictures.\n [19]  PCLE provides microscopic information in real time, incorporating dynamic information such as blood flow, cellular architecture, contrast uptake, and leakage. Initial observational studies reported a good sensitivity and negative predictive value of the PCLE findings in diagnosing malignancy.

The large intestine is the part of the alimentary tract that consists of the cecum, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum. For purposes of simplicity, the term colon is often used to refer to any of the components of the large intestine, save the rectum.\n\n\n\n\nA colectomy that involves removing the entire colon is called a total colectomy. If most of the colon is removed, the procedure is called a subtotal colectomy. When a segment of the colon is removed, the procedure may be called a segmental colectomy, and it may be labeled a right or left colectomy (or hemicolectomy) to differentiate the right and left halves of the large intestine.\n\n\n\n\nIf the prefix \"procto-\" precedes the term colectomy (ie, proctocolectomy), the procedure involves the removal of the rectum in addition to the colon. Removal of only the rectum is referred to as a proctectomy.\n\nOther terms used include low anterior resection (LAR), which classically refers to removal of the sigmoid colon and upper rectum and derives its name from the fact that the dissection is below the anterior reflection of the peritoneal lining. Although the rectum is anatomically distinct from the colon, many pathologic conditions and procedures related to the colon also involve the rectum. For this reason, surgical procedures involving the rectum (eg, abdominoperineal resection [APR]) have also been included in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

It remains the gold standard for the detection of polyps and colorectal cancer. The procedure is a safe and effective means of evaluating the large bowel. The technology for colonoscopy has evolved to provide a very clear image of the mucosa through a video camera attached to the end of the scope. The camera connects to a computer, which can store and print color images selected during the procedure.\nScreening for and surveillance of colorectal cancer are among the indications for colonoscopy. Although colorectal cancer is highly preventable, it remains the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Both men and women face a lifetime risk of nearly 6% for the development of invasive colorectal cancer. Proper screening can help reduce mortality at all ages, and colonoscopy plays an important role in this effort.\n\n\nEndoscopists should, when assigning appropriate screening and surveillance intervals, follow current guidelines. Repeat colonoscopy should be performed in 3 years on all patients with advanced adenomas. If, in average-risk patients, screening colonoscopies are normal or only small distal hyperplastic polyps are present, repeat examinations should not be performed before 10 years.\n [1] \nCompared with other imaging modalities, colonoscopy is especially useful in detecting small lesions (eg, adenomas) that can develop into cancer; however, its main advantage is that it also allows for intervention, because biopsies and polypectomies can be performed.\n\n\n\n\nSee Benign or Malignant: Can You Identify These Colonic Lesions?, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify the features of benign lesions as well as those with malignant potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Diagnostic Liver Biopsy": "\nBackground\n\n\nPracticed since the late 19th century, liver biopsy remains the criterion standard in the evaluation of the etiology and extent of disease of the liver. Paul Ehrlich performed a percutaneous liver biopsy in Germany in 1883. In the late 1950s, Menghini developed a 1-second aspiration technique, which led to wider use of the procedure and broadened its applications.\nSince Menghini, the evolution of liver biopsy has been extensive. At present, percutaneous biopsies are performed primarily by specialists in gastroenterology/hepatology or by radiologists.\n\n\nA variety of approaches may be utilized for obtaining a liver tissue specimen. These include a blind percutaneous approach after percussion of the chest wall, biopsy under the guidance of ultrasonography (US) or computed tomography (CT), intravascular tissue sampling via the hepatic vein, and intra-abdominal biopsy at laparoscopy or laparotomy.\n [1]  An endoscopic US (EUS)-guided approach has been described.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nThe choice of one technique over another is based on availability, personal preference, and the clinical situation. Likewise, various needles are available for use, depending on the approach and on physician experience.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough liver biopsy is generally safe and is considered the criterion standard for the evaluation of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, sampling error, rare complications, and, occasionally, significant patient anxiety do occur. These factors have led to keen interest in the development of noninvasive tests for hepatic fibrosis,\n [7, 8] some of which are commercially available in the United States.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these tests hold promise for reducing the need for liver biopsy, most hepatologists feel that their clinical usefulness is limited at this time. The available tests appear to perform well at the extreme ends of the spectrum of chronic liver disease, but results vary considerably in the intermediate stages of disease that are frequently seen in clinical practice. Lack of validation of these tests in the community settings where they would most likely be used is also a potential shortcoming of the current testing methods.\n\nGuidelines for the clinical use of liver biopsy have been developed by the British Society of Gastroenterology in conjunction with the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Pathology.\n [9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage": "\nBackground\n\n\nAt one time, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), described by Root in 1965,\n [1]  was the diagnostic test of choice for detecting bleeding within the abdominal cavity after trauma. However, the advent and widespread availability of computed tomography (CT), which carries near-comparable sensitivity and superior specificity,\n [2]  have limited the use of DPL to the diagnosis of intra-abdominal hemorrhage in unstable trauma patients.\nCurrently, DPL is performed less frequently than it once was, having been largely replaced by focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) and CT. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) adopted FAST into the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, and the ninth edition of ATLS made DPL an optional skill station, owing to the widespread use of FAST. Still, each of these modalities has unique advantages and disadvantages.\n [3] \n\n\nDPL retains its usefulness, especially in the hemodynamically unstable trauma patient who has a negative or equivocal FAST examination. (See Technical Considerations.) Diagnostic peritoneal aspiration (DPA) is a simpler, faster modification of DPL that appears to have very low rates of failure and complications in the setting of trauma.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) and Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD)": "\nBackground\n\n\nEndoscopic mucosal resection\nEndoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a technique used for the staging and treatment of superficial neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This technique was first developed in Japan for the treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) and has since spread in use throughout the world for various indications, including dysplastic Barrett mucosa and sessile colonic neoplasms. The utility of EMR rests in its ability to do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Provide accurate histologic staging of superficial GI neoplasms\n         \n\n\n\n          Provide a minimally invasive technique for removal of superficial malignancies\n         \n\n\n\nSeveral variations of EMR are currently used, including injection-assisted, cap-assisted, and ligation-assisted techniques. All adhere to the basic principles of identification and demarcation of the lesion, submucosal injection to lift the lesion, and endoscopic snare resection. By virtue of its overall safety and efficacy in appropriately selected patient populations, EMR has become firmly integrated into the diagnostic and treatment algorithms of superficial GI malignancies.\n\n\n\n\nSome authors have also studied the use of EMR in a procedure known as antireflux mucosectomy (ARMS) to treat refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n [1, 2]  \nEndoscopic submucosal dissection\nEndoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was developed to resect larger tumors and aid in achieving higher rates of en-bloc resection than would be possible with EMR. The main goal of ESD is to achieve an R0 resection. In the United States, ESD is primarily performed in select centers by specialized endoscopists experienced in this technique. ESD is generally indicated for the following\n [3] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Tumors that are diagnosed as carcinomas with intramucosal–to–superficial submucosal invasion\n         \n\n\n\n          Lesions with submucosal fibrosis that cannot be removed by EMR even if smaller than 20 mm\n         \n\n\n\n          Cases where a snare is unlikely to enable a successful en-bloc resection with EMR\n         \n\n\n\n          Removal of large polyps, early \n          colorectal cancer, and those lesions that cannot be accessed transanally in patients who wish to avoid major surgical resection\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nEndoscopic and ultrasonographic characterization of lesions\nSeveral classification systems for the staging of early GI cancers that may aid in the prediction of lymph node metastases have been developed. Much of this work was pioneered by Japanese gastroenterologists for the staging and treatment of EGC. The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology (JSGE), working from large databases of EGC resections, classified lesions according to their endoscopic features and the implied risk of mural invasion.\n [4] \n\nThe subsequent Paris classification, developed in 2002 at an international consensus meeting, echoed the structure of the JSGE system. In this classification, superficial (type 0) lesions are divided into polypoid (0-I) and nonpolypoid categories (0-II), which are further subcategorized as pedunculated (0-Ip), sessile (0-Is), slightly elevated (0-IIa), flat (0-IIb), slightly depressed (0-IIc), or excavated (0-III).\n [5]  (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParis classification of superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn the Vienna classification, lesions are divided into two broad categories, noninvasive (low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia [HGD]) and invasive (intramucosal cancer, cancer that infiltrates the submucosa).\n [6] \n\nThe mucosal layer is divided into upper, middle, and lower layers: m1 (epithelium), m2 (lamina propria), and m3 (muscularis mucosae). The submucosa is similarly divided into three layers: sm1, sm2, and sm3. Submucosal tumor involvement of 500 μm or less below the muscularis mucosae is characterized as sm1 (superficial) disease, and involvement past 500 μm is categorized as sm2-3 (deep) disease.\n [5, 7]  The sm1 layer is further divided into sublayers a, b, and c on the basis of the lateral spread within the layer. (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic of lesion penetration as determined by high-frequency endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nHigh-frequency (≥20 MHz) endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) produces an image of the mucosal wall comprising nine separate layers differentiated by their echogenicity. By carefully examining the depth of lesion penetration into the mucosal and submucosal layers, one may determine the risk of lymph node metastases with greater precision.\n [8] \n\nEUS has excellent sensitivity and specificity in accurately diagnosing the tumor depth and lymph node status of esophageal cancer\n [9] and is considered the most accurate imaging modality currently available. Its accuracy ranges from 75% to 82% for T1 disease, from 88% to 100% for T4 disease, and from 72% to 80% for lymph node involvement.\n [10] \n\nA study assessing staging with radiologic and pathologic correlation in patients with esophageal cancer with lymph node metastases who were radiologically staged as N0 reported that whereas EUS, contrast-enhanced (CE) computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT were all more likely to understage nodal disease, PET/CT was more likely to do so than EUS was.\n [11] The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of EUS for N0 vs N+ disease were 55.4%, 42.6% and 75%. Most lymph nodes (82%) were smaller than 6 mm, making direct visualization challenging with current imaging techniques (probably the main reason for the discrepancy between radiologic and pathologic staging). \n\nFalse-positive EUS images are attributed to peritumoral inflammation, whereas false-negative staging is often due to the microscopic spread of tumor not detectable by EUS. Micrometastases have been found in lymph nodes of early esophageal tumors (as many as 44% in one study\n [11] ​). Because of the limitations of the technology, EUS is subject to significant rates of false positive and negative disease; however, EUS followed by EMR and histopathologic analysis remains the standard of care for early esophageal cancer staging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)": "\nBackground\n\n\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a technique that uses a combination of luminal endoscopy and fluoroscopic imaging to diagnose and treat conditions associated with the pancreatobiliary system. The endoscopic portion of the examination uses a side-viewing duodenoscope that is passed through the esophagus and stomach and into the second portion of the duodenum. (See Technique.)\nWith the scope in this position, the major duodenal papilla is identified and inspected for abnormalities. This structure is a protrusion of the hepatopancreatic ampulla (also known as the ampulla of Vater) into the duodenal lumen. The ampulla is the convergence point of the ventral pancreatic duct and the common bile duct (CBD) and thus acts as a conduit for drainage of bile and pancreatic secretions into the duodenum.\n\n\nThe minor duodenal papilla is also located in the second portion of the duodenum and serves as the access point for the dorsal pancreatic duct. Evaluation of the dorsal pancreatic duct with ERCP is rarely performed; indications are discussed below.\nAfter the papilla has been examined with the side-viewing endoscope, selective cannulation of either the CBD or the ventral pancreatic duct is performed. Once the chosen duct is cannulated, either a cholangiogram (CBD) or a pancreatogram (pancreatic duct) is obtained fluoroscopically after injection of radiopaque contrast material into the duct. ERCP is now primarily a therapeutic procedure; thus, abnormalities that are visualized fluoroscopically can typically be addressed by means of specialized accessories passed through the working channel of the endoscope.\n\n\n\n\nBecause ERCP is an advanced technique, it is associated with a higher frequency of serious complications than other endoscopic procedures are.\n [1, 2] Accordingly, specialized training and equipment are required, and the procedure should be reserved for appropriate indications.\n\n\n\n\nA review by Freeman et al, using data from 2004, estimated that about 500,000 procedures were performed annually in the United States.\n [3] However, because of a decrease in diagnostic ERCP with the advent of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), this number is likely decreasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Exploratory laparoscopy also allows tissue biopsy, culture acquisition, and a variety of therapeutic interventions.\n [1, 2] Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) can also be performed during exploratory laparoscopy to evaluate organs that are not amenable to direct visual inspection.\nThe advent of laparoscopic surgery represents a landmark in surgery that initiated a shift from the era of open abdominal surgery to the minimally invasive surgery revolution.\n [3, 4] Today, laparoscopy is the most common and preferred method for addressing a number of routine and complex surgical procedures, such as cholecystectomy, appendectomy, splenectomy, adrenalectomy, and others. Whereas the use of laparoscopic techniques is primarily a relatively recent occurrence, the development of laparoscopy spans three centuries.\n [5] \n\n\nThe main advantages of diagnostic laparoscopy over traditional open laparotomy are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Reduced morbidity\n         \n\n\n\n          Decreased postoperative pain\n         \n\n\n\n          Shorter hospital stay\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is useful for making a definitive clinical diagnosis whenever there is a diagnostic dilemma even after routine diagnostic workup, including patients with nonspecific abdominal pain, hemodynamically stable patients who have sustained blunt or penetrating trauma with suspected intra-abdominal injuries, and critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients with suspected intra-abdominal sepsis or pathologies.\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is an extremely useful staging tool in patients with intra-abdominal cancers (eg, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, or bile duct cancer; solitary/resectable liver metastasis; and lymphoma). By enabling accurate staging, diagnostic laparoscopy permits patient selection for curative resection or neoadjuvant chemotherapy while avoiding nontherapeutic laparotomy, which is associated with a delay in the initiation of chemotherapy.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive description of the role of exploratory (diagnostic) laparoscopy) as an alternative to traditional open exploratory laparotomy in the management of certain intra-abdominal conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Exploratory Laparotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nBy definition, an exploratory laparotomy is a laparotomy performed with the objective of obtaining information that is not available via clinical diagnostic methods. It is usually performed in patients with acute or unexplained abdominal pain, in patients who have sustained abdominal trauma, and occasionally for staging in patients with a malignancy.\nOnce the underlying pathology has been determined, an exploratory laparotomy may continue as a therapeutic procedure; sometimes, it may serve as a means of confirming a diagnosis (as in the case of laparotomy and biopsy for intra-abdominal masses that are considered inoperable). These applications are distinct from laparotomy performed for specific treatment, in which the surgeon plans and executes a therapeutic procedure.\n\n\nWith the increasing availability of sophisticated imaging modalities and other investigative techniques, the indications for and scope of exploratory laparotomy have shrunk over time. The increasing availability of laparoscopy as a minimally invasive means of inspecting the abdomen has further reduced the applications of exploratory laparotomy.\n [1]  Nevertheless, the importance of exploratory laparotomy as a rapid and cost-effective means of managing acute abdominal conditions and trauma cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Gastric Banding": "\nPre-Procedure\n\n\nProcedure Background\nBefore gastric banding is discussed, some background information will be reviewed.\n\nBody fat estimation\nObesity is defined as excess accumulation of body fat that may impair health. A simple and practical, albeit imperfect, method to estimate body fat percentage is the body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from an individual's height (in meters [m]) and weight (in kilograms [kg]) as follows: BMI = kg/m2. BMI has its drawbacks, as it does not account for body fat percentage, and it may overestimate or underestimate body fat composition in certain individuals.\n\nVisceral fat (central obesity) has a much stronger correlation with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. The absolute waist circumference (> 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women) or waist-hip ratio (> 0.9 for men and > 0.85 for women) are both used as measures of central obesity.\n\nHowever, BMI has become a standard method of evaluating height to weight ratio in most individuals, and thus, this calculation has become an indicator of obesity. Thus, BMI is classified as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nBMI less than 18.5 kg/m2: Underweight\n\n\n\n\nBMI of 18-24.9 kg/m2: Normal weight\n\n\n\n\nBMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2: Overweight\n\n\n\n\nBMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater: Obese\n\n\n\nObesity, in turn, can be subclassified into 3 categories, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nClass I: BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2\n\n\n\n\nClass II: BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2\n\n\n\n\nClass III: BMI ≥ 40kg/m2\n\n\n\nGlobal epidemic\nAccording to the World Health Organization, worldwide obesity is nearly three times greater than it was in 1975, with figures for 2016 including over 1.9 billion overweight adults (aged 18 y or older) and, within this population, over 650 million obese individuals (39% and 13% of adults around the world, respectively).\n [6]  Between 2015 and 2016, 39.8% of US adults aged 20 or older were obese, including 42.8% of those aged 49-59 years.\n [7] \n\nThe morbidity associated with obesity is alarming, with an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, among many other comorbidities.\n\nIntervention\nThe need for safe, efficient, and effective means through which patients are able to lose weight and subsequently maintain an adequate body fat percentage is imperative. In this regard strategies aimed at improving healthy eating habits, exercise, and behavioral modification have been only moderately effective in aiding with moderate weight loss. Nonoperative weight loss therapies have not induced long-term weight loss or a sustainable reduction in comorbidities.\n [8] \n\nSurgery has proved to be safe and, so far, is the only method available that can induce and maintain major weight loss.\n [1, 9, 10, 11, 12] One such procedure for weight loss is gastric banding, an example of which can be seen in the video below.\n [13, 14] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacement of a Realize Gastric Band is demonstrated in this video. \n\n\nLap-Band and Realize Adjustable Gastric Band\nThere are 2 types of adjustable gastric bands approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Lap-Band and Realize Band.\n [15] The Lap-Band System obtained FDA approval in 2001, of which the latest models are the Lap-Band AP-L and Lap-Band AP-S.

The maximum fill volume for the Realize Band is 9 mL, whereas that for the Realize Band-C is smaller. Both the Realize Bands are \"one-size-fits-all\"; however, the Realize Band-C has a 14% greater adjustment range than the Realize Band. The Realize Adjustable Gastric Band differentiates itself from the Lap-Band AP series through its sutureless, injection port installation.\n\nOther adjustable gastric bands\nTwo other adjustable gastric bands are in use outside of the United States, neither of which has FDA approval: Heliogast and Midband.

All patients should initially receive conservative management. If this fails to improve symptoms, an office-based or operative procedure may be offered. Office-based treatments include sclerotherapy, rubber-band ligation, and infrared coagulation, Operative treatments include excisional hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy (procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids [PPH]), and hemorrhoid artery ligation (HAL). (See Technique.)\nDespite several years of study, the main etiology of hemorrhoidal disease is still largely unknown. Many theories have been proposed, but the most common, and perhaps most accurate, theory pertains to the abnormal sliding of the vascular cushions that is associated with straining and irregular bowel habits. Hard, bulky stools promote straining, which is more likely to push the cushions out of the anal canal. Furthermore, straining may cause engorgement of the cushions during defecation, making their displacement more likely. Congestion and hypertrophy of the anal cushions ensue, making them more prone to developing edema and bleeding.\n [1] \n\n\nIt is useful to classify hemorrhoids as external or internal (see Technical Considerations below).\nSymptoms\nBleeding is the most common presenting symptom of hemorrhoidal disease. It usually manifests as bright red blood, recognized first on the toilet paper with defecation and later becoming heavier and noticed in the toilet. With time, bleeding may be unrelated to defecation.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProlapse of internal hemorrhoids is highly characteristic of more advanced and chronic hemorrhoidal disease. The prolapsed internal hemorrhoids may reduce spontaneously or may need to be reduced manually. In rare cases, they may prolapse through the anal canal and become incarcerated.\n\nIn the absence of thrombosis or incarceration, hemorrhoids are usually painless. Dull pain after defecation is common with prolapsed hemorrhoids and is relieved by reducing the prolapse. If someone is experiencing severe pain, a complication of hemorrhoids or another diagnosis, such as anal fissure, abscess, or rectal ulceration, must be considered.\n [3, 2] \n\nPatients may experience mucoid anal discharge or fecal soilage as internal hemorrhoids prolapse through the anal canal. This irritation of the perianal skin can result in significant pruritus.\n [3] \n\nComplications\nThrombosis is the most painful complication of internal or external hemorrhoids. The pain is often severe enough to affect routine daily activities. While it can occur in large, prolapsed hemorrhoids, thrombosis is more common in external hemorrhoids. If the epithelium overlying the thrombosed hemorrhoid breaks down and allows invasion of bacteria, it may lead to infection, which is rare.\n [2] \n\nThe incidence of hemorrhoidal bleeding that results in anemia is low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Hernia Reduction": "\nBackground\n\n\nA hernia is a protrusion of tissue through a defect in its encapsulating walls. This defect occurs frequently; hernia repair is the most common operation in general surgery.\n [1] \nHernias may be broadly divided into two main groups, depending on whether they develop in the upper abdomen or in the groin (see the image below), and each group contains multiple types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariations of hernia type and location. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nGroin hernias include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Indirect inguinal hernia - Bounded by the inguinal (Hesselbach) triangle, an indirect inguinal hernia passes through the internal inguinal ring; it is the most common hernia type and is more commonly seen in males\n         \n\n\n\n          Direct inguinal hernia - This type is similarly bounded by the inguinal triangle, but it passes directly through the muscular and fascial wall of the abdomen; it carries a minimal risk of incarceration\n         \n\n\n\n          Femoral hernia - Originating below the inguinal ligament, a femoral hernia passes through the transversalis fascia and through the femoral canal; it presents a high risk of incarceration\n          \n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdominal hernias include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Umbilical hernia - This type (see the image below) is seen traversing the fibromuscular ring at the umbilicus; commonly seen in infants, it usually resolves by the age of 5 years; repair is indicated when an umbilical hernia develops in older children or adults, is larger than 2 cm, or is incarcerated\n          \n [3] \n\n\n\n\n          Epigastric hernia - This type is a midline hernia that passes through the linea alba\n         \n\n\n\n          Spigelian hernia - This rare type is located at the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis and passes through the semilunar line\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-year-old man presents with recurrent umbilical hernia, which is reduced in emergency department. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nBefore surgical repair of a hernia, manual reduction can return the tissue to its original compartment.\n [4] Reduction benefits the patient by mitigating associated symptoms, avoiding adverse outcomes such as strangulation, and permitting elective surgical repair, which has lower morbidity than emergency repair.\n [5, 6]  The most common hernias amenable to reduction are described in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Two or more loops of intestine are sutured or stapled together to form a reservoir for stool. This reservoir is then attached to the anus for reestablishment of anal fecal flow. The IPAA is often protected by temporarily diverting the path of stool through the abdominal wall in the form of an upstream ileostomy. After a period of recovery, this ileostomy is reversed during a separate procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Multiple rubber bands can be applied in one session, and further bands can be applied in subsequent sessions if a single session fails to completely eradicate the internal hemorrhoids. The treatment success rate is high, while the long-term recurrence rate is low.\nSymptomatic hemorrhoids in adults is considered one of the most prevalent anorectal disorders. Hemorrhoids of different grades can be found in more than 80-90% of patients undergoing sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\n [2] Hemorrhoids are either internal or external, depending on the localization above or below the dentate line.\n [3] \n\n\nInternal hemorrhoids may be classified into four grades on the basis of the Goligher system, as follows\n [3] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Grade I hemorrhoids protrude into the anal canal but do not prolapse\n         \n\n\n\n          Grade II hemorrhoids prolapse with straining or defecation but reduce spontaneously (see the image below)\n         \n\n\n\n          Grade III hemorrhoids prolapse and usually require manual reduction\n         \n\n\n\n          Grade IV hemorrhoids are prolapsed and cannot be reduced and are thus at risk of strangulation and thrombosis\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade II internal hemorrhoids. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade I, grade II, and select grade III hemorrhoids are managed nonsurgically, whereas grade IV and many grade III hemorrhoids require surgical intervention.\n [4] \n\nStiegman and Goff were the first to propose the technique of elastic band ligation for the treatment of esophageal and gastric varices using a gastroscope,\n [5, 6] and that technique was also applied to treat symptomatic internal hemorrhoids.

        "Intestinal Anastomosis": "\nBackground\n\n\nIntestinal anastomosis is a surgical procedure performed to establish communication between two formerly distant portions of the intestine. This procedure restores intestinal continuity after removal of a pathologic condition affecting the bowel. Intestinal anastomosis is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures, especially in the emergency setting, and is also commonly performed in the elective setting when resections are carried out for benign or malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n\nA disastrous complication of intestinal anastomosis is anastomotic leakage resulting in peritonitis, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Proper surgical technique and adherence to fundamental principles are imperative to ensure successful outcome after intestinal anastomosis.\n\nIntestinal anastomosis can be performed by means of a handsewn technique that uses absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures or by means of stapling. The former is the more commonly used option because of the availability and affordability of suture materials and the wide familiarity with the procedure. The increased availability of stapling devices for intestinal anastomosis has provided an alternative option for performing a rapid anastomosis. Higher cost, limited availability, and less familiarity are the main drawbacks of these devices.\n\nLess common techniques for intestinal anastomosis use compression devices (biofragmentable anastomotic rings), glue (tissue or synthetic), and laser welding.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \n\nNewer techniques include robotic-assisted methods and magnetic compression anastomosis. In an initial case series from the first trial of the Magnamosis magnetic compression anastomosis device in humans, the device was successfully placed and effectively formed a side-to-side anastomosis (which essentially is a functional end-to-end small-bowel anastomosis).\n [5] No leaks were found in the intermediate follow-up period.\n\nAdvances in therapeutic endoscopy have led to the development of minimally invasive techniques that can be performed instead of surgical interventions to create GI anastomoses. Studies have reported the use of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided visceral anastomosis for applications such as bypassing malignant and benign gastric outlet obstruction and relieving pancreatobiliary symptoms in afferent loop syndrome.\n [6] \n\nIntestinal anastomosis in neonatal and pediatric patients may be required for the management of many conditions. Some conditions may necessitate resection of pathology followed by primary anastomosis, whereas other conditions may necessitate delayed anastomosis. Intestinal anastomosis may also be necessary in the management of some nonintestinal anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Adhesiolysis": "\nBackground\n\n\nAdhesions are bands of scar tissue that form between organs. In the abdomen, they form after an abdominal surgery or after a bout of intra-abdominal infection (ie, pelvic inflammatory disease, diverticulitis). More than 95% of patients who undergo abdominal surgery develop adhesions; these are almost inevitably part of the body’s healing process.\n [1, 2, 3] \nAlthough most adhesions are asymptomatic, some can cause bowel obstructions, infertility, and chronic pain. In a study that reviewed over 18,912 patients who underwent previous open abdominal surgery, 14.3% presented with a bowel obstruction in 2 years, with 2.6% of these patients requiring adhesiolysis to relieve the bowel obstruction.\n [4]  Postoperative adhesions account for 74% of cases of small-bowel obstruction.\n [5] \n\n\nLaparotomy with open adhesiolysis has been the treatment of choice for acute complete bowel obstructions. Patients who have partial obstructions, with some enteric contents traversing the obstruction, may also require surgery if nonoperative measures fail. However, operation often leads to formation of new intra-abdominal adhesions in 10-30% of patients, which may necessitate another laparotomy for recurrent bowel obstruction in the future.\n [6, 7, 8] \nLaparoscopic adhesiolysis was first described by a gynecologist for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain and infertility.\n [9]  In the early days of laparoscopy, previous abdominal surgery was a relative contraindication for most laparoscopic procedures. Laparoscopic surgery to relieve bowel obstructions was not routinely performed. However, in 1991, Bastug et al reported the successful use of laparoscopic adhesiolysis for small-bowel obstruction in one patient with a single adhesive band.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nSince then, many case series have documented this technique.\n [9, 11]  Technologic advances in the form of high-definition imaging, smaller cameras, and better instrumentation have allowed an increasing number of adhesiolysis procedures to be performed laparoscopically with good outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nCompared with the open approach to adhesiolysis, the laparoscopic approach offers the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Less postoperative pain\n         \n\n\n\n          Decreased incidence of ventral hernia\n         \n\n\n\n          Reduced recovery time with earlier return of bowel function\n         \n\n\n\n          Shorter hospital stay\n          \n [12, 13] \n\n\n\nIn 2012, a European consensus conference formulated clinical practice guidelines for laparoscopic adhesiolysis, including recommendations for diagnostic assessment, operative timing, patient selection, conversion criteria, equipment, adjunctive agents, and other concerns.\n [14] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Appendectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAcute appendicitis (AA), a common intra-abdominal surgical pathology, requires a comprehensive understanding of its presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and overall operative management.\nIn the United States, the overall incidence of AA is approximately 7%, with a mortality of 0.2-0.8%.\n [1] The morbidity and mortality are related to the presenting stage of disease and are higher in cases of perforation.\n\n\nBriefly, the pathophysiology and progressive timeline of AA are attributed to luminal obstruction, causing distention, ineffective venous and lymphatic drainage, bacterial invasion, and, finally, perforation with associated leakage of contents into the peritoneal cavity.\nThe presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of AA are notoriously inconsistent; many factors attribute to these discrepancies. The classic history consists of anorexia and periumbilical pain, followed by nausea, right-lower-quadrant (RLQ) pain, and vomiting, as well as leukocytosis.\n [2] History and physical examination should provide enough clinical information to diagnose AA, with the use of imaging modalities as adjuncts in the assessment.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment consists of providing aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, placing the patient on nil per os (NPO) status and on pain control, and obtaining a general surgical consultation for definitive operative management (either open or laparoscopic).\n\n\n\n\nThe authors' institution, a residency training facility, primarily uses the laparoscopic approach to AA, as is described in this article.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has rapidly become the procedure of choice for routine gallbladder removal and is currently the most commonly performed major abdominal procedure in Western countries.\n [1] \nA National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus statement in 1992 stated that laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides a safe and effective treatment for most patients with symptomatic gallstones and has become the treatment of choice for many patients.\n [2] This procedure has more or less ended attempts at noninvasive management of gallstones.\n\n\nThe initial driving force behind the rapid development of laparoscopic cholecystectomy was patient demand. Prospective randomized trials were late and largely irrelevant because advantages were clear. Hence, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced and gained acceptance not through organized and carefully conceived clinical trials but through acclamation.\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy decreases postoperative pain, decreases the need for postoperative analgesia, shortens the hospital stay from 1 week to less than 24 hours, and returns the patient to full activity within 1 week (compared with 1 month after open cholecystectomy).\n [3, 4] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy also provides improved cosmesis and improved patient satisfaction as compared with open cholecystectomy.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough direct operating room and recovery room costs are higher for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the shortened length of hospital stay leads to a net savings. More rapid return to normal activity may lead to indirect cost savings.\n [5] Not all such studies have demonstrated a cost savings, however. In fact, with the higher rate of cholecystectomy in the laparoscopic era, the costs in the United States of treating gallstone disease may actually have increased.\n\n\n\n\nTrials have shown that laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients in outpatient settings and those in inpatient settings recover equally well, indicating that a greater proportion of patients should be offered the outpatient modality.\n [6] \n\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy has received nearly universal acceptance and is currently considered the criterion standard for the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis.\n [7, 6] Many centers have special “short-stay” units or “23-hour admissions” for postoperative observation following this procedure.\n [6] \n\nData from all over the world have, however, shown that the risk of a bile duct injury (BDI) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is about 0.5%—that is, about two the three times the risk previously reported for open cholecystectomy.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Bariatric surgery helps patients achieve weight loss through two mechanisms: restriction and malabsorption.\n [1] Laparoscopic gastric banding, described in this article, falls under the subcategory of restrictive bariatric surgery.\nOther forms of bariatric surgery are gastric bypass (see Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass) and sleeve gastrectomy. Currently, laparoscopic gastric banding is not performed as frequently as it once was\n [1] ; nevertheless, many patients still have bands in place, and the procedure may still be useful for selected patients.\n [2, 3] \n\n\nObesity is caused by a combination of genetics, environmental issues, and behavioral factors.\n [4, 5]  Consumption of high-calorie foods, consumption of too much food, and a sedentary lifestyle all work together to create this condition.

The study of laparoscopic colorectal surgery reported by Lujan et al in 2002,\n [2]  more than a century after the original laparoscopic leap, lent credibility to the accuracy of this approach and clarity to the complexity involved.\n\n\nAlthough progress has been slow, several technological milestones have allowed clinicians to apply this significantly less invasive modality to treatment of the most complex pathologic conditions.

The procedure is associated with various risks; thus, knowledge of optimal surgical techniques may facilitate enhanced patient outcomes.\n [1, 2] \nSurgical approaches to LHPR include conventional open surgery, multiport laparoscopic surgery, and single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). The laparoscopic approach offers significant advantages over the open approach in terms of decreased morbidity (eg, surgical-site infection [SSI]\n [3] ) and mortality, reduced duration of postoperative hospitalization, shorter operating time, and more rapid achievement of normal bowel function.\n [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]  A combined transanal-laparoscopic approach to LHPR has also been described, but further study will be required to determine its utility.\n [8, 9] \n\n\nAdvances in medical science have also led to the performance of robotic Hartmann procedures in various centers.

        "Laparoscopic Incisional Hernia Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nA hernia is the protrusion of tissue or part of an organ through the bone, muscular tissue, or the membrane by which it is normally contained. Hernias can be classified as internal or external and as abdominal or thoracic.\nAbdominal wall hernias can occur spontaneously (presumably from congenital defects) or after surgery. When they occur after surgery, they are called incisional hernias, which can range from small defects to extremely large ones. Some defects are so large that contents are irreducible owing to an abdominal wall that is chronically injured and reduced. This is referred to as “loss of domain.\"\n\n\nIncisional hernias are very common: They are the second most common type of hernia after inguinal hernias. Approximately 4 million laparotomies are performed in the United States annually, 2-30% of them resulting in incisional hernia.\n [1] Between 100,000 and 150,000 ventral incisional hernia repairs are performed annually in the United States.\n [2] \nIncisional hernias after laparotomy are mostly related to failure of the fascia to heal and involve technical and biologic factors.\n [3] Approximately 50% of all incisional hernias develop or present within the first 2 years following surgery, and 74% occur within 3 years.\n [4, 5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nDepending on size, the repair of an incisional hernia varies from simple suturing to major reconstruction of the abdominal wall with creation of muscle flaps and the use of large pieces of mesh. This can be done with an open approach or laparoscopy.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1993, LeBlanc reported the first case of laparoscopic incisional hernia repair with the use of synthetic mesh.\n [7]  The procedure involves the placement of a mesh inside the abdomen without abdominal wall reconstruction. The mesh is fixed with sutures, staples, or tacks. The recurrence rate of laparoscopic repair is reported as equal to or less than that of open repair. Incisional hernia repair is considered a challenging procedure, especially with recurrent hernias, in which the chances of failure increase with each surgical attempt.\n [8, 9] \n\nIn an analysis of data from the Herniamed Registry on 61,627 patients who underwent incisional hernia repair between 2010 and 2019, Köckerling et al showed that the proportion of laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repairs decreased significantly between 2013 and 2015.\n [10] From 2015 onward, various minimally invasive techniques (eg, endoscopically assisted/miniopen sublay operation [E/MILOS], extended totally extraperitoneal repair [eTEP],\n [11] and preperitoneal mesh technique) were increasingly used.\n\nGuidelines regarding laparoscopic treatment of incisional hernias have been published by the International Endohernia Society (IEHS).\n [12, 13] \n\nRisk factors for hernia formation\nA 0.1% rate of acute laparotomy wound failure has been reported in the literature.\n [14] The true rate of laparotomy failure is about 11%; of these patients, 94% present with recurrence in the first 3 years after the operation.\n [3] The real laparotomy wound failure rate is therefore 100 times greater than was previously thought. The early mechanical failure, therefore, occurs early in the course of the disease, and the healing skin conceals a myofascial defect that enlarges or appears later.\n\nPerioperative shock is a recognized risk factor for incisional hernia formation.\n [15] \n\nUpper-midline incisions have a higher incidence of hernia formation than other types of incision do.\n [16, 17] \n\nTechnique is a factor as well. The configuration of the collagen bundles of the abdominal wall is oriented transversely; therefore, a transverse suture line is mechanically more stable, in that it encircles the fibers rather than splitting them.\n [18] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nLaparoscopic inguinal hernia repair originated in the early 1990s as laparoscopy gained a foothold in general surgery.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Inguinal hernias account for 75% of all abdominal wall hernias, and with a lifetime risk of 27% in men and 3% in women. Repair of these hernias is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the world.\n [6] In the United States, approximately 800,000 inguinal herniorrhaphies are performed annually.\n [7] \nAlthough open, mesh-based, tension-free repair remains the criterion standard, laparoscopic herniorrhaphy, in the hands of adequately trained surgeons, produces excellent results comparable to those of open repair.\n [8, 9] In a comparison between open repair and laparoscopic repair, Eklund et al found that 5 years after operation, 1.9% of patients who had undergone laparoscopic repair continued to report moderate or severe pain, compared with 3.5% of those who had undergone open repair.\n [10] \n\n\nA number of studies have shown laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias to have advantages over conventional repair, including the following\n [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Reduced postoperative pain\n         \n\n\n\n          Diminished requirement for narcotics\n         \n\n\n\n          Earlier return to work\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nLaparoscopic repair has some disadvantages as well, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Increased cost\n         \n\n\n\n          Lengthier operation\n         \n\n\n\n          Steeper learning curve\n         \n\n\n\n          Higher recurrence and complication rates early in a surgeon’s experience\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nThe term laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy can refer to any of the following three techniques:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair\n         \n\n\n\n          Transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair\n         \n\n\n\n          Intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair\n          \n [16, 17, 18, 19] \n\n\n\nThe IPOM repair has largely fallen from favor, and currently, the most commonly performed laparoscopic techniques are the TEP and TAPP repairs.\n [14, 15, 8] Although many facets of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair continue to be debated—such as the possible superiority of one laparoscopic approach to another, comparisons between laparoscopic and open surgery, the learning curve and training issues, and the socioeconomic implications—both TAPP and TEP have been shown to be acceptable and safe for repair of inguinal hernias.\n\nFor information on manual reduction of hernias, see Hernia Reduction. For a discussion of open repair, see Open Inguinal Hernia Repair.\n\nAlthough robot-assisted laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is becoming popular, it is not yet widely available and is not extensively performed by surgical residents. A scoping review on the involvement of surgical specialists and surgical residents (nonspecialists) in robot-assisted groin hernia repair was carried out by Hansen et al.\n [20] According to this report, the hernia repair was performed by a surgical specialist in 85% of the 67 studies included, and the procedure was attended by a resident in only 13% of the studies. The authors suggested that this technique was being underutilized in the education of surgical residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Left Adrenalectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nLaparoscopic left adrenalectomy is a procedure in which the left adrenal gland is surgically removed. Adrenalectomy has undergone a significant transformation since the first report of a laparoscopic adrenalectomy was published in 1992.\n [1]  There has been a paradigm shift from open to laparoscopic approaches for both malignant and benign adrenal pathologies. The ascent of laparoscopy in adrenal surgery has been championed by numerous studies demonstrating decreased blood loss, shorter hospital stays, shorter convalescence, and diminished patient morbidity with laparoscopic surgery as compared with open surgery.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \nThe advance of laparoscopy has led to a surgical revolution that enabled surgeons to treat adrenal pathologies with decreased morbidity and offered patients the added benefit of an abbreviated convalescence. The use of laparoscopy in adrenal surgery is currently the standard of care, and many new surgical approaches are being actively developed. Meticulous surgical dissection and increasing surgeon experience will help maintain the current low complication rates.\n\n\nAlong with the popularization of laparoscopic adrenalectomy, there has been a surge in adrenal surgery overall. This is in part due to the identification of adrenal lesions on radiographic studies performed for unrelated indications (adrenal “incidentalomas”). Whereas patients with adrenal pathology previously presented with symptomatic disease, the diagnosis is now most commonly made after an adrenal lesion is diagnosed via computed tomography (CT). It is estimated that adrenal lesions are found in as many as 5% of CT scans obtained for unrelated indications.\n [8]  As a result of this increase in detection, the number of adrenalectomies increased 43% between 1988 and 2000.\n [9, 10] \nSurgery is by no means indicated for all adrenal lesions. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes benign nonfunctional adenoma, functional adenoma, pheochromocytoma, myelolipoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and metastatic lesions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Left Colectomy (Left Hemicolectomy)": "\nBackground\n\n\nMost gastrointestinal (GI) surgeons now accept that laparoscopic surgery for both benign and malignant diseases of the colon is within the mainstream of patient care and that it results in superior clinical outcomes (eg, shorter hospital stay, less surgical-site discomfort, and quicker return to normal activity) as compared with open surgery (OS).\n [1, 2, 3] Laparoscopy has been associated with a lower incidence of both surgical-site infections (SSIs)\n [4, 5] and hernias\n [6] and with greater patient satisfaction as compared with laparotomy.\n [7, 8] \nAlthough concerns regarding recurrence and survival rates associated with laparoscopic colon cancer resections initially dampened enthusiasm for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in this setting, subsequent clinical studies established that properly performed laparoscopies produce comparable colon cancer outcomes comparable to those of OS, as well as improved clinical results.\n [9, 10] \n\n\nThe prolonged operating time was one of the concerns with minimally invasive left colectomy. In a study aimed at addressing this concern, Sweigert et al examined overall morbidity, SSI rate, and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing laparoscopic left colectomy compared with those undergoing open left colectomy.\n [11] Despite the longer operating time, laparoscopic left colectomy was associated with lower risk-adjusted rates of overall morbidity and SSI and shorter hospital stays. The laparoscopic left colectomy group also had lower rates of composite 30-day death or serious morbidity.\nA “division of labor” has occurred within the field of MIS techniques, which has shaped a number of innovations that include robotic assistance,\n [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] more reliable energy devices, endostaplers, and a motivation to reduce the number of access sites (even to the point of limiting surgical access to a single port).\n\n\n\n\nThe optimal procedure for transverse colon cancer remains controversial, in that there is uncertainty over radical lymph node dissection. In a study of 252 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for transverse colon cancer, Fukuoka et al found that laparoscopic surgery led to an optimum radical lymph node dissection for transverse colon cancer.\n [17] ​ Lymph nodal metastasis was reported to be an independent risk factor for relapse-free survival.\n\n\n\n\nSplenic flexure colon cancer, though a rare disease that accounts for only 2-8% of colorectal cancers, can have a good outcome following segmental resection.\n [18] Laparoscopic segmental left colectomy can be an option for such tumors, in addition to conventional anterior resection.\n\nIn the United States, despite the advantages afforded to patients by laparoscopy, the adoption of these techniques in the general population is still limited to a minority, though the proportion has been growing.\n [19] Much of the reluctance to implement laparoscopic techniques has been related to the technical challenge posed by complex laparoscopic procedures such as colon resections. The following article describes the fundamental aspects involved in approaching a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy (left colectomy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication": "\nBackground\n\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is now considered the standard surgical approach for treatment of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n [1] GERD is increasingly prevalent and costly, and it may affect as much as 20% of the US population.\n [2] \nThe pathophysiology of GERD is due not to acid overproduction but, rather, to mechanical dysfunction centered around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Furthermore, the mainstay of GERD treatment, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have come under scrutiny because of worrisome side effects.\n [3, 4] Laparoscopic magnetic sphincter augmentation of the LES has been proposed as an additional surgical option. Like Nissen fundoplication, it relies on 360° buttressing of the LES, but it may cause fewer long-term adverse effects.\n [5, 6] \n\n\nDr Rudolf Nissen (1896-1981) described the first fundoplication in the 1950s for treatment of severe reflux esophagitis. His original procedure used a 360° wrap of the fundus of the stomach around the esophagus by plication of both the anterior and posterior walls of the gastric fundus around the lesser curvature. Although the standard Nissen fundoplication has been modified many times, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is now considered the standard surgical approach for treatment of GERD.\n [1] \nThere has been considerable debate about the relative efficacies of antireflux surgery and medical treatment. A systematic review concluded that the two treatment approaches were of similar efficacy.\n [7] Some of the literature has suggested that long-term outcomes from antireflux surgery may be superior to those of medical treatment.\n [8, 9]  In appropriately selected patients, laparoscopic reflux surgery may be more cost-effective than lifelong medical treatment.\n [10, 11] \n\n\n\n\nThe 2022 guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG)\n [12]  stated that \"modern medical antireflux therapy and laparoscopic fundoplication seem to have similar efficacy in healing the symptoms and endoscopic signs of GERD.... Clearly, antireflux surgery is not a permanent cure for GERD in all patients as it was once touted to be, and the operation occasionally can have severe adverse effects. Nevertheless, most patients obtain long-term benefit from fundoplication, and patient satisfaction with successful surgery seems to be greater than that for chronic medical therapy.\"\n\n\n\n\nLaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication may have advantages over the traditional open approach, including improved cosmesis, reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stay, decreased respiratory complications, and faster recovery.\n [13, 14, 15] ; however, it may also be associated with longer operating times.\n [14] With respect to subjective symptoms, long-term outcomes after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication are comparable to those after open surgery.\n [16, 17, 18] Currently, the laparoscopic approach is favored over an open approach unless it is specifically contraindicated.\n\nRobotic-assisted fundoplication was developed as a minimally invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopic fundoplication. A long-term (12 y) study by Lang et al found no significant differences between the two approaches with respect to postoperative symptoms, quality of life, or treatment failure; both were associated with a high rate of patient satisfaction.\n [19] \n\nA transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) procedure has been developed\n [20]  and is considered to be an acceptable option in selected patients\n [21] ; however, it has not been shown to be superior to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\n [22] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Since the first description of laparoscopic adrenalectomy by Gagner et al in 1992,\n [1]  this approach has become increasingly used. It is now the technique of choice for most benign adrenal lesions because of the decreased blood loss, lower morbidity, shorter hospitalization, faster recovery, and overall cost-effectiveness in comparison with the open approach.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] \nBecause of the anatomic differences between right and left adrenal glands—most notably, different venous drainage patterns—surgical approaches are different for right and left adrenalectomy. Although laparoscopic right adrenalectomy is generally believed to be more difficult because of the proximity of dissection to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and duodenum and the short adrenal vein, one review comparing laparoscopic left and right adrenalectomies reported no differences in complication or conversion rates, with shorter operating times for the right.\n [12]  One study found the risk of bleeding to be comparable for the two procedures, except in cases of pheochromocytoma, metastasis, or masses larger than 5 cm.\n [13] \n\n\nNevertheless, surgeons must recognize that technical strategies and anatomy differ between laparoscopic right and left adrenalectomies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Nonetheless, even though the first laparoscopic colectomy was reported decades ago, the majority of colectomies in the United States are still being performed via the open approach.\nThis delay in acceptance has mainly been attributable to initial concerns regarding the adequacy of oncologic margins and trocar site recurrences believed to occur with laparoscopy—concerns now largely laid to rest by the results of large randomized controlled trials such as the Clinical Outcomes of Surgical Therapy (COST) trial.\n [1]  Minimally invasive colectomy has been growing in popularity.\n [2] \n\n\nThe benefits of laparoscopic hemicolectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Smaller wounds and improved cosmesis\n         \n\n\n\n          Shorter hospital stay\n         \n\n\n\n          Less postoperative pain\n         \n\n\n\n          Earlier return to normal activity\n         \n\n\n\n          Quicker recovery of pulmonary function\n         \n\n\n\n          Lower incidence and quicker resolution of postoperative ileus\n         \n\n\n\n          Lower incidence of surgical site complications\n         \n\n\n\n          Lower incidence of postoperative adhesions\n          \n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goals of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (right colectomy) performed in the setting of colon cancer are the same as those of the equivalent open procedure. They involve appropriate vessel ligation, creation of sufficient luminal margins, and adequate lymph node sampling. In addition, a thorough inspection of the abdominal cavity and liver surface is expected, together with the creation of a reliable anastomosis.\n\n\n\n\nLaparoscopic colectomy for resectable colon cancer has been reported to be technically and oncologically feasible. The general consensus, based on the literature over the past several years, is that there is no significant difference in lymph node harvest between laparoscopic and open right hemicolectomies for cancer when strict oncologic principles of resection are followed. To date, patient survival, disease progression, and cancer recurrence at port sites have been found to be equivalent between laparoscopic colectomy and traditional open colectomy.\n\nSeveral short-term benefits similar to those described for colon cancer have been associated with laparoscopic segmental colon resection for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, theoretical long-term advantages include formation of fewer adhesions, decreased rates of bowel obstruction, decreased likelihood of chronic pain, and decreased incidence of infertility or wound hernias. Two randomized controlled trials demonstrated some short-term benefits to laparoscopic ileocolic resection for Crohn disease. On the other hand, evidence on laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis has not supported its routine use among nonexpert surgeons outside of specialized centers.\n\nLaparoscopic colonic resection for diverticular disease appears to provide several short-term benefits, though these advantages may not translate to cases of complicated diverticulitis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Longitudinal Pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow Procedure)": "\nBackground\n\n\nChronic pancreatitis is characterized by progressive pancreatic fibrosis and loss of endocrine and exocrine function. The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is pain, which can be severe and intractable in some patients. Although it is itself benign, chronic pancreatitis can significantly affect quality of life and can cause significant distress with its attendant complications.\n [1] \nThe initial treatment for pain in most cases is nonoperative, consisting of enzyme replacement, control of diabetes with insulin, and administration of oral analgesics.\n\n\nSurgical intervention is required in patients with intractable pain that is resistant to conventional nonsurgical therapy, in patients with associated or suspected malignancy, and in patients who have developed complications such as biliary or duodenal obstruction, pancreatic fistulae, pancreatic ascites/pleural effusion, pseudocysts, or hemosuccus pancreaticus.\n [2] \nThe etiology of pain in chronic pancreatitis is unclear. It often precedes any loss of endocrine or exocrine function and any radiographically demonstrable changes in the pancreas. Some evidence has suggested that perineural inflammation may be the cause of pain. A dilated pancreatic duct, secondary to obstruction, may cause increased intraductal pressures, resulting in pain.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nThe primary aim of therapy is the achievement of primary pain relief and an improvement in quality of life. This could be achieved by means of surgery, endotherapy, or other treatment modalities.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nHistorical perspective of surgical management\nGould successfully removed calculi from the Wirsung duct in 1898.\n [5] \n\nMoynihan in 1902\n [6] and subsequently Mayo-Robson in 1908\n [7] reported that timely removal of calculi from the pancreatic duct prevented atrophy of the pancreas and relieved pain.\n\nCoffey first performed distal pancreatectomy with pancreaticoenterostomy in dogs. He suggested that this procedure may be beneficial in various conditions.\n [8] \n\nLink reported the first pancreatic duct drainage operation for chronic pancreatitis as early as 1911. In this procedure, a catheter was placed in the pancreatic duct to drain the pancreatic juice through the skin, providing pain relief and restoring the patient’s normal weight.\n [9] \n\nTwo procedures were developed in the 1950s. Duval reported on distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and pancreaticojejunostomy in 1954.\n [10] In this procedure, an end-to-end distal pancreaticojejunostomy was performed, and the pancreatic duct was decompressed in a retrograde manner. The disadvantage of this procedure was that if the ductal system contained strictures, the entire duct would not be decompressed.\n\nIn 1958, Puestow and Gillesby introduced the lateral (longitudinal) pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ), which consists of a longitudinal incision of the pancreatic duct and implantation of the tail of the gland into the Roux-en-Y limb of the jejunum following splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy.\n [11] Although this procedure decompressed a greater length of pancreatic duct and was useful in patients with strictures in the main pancreatic duct, it involved splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy and did not satisfactorily decompress the pancreatic head and the uncinate ducts.\n\nIn 1963, Partington and Rochelle modified the Puestow-Gillesby pancreaticojejunostomy by creating an anastomosis between a longitudinally incised anterior surface of the pancreas and duct with a longitudinally incised Roux-en-Y jejunal loop.\n [12] This modification did not require distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, or mobilization of the pancreas from its retroperitoneal attachments. Anastomosis to the opened anterior surface of the pancreas and duct allowed decompression of the pancreatic duct from the head to the tail of the pancreas.\n\nManagement goals\nThe two primary goals in treating chronic pancreatitis are long-term pain relief and improved quality of life, which can now be achieved  with advances in surgical technique in the form of laparoscopic or robotic lateral pancreaticojejunostomy.\n [13]  Kirks et al, in a study comparing the clinical and cost outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic (RAL) LPJ with those of open LPJ for chronic pancreatitis, found that RAL LPJ shortened hospitalization and reduced medication costs, though overall hospitalization costs were equivalent.\n [14] \n\nIn children, LPJ is one of the surgical options for the managment of chronic pancreatitis, apart from resectional surgery.\n [15]  To date, however, it has not been as frequently performed in children as in adults.\n [16] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Omentoplasty": "\nBackground\n\n\nOmentoplasty is a surgical procedure in which part of the greater omentum is used to cover or fill a defect, augment arterial or portal venous circulation, absorb effusions, or increase lymphatic drainage. The omentum has been described as the \"policeman of the abdomen,\" in that it wraps around abdominal structures such as the gallbladder and appendix and can revascularize them when they are deprived of their blood supply. Omentoplasty may be classified into the following two types\n [1] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Type I – Single-layered omentum\n         \n\n\n\n          Type II – Double-layered omentum\n         \n\n\n\nWhen Casten and Alday introduced omental transposition for treatment of patients with atherosclerosis,\n [2] they believed that it worked by supplying extra blood to the ischemic limb. However, this explanation is implausible because the diameter of the omental vessels is roughly one tenth that of the popliteal artery. Later studies demonstrated that an increase in local collateral circulation (rather than any significant increase in blood flow) was the likely mechanism of action for omental transfer.\n [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \nGoldsmith et al showed that the omentum contains a lipid fraction that promotes neovascularization; thus, a local effect on limb musculature with increased local collateral circulation may be a possible mode of action.\n [8, 9] \n\n\n\n\nOmentum is known to adhere to surrounding structures and develop connections with them. Hoshino et al observed vascular connections between the omentum and the limb vasculature in limbs that had been amputated after omental transplantation.\n [1] Babu et al noted revascularization of muscle from omental vessels growing into it in limbs that had been amputated after omental transplantation.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nAgarwal et al performed postoperative angiography in 50 patients who underwent omental grafting; they observed a greater number of collateral vessels at the graft site, with filling of vessels distal to the block in the limbs.\n [11] \n\nIn an extension of the same study, 20 dogs underwent allograft omental transfer in limbs after ligation of the femoral artery. In 10 cases, exploration of the graft site after 3 weeks revealed an increased number of collateral vessels at the graft site, with filling of vessels distal to the site of the block. The authors' conclusion stated that even an omental graft that is mismatched with respect to blood group and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is taken up and revascularizes the ischemic limb.\n [11] \n\nSubodh et al used postoperative Doppler studies and selective celiac axis angiography to study the circulation in the omental graft and found that in 18 of 20 cases, the arterial pulsations were heard up to the knee on Doppler study; in the other two cases, symptoms did not improve.\n [12]  On celiac axis angiography, however, the omental vessels could be visualized up to the thigh in only six patients and up to the knee in only four. The authors concluded that omental transposition probably works by promoting local collateralization; similar conclusions were drawn in another study comparing free omental grafts to pedicled omental grafts.\n\nThree randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2296 participants concluded that omentoplasty for esophagogastrostomy after esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer may decrease anastomotic leakage without affecting the rate of other complications.\n [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

It is estimated that intra-abdominal adhesions develop in 90-95% of patients after surgery.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \nThe underlying mechanism of adhesion formation involves injury to the peritoneal epithelium resulting in fibrin matrix deposition to the injured intra-abdominal surfaces. Fibrinolysis by plasmin is typically inadequate in the postoperative period, and the nondegraded deposits lead to adhesion formation.\n [5]  Congenital causes of adhesions (eg, Ladd bands) exist but represent only a small minority of cases.\n\n\nThe morbidity from adhesions can range from chronic abdominal pain to female infertility.\n [1, 8]  The most common of these conditions is partial or complete intestinal obstruction, for which the small bowel is the most common location. Postoperative adhesions account for as many as 79% of acute intestinal obstructions.\n [2] \nThe spectrum of treatments for small-bowel obstruction ranges from conservative management with bowel rest to surgical intervention, sometimes involving bowel resection. Nonsurgical treatments have been used\n [9]  include anti-inflammatory agents, synthetic inert solid barriers, and fibrinolytic agents. However, none of these treatments has proved uniformly effective under all circumstances.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nThe general view has been that surgical adhesiolysis should be performed promptly for patients for whom surgery is clearly indicated but should be reserved for those patients who do not respond satisfactorily to nonsurgical treatment. Although conservative treatment often suffices, there is evidence to suggest that early surgical treatment (ie, on either the calendar day of admission or the calendar day after admission) during the first episode of adhesive small-bowel obstruction can be highly effective.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nThe traditional caveat with regard to surgical treatment is that whereas surgery may be required to release symptomatic adhesions, postoperative reformation of these adhesions is common. There has been debate as to whether laparoscopic adhesiolysis yields added benefit in terms of decreasing postoperative adhesion reformation; however, good results have been obtained with this approach.\n [11, 12, 13, 14] \n\nA systematic review by Srinivasan et al (10 studies; N = 36,178) questioned the view that surgery increases the risk for recurrence of adhesive small-bowel obstruction and suggested that this view is outdated.\n [15]  They found operative management to be associated with a lower risk of recurrence than conservative management, while finding no clear difference in recurrence rates between laparoscopic and open adhesiolysis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Through the early to mid-1900s, multiple changes in surgical approaches to the adrenal (suprarenal) gland were developed to augment several posterior and anterior approaches. For decades, little change to adrenal surgery was seen, until the first laparoscopic adrenalectomy was described by Gagner in 1992.\n [5] \n\n\nIncreasing use of imaging technologies, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for aid in diagnosis of other conditions has led to increased diagnosis of adrenal masses.\nThe incidence of these incidentally noted adrenal masses has been estimated to be around 5%.\n [6, 7, 8, 4, 9] Autopsy studies have supported this estimation, showing the incidence of adrenal masses found at autopsy also to be in the range of 3-5%.\n [7, 4, 10] Furthermore, studies of hospital discharges showed a 43.4% increase in adrenalectomy rates from 1988 to 2000.\n [9, 11] With increasing diagnosis and treatment of adrenal masses, optimization of cure and minimization of morbidity become particularly important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Rectal prolapse is defined as a protrusion of the rectum; complete or full-thickness rectal prolapse is also known as procidentia.\nThe underlying pathophysiology is complex, and the etiology is multifactorial. Chronic constipation, female sex, multiple pregnancies, previous pelvic surgery, pelvic floor disorders, and neurologic disorders are predisposing factors for rectal prolapse. Associated anatomic findings include a deep cul-de-sac (rectouterine or rectovesical) pouch, weak lateral rectal attachments, laxity of the levator ani, and weakness of the internal and external anal sphincter, which may be associated with pudendal nerve dysfunction.\n\n\nThree types of rectal prolapse are recognized, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Complete (or full-thickness) rectal prolapse - Protrusion of all the layers of rectal wall through the anal canal\n         \n\n\n\n          Mucosal (or partial-thickness) rectal prolapse - Protrusion of only the mucosal layer of the rectum through the anal canal\n         \n\n\n\n          Internal rectal prolapse - Intussusception of the rectum into the anal canal without protrusion to the exterior\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, the term rectal prolapse should be understood as referring to complete rectal prolapse.\n\n\n\n\nMedical management has no role in the treatment of rectal prolapse.

        "Open Appendectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAcute appendicitis (AA), a common intra-abdominal surgical pathology, requires a comprehensive understanding of its presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and overall operative management. In the United States, the annual incidence of AA is approximately 9.4 per 10,000 population,\n [1] with a mortality of 0.2-0.8%.\n [2]  The morbidity and mortality are related to the presenting stage of the disease and are substantially higher in cases of perforation.\nBriefly, the pathophysiology and progressive timeline of AA are attributed to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Luminal obstruction causing distention\n         \n\n\n\n          Ineffective venous and lymphatic drainage\n         \n\n\n\n          Bacterial invasion\n         \n\n\n\n          Perforation with associated leakage of contents into the peritoneal cavity\n         \n\n\n\nThe presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of AA are notoriously inconsistent, with a multitude of factors contributing to these discrepancies. The classic history consists of anorexia and periumbilical pain, followed by nausea, right-lower-quadrant (RLQ) pain, and vomiting, as well as leukocytosis.\n [3]  The history and physical examination should provide enough clinical information to diagnose AA, with the use of imaging modalities as adjuncts in the assessment.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment consists of providing aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, placing the patient on nil per os (NPO) status, providing pain control, and obtaining a general surgical consultation for definitive operative management. Increasing evidence suggests that in many patients with uncomplicated acute AA, antibiotic therapy may be as effective as surgical treatment.\n [4, 5]  Endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy (ERAT) also appears to be a promising noninvasive treatment modality for uncomplicated AA.\n [6]  \nThe operative approach to AA consists of appendectomy (surgical removal of the vermiform appendix); however, the choice between an open and a laparoscopic operation continues to be debated in the medical literature.\n [7, 8, 9]  The RLQ incision of open appendectomy has persisted essentially unchanged since it was pioneered by McBurney in the 19th century.\n [10]  The use of laparoscopy in the surgical management of AA was first described in 1983, and there is an ongoing trend toward increased use of this approach.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nAs with other laparoscopic surgical procedures, the literature describes decreased pain, earlier resumption of diet, and decreased length of hospital stay for laparoscopic appendectomy versus the equivalent open procedure.\n [9, 12, 13]  However, this must be objectively considered in the light of the current state of the open procedure, which already engenders minimal risk and is associated with an extremely short hospital stay and a low complication rate. Additional disadvantages of laparoscopy include increased cost and longer operating times.\n\nThe authors' institution, a residency training facility, uses the laparoscopic approach to AA (as do most US facilities), but surgeons must continue to understand and be capable of successfully performing open appendectomy.

These were considered extensive, and in 1918, De Brune Groenveldt and Zaaijer described the single incision known today. This transabdominal approach remained the criterion standard in Europe until it was superseded by minimally invasive techniques.\n [2] \nIn North America, however, the Heller myotomy approach of choice was via a left thoracotomy after being described in this way by Ellis et al in 1958. Traditionally, no associated antireflux procedure was performed. The transabdominal approach is now the most common way of performing an open Heller myotomy.\n\n\nPneumatic dilation, with its 2% risk of perforation, was historically the first choice for achalasia treatment, with surgery reserved for failures. Calcium-channel blockers and long-acting nitrates have been attempted as medical therapy to reduce lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone but are relatively short-acting, do not improve LES relaxation in response to swallowing, have significant side effects (eg, headache), and have little overall success.

        "Open Inguinal Hernia Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nHernias are abnormal protrusions of a viscus (or part of it) through a normal or abnormal opening in a cavity (usually the abdomen). They are most commonly seen in the groin; a minority are paraumbilical or incisional. In the groin, inguinal hernias are more common than femoral hernias.\n\nInguinal hernias occur in about 15% of the adult population, and inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the world.\n [1] Approximately 800,000 mesh hernioplasties are performed each year in the United States,\n [2] 100,000 in France, and 80,000 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThere is morphologic and biochemical evidence that adult male inguinal hernias are associated with an altered ratio of type I to type III collagen.\n [3] These changes lead to weakening of the fibroconnective tissue of the groin and development of inguinal hernias. Recognition of this process led to acknowledgment of the need for prosthetic reinforcement of weakened abdominal wall tissue.\n\nGiven the evidence that the use of mesh lowers the recurrence rate,\n [4, 5] as well as the availability of various prosthetic meshes for the reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, most surgeons now prefer to perform a tension-free mesh repair. Accordingly, this article focuses primarily on the Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty, which is one of the most popular techniques used for inguinal hernia repair.\n [6, 7] \n\nTypes of hernia\nAn indirect hernia is defined as a defect protruding through the internal or deep inguinal ring, whereas a direct hernia is a defect protruding through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. To put it in a more anatomic way, an indirect hernia is lateral to the inferior epigastric artery and vein, whereas a direct hernia is medial to these vessels. The Hesselbach triangle is the zone of the inguinal floor through which direct hernias protrude, and its boundaries are the epigastric vessels laterally, the rectus sheath medially, and the inguinal ligament inferiorly.\n [8] \n\nAn incomplete hernia is confined to the inguinal canal, whereas a complete hernia comes out of the inguinal canal through the external or superficial ring into the scrotum. Direct hernias are always incomplete, whereas indirect hernias can also be complete.\n\nA sliding inguinal hernia is one in which a portion of the wall of the hernia sac is made up of an intra-abdominal organ. As the peritoneum is stretched and pushed through the hernia defect and becomes the hernia sac, retroperitoneal structures such as the colon or bladder are dragged along with it and thus come to make up one of its walls.\n\nBilateral pediatric hernias are most commonly indirect hernias and arise because of the patency of the processus vaginalis. Simple ligation of the hernia sac (herniotomy) alone is enough. Surgical treatment of indirect hernias in adults, unlike that in children, requires more than simple ligation of the hernia sac. This is because the patent processus is only part of the story. With time, the internal ring dilates, leaving an adult with what can be a sizable defect in the floor of the inguinal canal; this must be closed in addition to division or reduction of the indirect hernia sac.\n\nA hydrocele is a commonly encountered pathology related to hernias. A communicating hydrocele is, by definition, a form of indirect hernia, albeit with an extremely small defect through which only peritoneal fluid enters the sac but no viscus (eg, omentum or bowel) comes out.\n\nTypes of hernia repair\nInguinal hernia repairs may be divided into the following three general types:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Herniotomy (removal of the hernial sac only) - This, by itself, is adequate for an indirect inguinal hernia in children in whom the abdominal wall muscles are normal; formal repair of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is not required\n         \n\n\n\n          Herniorrhaphy (herniotomy plus repair of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal) - This may be suitable for a small hernia in a young adult with good abdominal wall musculature; the Bassini and Shouldice repairs are examples of herniorrhaphy\n         \n\n\n\n          Hernioplasty (herniotomy plus reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal with a synthetic mesh) - This is required for large hernias and hernias in middle-aged and elderly patients with poor abdominal wall musculature; the Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair is an example of hernioplasty\n         \n\n\nOpen vs laparoscopic repair\nAlthough numerous surgical approaches have been developed to treat inguinal hernias, the Lichtenstein tension-free mesh-based repair remains the criterion standard.\n [1] In a Cochrane review comparing mesh with nonmesh open repair, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that the use of mesh was associated with a reduced rate of recurrence.\n [2] \n\nLaparoscopic approaches are feasible in expert hands, but the learning curve for laparoscopic hernia repair is long (200-250 cases), the severity of complications is greater, detailed analyses of cost-effectiveness are lacking, and long-term recurrence rates have not been determined.\n [9] The role of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in the treatment of an uncomplicated, unilateral hernia is yet to be resolved.\n\nNevertheless, transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) or totally extraperitoneal (TEP) laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty may offer specific benefits for some patients, such as those with recurrent hernia after conventional anterior open hernioplasty, those with bilateral hernias, and those undergoing laparoscopy for other clean operative procedures.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis of seven studies comparing laparoscopic repair with the Lichtenstein technique for treatment of recurrent inguinal hernia concluded that despite the advantages to be expected with the former (eg, reduced pain and earlier return to normal activities), operating time was significantly longer with the minimally invasive technique, and the choice between the two approaches depended largely on the availability of local expertise.\n [10] \n\nFor further details on the debate over laparoscopic versus open repair, see Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair.

The spleen is one of the most frequently injured intraperitoneal organs, and management of splenic injuries may require splenectomy or, rarely, splenorrhaphy.\nThe spleen is a wedge-shaped organ that lies in relation to the ninth and 11th ribs, located in the left hypochondrium and partly in the epigastrium; thus, it is situated between the fundus of the stomach and the diaphragm. The spleen is highly vascular and reddish purple; its size and weight are variable. A normal spleen is not palpable. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Spleen Anatomy.\n\n\nThe spleen's key function is the removal of old red blood cells (RBCs), defective circulating cells, and circulating bacteria. In addition, the spleen helps maintain normal erythrocyte morphology by processing immature erythrocytes, removing their nuclei, and changing the shape of the cellular membrane. Other functions of the spleen include the removal of nuclear remnants of RBCs, denatured hemoglobin, and iron granules and the manufacture of opsonins (properdin and tuftsin).\nThe current trends are toward nonoperative management of the spleen after trauma\n [1, 2] and toward laparoscopic splenectomy for hematologic disorders.\n [3, 4]  Today, most elective splenectomies are done laparoscopically, except in the case of severe splenomegaly.\n [5] Even in the setting of massive splenomegaly, there is evidence to suggest that the laparoscopic approach is safe and feasible.\n [6, 7, 8, 9] However, the benefits of laparoscopic splenectomy vis-a-vis open splenectomy in the setting of splenomegaly have not been definitively established.\n [10, 11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is reserved for chronic pancreatitis, proven benign pancreatic lesions and cysts, neuroendocrine tumors, and trauma.\n\n\nLesions in the body and tail of the pancreas become symptomatic as they enlarge and invade surrounding structures. However, with the increasing use of imaging studies, more incidental pancreatic lesions are discovered and diagnosed. Smaller lesions diagnosed at earlier stages are more amenable to surgical treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Paracentesis": "\nBackground\n\n\nParacentesis is a procedure in which a needle or catheter is inserted into the peritoneal cavity to obtain ascitic fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.\n [1, 2, 3] Ascitic fluid may be used to help determine the etiology of ascites, as well as to evaluate for infection or presence of cancer. With regard to differentiation of transudate from exudate, the preferred means for characterizing ascites is the serum-ascitic albumin gradient (SAAG).\n [4] \nThe SAAG is calculated by subtracting the albumin concentration of the ascitic fluid from the albumin concentration of a serum specimen obtained on the same day. The SAAG correlates directly with portal pressure. Transudative ascites occurs when a patient's SAAG level is greater than or equal to 1.1 g/dL (portal hypertension). Exudative ascites occurs when patients have SAAG levels lower than 1.1 g/dL. (See the Ascites Albumin Gradient calculator.)\n\n\nCauses of transudative ascites include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Hepatic \n          cirrhosis\n\n\n\n\nAlcoholic hepatitis\n\n\n\n\nHeart failure\n\n\n\n\nFulminant hepatic failure\n\n\n\n\nNephrotic syndrome\n\n\n\n\nPortal vein thrombosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCauses of exudative ascites include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Peritoneal carcinomatosis\n         \n\n\n\n          Inflammation of the pancreas or biliary system\n         \n\n\n\nPeritonitis\n\n\n\n\n          Ischemic or \n          obstructed bowel\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative way of differentiating ascites due to portal hypertension from that due to other causes is to measure ascitic fluid viscosity with a cutoff of 1.65.\n [5] Ascitic fluid viscosity has also been demonstrated to predict renal impairment in hepatic patients at a cutoff of 1.35 and a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay at a cutoff of 1.995.\n\nA noninvasive method of differentiating exudative from transudative ascites by using B-mode gray-scale ultrasound histogram analysis has been described and appears to be effective.\n [6]  In this method, the ascites–to–rectus abdominis muscle echogenicity ratio (ARAER) is measured. A value higher than 0.002 is regarded as exudative ascites, whereas a value lower than 0.002 is regarded as transudative ascites.\n\nIn patients with malignant ascites related to ovarian cancer, an ascites symptom mini-scale has been developed that serves as a simple and easy tool for assessment.\n [7]  This scale includes five parameters: shortness of breath, distended abdomen, reduced mobility, fatigue, and loss of appetite. It can be used to identify patients with mild symptoms who may benefit from paracentesis.\n\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis\nInfection of ascitic fluid without intra-abdominal infection usually occurs in patients with chronic liver disease due to translocation of enteric bacteria. Common pathogens include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcal species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n [8] Patients with renal failure who use abdominal peritoneal dialysis are also at increased risk, as are children with nephrosis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Anaerobic bacteria are not associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).\n\nAn ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count higher than 250/μL (neutrocytic ascites), with the percentage of PMNs in the fluid usually greater than 50%, is presumptive evidence of SBP. Patients whose ascitic fluid meets these criteria should be treated empirically, regardless of symptoms. Secondary bacterial peritonitis is defined as infected ascitic fluid associated with an intra-abdominal infection.\n\nA report by Lutz et al demonstrated that the relative PMN count, as compared with the absolute PMN count, is a less expensive marker associated with bacterascites and can be used to predict future episodes of SBP.\n [9]  This may be useful for the purposes of risk stratification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Partial Gastrectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nGastrectomy is defined as partial when a part of the stomach is removed surgically and as total when the entire stomach is removed. Some authors further differentiate various types of partial gastrectomy on the basis of the amount of stomach removed, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nAntrectomy (30% resection)\n         \n\n\n\n          Hemigastrectomy (50% resection)\n         \n\n\n\n          Subtotal gastrectomy (80% resection)\n         \n\n\n\nThis differentiation had utility in the era of resectional surgery for ulcer disease. Antrectomy was performed with truncal vagotomy as one of the surgical procedures for duodenal ulcer or pyloric channel ulcer.\nThe advent of effective medical treatment of ulcer disease meant that gastrectomy is increasingly used for gastric cancer. At present, therefore, resection usually involves either subtotal or total gastrectomy.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical aspects\nThe first stomach resection for cancer was performed by Jules Emile Pean in 1879. A year later, a Polish surgeon named Ludwik Rydygier performed gastroenterostomy for the management of peptic ulcer disease.\n [1] Unfortunately, both of these attempts were unsuccessful.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nIn 1881, the Austrian surgeon Theodor Billroth performed a successful gastroduodenostomy in a 43-year-old woman with pyloric cancer.\n [3] It was performed following partial gastrectomy. This procedure later came to be known as the Billroth I operation to differentiate it from the Billroth II operation, in which gastrojejunal reconstruction was performed following partial gastrectomy.\n\nIn 1885, when Billroth encountered a patient with a large pyloric tumor, instead of performing gastroduodenostomy following partial gastrectomy, he performed gastrojejunostomy proximal to the growth as a bypass to alleviate the symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction as a first­-stage procedure because of the poor general condition of the patient.\n [2] A second-stage resection of the tumor was performed, and the terminal end of the stomach and proximal end of the duodenum were closed.\n [2] This was described by von Hacker as Billroth II partial gastrectomy.\n\nIn 1888, Kroenlein unsuccessfully attempted modification of Billroth II partial gastrectomy by performing an end-to-side gastrojejunostomy, which, a year later, was successfully demonstrated by von Eiselsberg.\n [4, 5] This procedure was further modified in the following years by Mikulicz, Reichel, Polya, and Finsterer.\n\nIn the present era, the Polya gastrectomy with retrocolic end-to-side gastrojejunostomy has become a commonly performed alternative to the Billroth II procedure, especially with a handsewn anastomotic technique.\n [5] Franz von Hofmeister described a partial gastrectomy with a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy involving the greater curvature, which was modified later by Hans Finsterer, and it came to be known as the Finsterer-Hofmeister operation.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Percutaneous Gastrostomy and Jejunostomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAlthough surgeons and gastroenterologists have traditionally provided enteral access services, interventional radiologists can safely, effectively, and successfully perform these procedures as well. Experience with percutaneous radiologically guided gastrostomy and gastrojejunostomy access is extensive, and experience with direct percutaneous jejunostomy access is growing. This article reviews issues and highlights areas of controversy important to radiologists providing these services.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nFirst described in 1837, surgical gastrostomy was the mainstay of direct enteral feeding access for decades. Although laparoscopic techniques for gastrostomy and jejunostomy tube access have evolved since then, their use is limited because of the acceptance of less invasive endoscopic and radiologic alternatives. Surgical gastrostomy or jejunostomy is most frequently performed when patients are already undergoing laparotomy for related or unrelated abdominal problems.\n\n\nThe advent in 1980 of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) dramatically changed the approach to gastrostomy access, and this minimally invasive procedure largely replaced surgical gastrostomy. Endoscopic gastrostomy has been accepted widely and remains the most common form of gastrostomy access. Endoscopic gastrojejunostomy and direct endoscopic jejunostomy also have been described, but these methods are less widely used and less accepted than PEG.\nSince 1983, when three independent interventional radiology groups described a percutaneous imaging-guided alternative to surgical and endoscopic gastrostomy, reports from multiple large series have described the procedure. Compared with endoscopy, fluoroscopic guidance allows the safe placement of gastrostomy tubes and allows easier initial placement of gastrojejunostomy tubes. Subsequently, direct jejunostomy access was described.\n\n\n\n\nThe degree to which individual radiology practices offer these services varies. A study using Medicare data from 2010-2018 found that fluoroscopic enteric tube placement increased by 18.2% over that period and that it was largely performed by interventional radiologists.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Percutaneous Liver Biopsy": "\nBackground\n\n\nPercutaneous liver biopsy is a procedure in which a long needle is introduced through the skin, subcutaneous tissues, intercostal muscles, and peritoneum into the liver to obtain a specimen of liver tissue.\n [1, 2] This procedure is usually performed on an outpatient basis. The patient is then observed for a few hours in the hospital or the ambulatory unit. It is safe in pediatric\n [3, 4, 5] as well as adult patients, with a low complication rate.\nThe liver biopsy needle used can be one of the following three types:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Cutting needle\n         \n\n\n\n          Suction needle (discussed in this article)\n         \n\n\n\n          Spring-loaded needle\n         \n\n\n\nThis topic focuses on the technical aspects of performing a percutaneous liver biopsy.

        "Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of Liver Tumors": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation (RFA) of liver tumors, a needle is inserted into the liver, usually under the guidance of ultrasonography (US) or computed tomography (CT).\n [1] Once the needle is placed within the tumor, a generator is used to deliver a rapidly alternating current (RF energy). This needle may be bipolar or unipolar; the latter requires grounding pads placed on the patient's thighs. Heat is generated at the site of the lesion through frictional heat produced by rapid agitation of adjacent cells and produces destruction (liquefactive necrosis) of the tumor. This technology is used widely in Europe, the United States, and Japan.\n [2] \nPercutaneous RFA is an exciting approach to destroying inoperable primary tumors or metastases in the liver.\n [3, 4, 5, 6] In the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), fewer than 40% of patients are candidates for surgery, and the rate of recurrence after curative surgery is high. Percutaneous techniques like RFA are, therefore, very important. RFA is widely used for metastatic and small primary tumors.\n [7] It serves as a bridge for transplant candidates, especially in relation to small primary lesions.\n [8] \n\n\nPercutaneous RFA is a minimally invasive, repeatable procedure with few complications. Randomized controlled trials showed that RFA is superior to ethanol injection in the treatment of small HCCs.\n [9] RFA results in a higher rate of complete necrosis and requires fewer treatment sessions than percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI).\n [10, 11, 12]  Long-term survival rates are also better with RFA. A randomized clinical trial showed that RFA yields a significantly better 1-year complete response rate than does PEI.\n [9] \nRFA in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is also an effective treatment for inoperable hepatic tumors.\n [13, 14]  RFA combined with TACE also appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of breast cancer with liver metastasis.\n [15] \n\n\n\n\nSome studies comparing percutaneous RFA and percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) showed better results with RFA in treatment of small tumors; RFA was associated with better survival rates, fewer complications, and significantly lower local recurrence rates.\n [16, 17]  However, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Glassberg et al, aimed at comparing microwave ablation (MWA) with RFA for treatment of liver cancer, found that MWA was at least as safe and effective as RFA in this setting, with significantly lower rates of local tumor progression.\n [18]  Additionals tudies are needed to define the relative merits of RFA and MWA for liver tumors.\n [19] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

When a clamp is applied to the pedicle, hemorrhage ceases if it is from either of these sources. If hemorrhage continues, the other likely sources of bleeding include the retrohepatic vena cava and hepatic veins.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

At the same time, however, it results in rapid emptying of the stomach into the duodenum (causing dumping) and allows reflux of the duodenal contents back into the stomach (causing bile gastritis).\n\n\nThere are several types of pyloroplasty, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty involves a longitudinal incision across the pylorus that is closed transversely; this is the most commonly performed pyloroplasty\n         \n\n\n\n          Jaboulay pyloroplasty involves a side-to-side gastroduodenostomy without a pylorus incision (ie, the pylorus remains intact)\n         \n\n\n\n          Finney pyloroplasty also involves a side-to-side gastroduodenostomy but with a pylorus incision (ie, the pylorus is divided)\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nPyloromyotomy and pyloric dilatation are lesser variants of pyloroplasty.

He was preceded by Codivilla in Italy, who performed the first pancreaticoduodenectomy in the 1890s; however, the patient unfortunately died in the immediate postoperative period.\nThe modern colloquial name for this operation (ie, Whipple procedure) refers to Dr Allen Oldfather Whipple, the surgeon who reported his series of pancreaticoduodenectomies in 1935. He had performed the procedure on three patients as a two-stage operation for periampullary neoplasms, then later refined his methodology to a one-stage procedure.\n\n\nIn 1937, Brunschwig extended the indications for pancreaticoduodenectomy by performing the operation for pancreatic head lesions.\nIn 1946, Waugh and Clagett described a formal en-bloc resection of the gallbladder with the common bile duct (CBD), gastric antrum, duodenum, and pancreatic head performed as a one-stage procedure, which we recognize today as the classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, the operation, though refined since Codivilla and Kausch, was utilized sparingly; perioperative mortality continued to be prohibitive, estimated as being close to 25% into the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\nAs advances in medicine yielded better perioperative outcomes across surgical applications, interest in the Whipple procedure was revitalized, and the procedure was performed increasingly often. In an effort to decrease postgastrectomy syndromes, especially nutritional, in post-Whipple patients, Traverso and Longmire described a pylorus-preserving modification in 1978.  Important subsequent advances included the application of new technologies (ie, laparoscopic and robotic approaches to pancreaticoduodenectomy).\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  More recently, a pylorus-resecting pancreaticoduodenectomy (PRPD) was described, intended mainly to address the issue of delayed gastric emptying (DGE).\n\n\n\n\nAlthough innumerable details of pancreaticoduodenectomy yield to continued innovation, a comprehensive discussion of intraoperative variants (ie, duct to mucosa vs invagination of the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis, diverse approaches to vein resection and reconstructions, nuances of each enteric anastomosis, and modifications of Roux-en-Y reconstructions, to name a few) is beyond the scope of this article.

        "Single-Port Appendectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nThis article describes a pure single-port appendectomy. Appendectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States. The lifetime risk of appendicitis is 8.6% for males and 6.7% for females.\n [1] \nFrom the first laparoscopic removal of an inflamed appendix by Kurt Semm in 1980\n [2]  to today's standard laparoscopic technique, minimally invasive surgical approaches have been widely recognized as offering significant advantages, including reduced postoperative pain, a shorter recovery time, and better cosmesis.\n [3] \n\n\nThe traditional approach to laparoscopic appendectomy employs three ports. Over the past decade, successful attempts to perform the procedure with fewer ports have been reported. The medical literature has described two-port techniques,\n [4]  hybrid approaches,\n [5, 6]  and single-port assisted techniques.\n [7, 8, 9] \nThe two-port appendectomy technique is very similar to the standard three-port technique, except that one port provides access for a rigid endoscope with a working channel, whereas the second port provides access for a grasping instrument that is used to retract the appendix.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nIn the hybrid technique, the appendix is pulled through the umbilicus, and a traditional open appendectomy is then performed extracorporeally.\n [10, 11, 12, 13] \n\n\n\n\nThe single-port assisted technique is intriguing in that a stitch is placed through the anterior abdominal wall to pull the appendix to the abdominal wall; this creates the tension necessary for performing the appendectomy intracorporeally.\n [7, 14] \n\nThe total single-port approach, as described in this article, employs a technique resembling that of a puppeteer.\n [15] A \"pulley\" is constructed in the form of a loop to the anterior abdominal wall. This loop is used as an axle over which the appendix is elevated with a string to the abdominal wall; in this way, it compensates for the absence of the additional port traditionally needed for retraction of the inflamed appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Mühe's original technique, especially the maintenance of pneumoperitoneum, proved to be so cumbersome that after performing the first six pure laparoscopic cholecystectomies, he abandoned the optically guided transumbilical approach with pneumoperitoneum for a single 3-cm subcostal incision approach in which the gallbladder was removed under direct visualization.\n [5, 6] \n\n\nSince 1985, many competitive approaches have been developed to minimize the invasiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomies, with surgeons developing new instruments and techniques to reduce postoperative pain and improve cosmesis by decreasing the number and size of necessary ports.\n [7, 8, 9]  The most recent developments in laparoscopic surgery have been the combined advances in natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), as exemplified here by single-port cholecystectomy.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Surgery for Anal Fissure": "\nBackground\n\n\nAn anal fissure is a tear of the squamous epithelium that usually extends from the dentate line to the anal verge. In 90% of cases, the fissure manifests as a painful linear ulcer lying in the posterior midline of the anal canal. The fissure may occur in other areas as well, such as the anterior midline (more commonly in female patients), or laterally. Lateral or multiple fissures are considered to be atypical, and should warrant investigation for HIV infection, Crohn disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, or hematologic malignancies.\nPatients describe the pain of anal fissures as feeling like \"passing broken glass,\" and they commonly mention a burning pain that can remain for several hours after defecation.\n [1] Many patients report having a lower quality of life because of the pain.\n [2] Bleeding can be an associated symptom that sometimes leads to the misdiagnosis of symptomatic hemorrhoids.\n [3] \n\n\nThe exact cause of anal fissures is currently unknown. Historically, an anal fissure was thought to be a result of mechanical trauma caused by a hard stool tearing the anoderm as it was passed.\n [4] In addition, anal fissures have been associated with increased anal tone for many years.\n [5]  A proposed mechanism for increased anal tone in a study by Lund showed reduced nitric oxide (NO) synthase and, consequently, decreased nitric oxide synthesis in the internal sphincters of patients with anal fissures as compared with control subjects.\n [6] NO has been known to facilitate smooth-muscle relaxation of the internal anal sphincter.\n [7] \nSchouten et al proposed that anal fissures were ischemic ulcers and found that patients with anal fissures had significantly higher resting anal sphincter tone and decreased anodermal blood flow in comparison with healthy volunteers.\n [8] Other studies confirmed that blood supply to the posterior midline of the anodermis is relatively poor when compared with blood supply to the other quadrants.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nThis combination of increased tone and poor blood supply likely contributes to the relative ischemia of the posterior midline of the anoderm; however, not all patients with anal fissures have anal sphincter hypertrophy or insufficient blood supply to the anoderm.\n\n\n\n\nPearls\nProctosigmoidoscopy may be performed prior to the procedure to fully inspect the colon, rectum, and anus to rule out concomitant pathology.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that the fissure itself does not necessarily require treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Temporary Abdominal Closure Techniques": "\nBackground\n\n\nOver the past two decades, the way in which trauma surgeons approach a patient with multiple severe injuries has undergone an evolution. Trauma surgeons no longer attempt to fix everything during the initial operation. The literature reflects their cumulative experience, which confirms that conservative operative techniques and short operating times, even when all organ repairs have not been completed, increase survival in civilian and military patients with multiple trauma. These principles hold true for all affected regions of the body, including the abdominal cavity and its contents, which constitute the focus of this article.\n [1, 2, 3] \nDamage-control principles are typically applied to patients who have multiple severe injuries. These patients are commonly hypothermic, acidotic, and coagulopathic. Under these circumstances, a deliberate, staged, reoperative approach is optimal.\n\n\nThe three commonly recognized stages of damage-control celiotomy are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Limited operative intervention for control of hemorrhage and contamination and for prevention of further injury\n         \n\n\n\n          Continuation of resuscitation in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) setting\n         \n\n\n\n          Reoperation for definitive repair, a second look for a possible missed injury or delayed manifestation of an organ injury, and formal closure of the incision if possible\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nThose who may require damage-control celiotomy are patients who are hypotensive (blood pressure [BP] < 90 mm Hg) with the following abdominal or pelvic traumatic injuries:\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetrating abdominal injury\n\n\n\n\nBlunt abdominal injury with intraperitoneal fluid noted on surgeon-performed focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) or gross blood on surgeon-performed diagnostic peritoneal paracentesis (also known as DP tap)\n         \n\n\n\n          Closed \n          pelvic fracture with intraperitoneal fluid noted on surgeon-performed FAST or gross blood on surgeon-performed DP tap\n         \n\n\n\n          Open pelvic fracture\n         \n\n\n\n          Penetrating or blunt abdominal injury with bowel edema, hypothermia, or acidosis\n         \n\n\n\n          Delayed injury with established severe intra-abdominal infection\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the organ-specific operative techniques are beyond the scope of this article, patients who undergo damage-control celiotomy are at risk for the development of multiple life-threatening complications in the early postoperative period.

        "Thoracoscopic and Laparoscopic Myotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAchalasia is an uncommon disorder of the esophagus. The disorder is characterized by inadequate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and concomitant loss of peristalsis in the body of the esophagus. (See the images below.) Patients are usually young and often present with dysphagia to both solids and liquids at the same time. Other symptoms may include regurgitation, chest pain, aspiration, and weight loss. The disorder is often mistaken for gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease (GERD), and this mistake is a common reason for a delay in diagnosis of achalasia.\n\n\n\n\n\nChest radiograph in patient with achalasia.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiograph of barium swallow in patient with long-standing achalasia.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nAchalasia is most common between the second and fifth decades of life but has been reported in people of all ages.\n [1] In the United States, the incidence is about 1 per 200,000 population.\n\n\n\n\nWith achalasia, the essential problem involves lack of normal esophageal motility and a hypertonic LES that fails to relax. The aim of surgery is to disrupt the muscle fibers of the LES to relax the esophagus and allow for passage of food.\n\n\n\n\nToday, many surgeons offer a laparoscopic procedure for the treatment of achalasia. Studies have shown that this surgery offers durable results with good short-term benefits. More than 90% of patients have relief of their symptoms immediately after surgery. In addition, the use of minimally invasive surgery has reduced the morbidity associated with open esophageal surgery. A thoracoscopic procedure has also been performed. (See Technique.)\n\nThere are many treatments for achalasia. Over the years, the role of surgery has become better defined. For mild cases of achalasia, medical therapies still play a role. Even though several medical therapies are available, the response is variable among patients, and the benefits are not sustained for longer than a few months, at best. Botulinum toxin and pneumatic dilatation may be good choices in patients who want to wait or would like a nonsurgical alternative. However, repeated balloon dilatation is associated with a risk of esophageal perforation, which appears to occur in 1-3% of cases.\n\nMinimally invasive surgery has now supplanted most medical therapies for achalasia.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] The minimally invasive approaches have a far lower morbidity and mortality than the open technique does. More than 90% of patients find effective relief from dysphagia. For those who have associated GERD, an antireflux procedure can be combined without any added morbidity.\n\nEtiology of achalasia\nAchalasia has been known to occur for more than 200 years, but its cause still remains unknown. Biopsy of the mucosa in the affected part of the esophagus often reveals loss of ganglion cells and fibrosis of myenteric plexus.\n\nThis process is likely autoimmune-regulated, given that T cells predominate in the inflammatory infiltrate.\n [8] Additional research has shown that achalasia patients have decreased nitric oxide synthase in the myenteric plexus, resulting in reduced nitric oxide production.\n [9] Because nitric oxide is a key factor in gastrointestinal (GI) smooth-muscle relaxation, its decreased presence at least partly explains the dysfunction of the LES.\n\nSymptoms of achalasia\nThe hallmark symptom of achalasia is progressive dysphagia, often first to solids and then to liquids. Because the dysphagia usually worsens very gradually, it is often quite severe upon presentation. Most patients adapt their eating behavior long before the diagnosis is made. Because stress and cold liquids may exacerbate the dysphagia, both liquids and solids may be poorly tolerated simultaneously at presentation.\n\nChest pain is also a common symptom, and patients often undergo extensive cardiac evaluation prior to diagnosis. Previously, 10-39% of patients suffered bronchopulmonary complications from repeated regurgitation and aspiration.\n [10] Many of these complications can now be avoided through earlier diagnosis and treatment. Dyspepsia occurs in about one fourth of cases, though it is usually caused by fermentation of unevacuated food in the esophagus rather than GER.\n [11]  \n\nAlso common, though often not mentioned, are the symptoms caused by fungal infection. The residual food in the esophagus makes this structure a prime target for Candida, and the resulting infection can be quite severe. Medical treatment is required to manage the candidal infection, but recurrence is common as long as achalasia persists.\n [12] \n\nPatients often have a long history of symptoms—in some cases, longer than 30 years. Weight loss is common, though patients usually alter their diets enough to maintain body mass until the disease becomes intolerable and they seek therapy. Acute onset of symptoms or rapid weight loss should be a red flag for clinicians to rule out malignancy. Ruling out pseudoachalasia (presence of a distal esophageal tumor causing dysphagia) in older patients (>55 y) is crucial,\n [13]  as is ruling it out in those with a shorter duration of symptoms (< 6 mo), or more profound, rapid weight loss (>15 lb [~7 kg]).\n\nAny patient with a questionable diagnosis should undergo a careful evaluation, to include the use of endoscopic ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) to rule out pseudoachalasia.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

TME addresses earlier treatment concerns regarding adequate local control of rectal cancer when an anterior resection is performed.\nThe term TME strictly applies in the performance of a low anterior resection for tumors of the middle and the lower rectum, wherein it is essential to remove the rectum along with the mesorectum up to the level of the levators.\n\n\nThe principles of TME (sharp mesorectal excision) are also applied during an abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and for tumors of the upper rectum, though these are considered distinct from standard TME. In an abdominoperineal excision of the rectum where the tumor exists below the level of the levators, the lateral margins of the tumor are inferior to the mesorectum, and the benefits of TME do not apply.\nAnterior resections involving the upper rectum may be completed with mobilization of the rectum to beyond 5 cm of the lower margin of the tumor, and which is often above the level of the levator and is sometimes referred to as partial mesorectal excision.\n\n\n\n\nThe treatment of rectal cancers is multimodal, with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy having benefits in some settings. In addition, accurate preoperative staging is dependent on good radiologic support. It is therefore necessary to subject all rectal cancers to multidepartment conference and to design individualized treatment plans based on a well-defined protocol.

It provides better exposure and visualization than standard transanal excision and affords access to lesions higher in the rectum. It is associated with less morbidity and quicker recovery time than a radical transabdominal approach. The major limitations of TEM have been that it requires expensive, highly specialized equipment and has a steep learning curve.\n [1]  Accordingly, it should be performed only by skilled and experienced surgeons.\nTransanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) was developed to address some of the issues encountered with TEM.\n [2] It offers several benefits over TEM: It requires minimal setup time, and the use of existing laparoscopic cameras and instruments offers a lower-cost alternative to TEM. Nonetheless, the learning curve appears to be generally comparable. \n\n\nA comparison of patients who underwent TEM (n = 53) or TAMIS (n = 68) for resection of intraluminal rectal tumors showed that although median operating time was significantly shorter for TAMIS (45 vs 65 min), blood loss was negligible in both groups.\n [3]  Resection margins, lesion grade, and invasion depth were comparable for the two approaches; however, the postoperative readmission rate was significantly higher in the TEM group (17% vs 4.4%).\nRobotic TAMIS (R-TAMIS) has been proposed as a potential alternative to both TEM and standard TAMIS.\n [4] In a case series by Schwab et al,\n [5] the three techniques were compared, and R-TAMIS tended to be faster than TEM and TAMIS and to be more likely to result in negative surgical margins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Omentum, small bowel, and colon can be found within the sac. A direct or true umbilical hernia consists of a symmetric protrusion through the umbilical ring and is seen in neonates or infants. Indirect umbilical (paraumbilical) hernias protrude above or below the umbilicus and are the most common type of umbilical hernia in adults.\n [4] \n\n\nInfantile umbilical hernias result from failure of the umbilical ring to close. The umbilical cord structures fail to fuse with the umbilical foramen, therefore leaving a patent umbilical ring. In contrast, anterior abdominal-wall defects such as gastroschisis and omphalocele result from disruption in the development of the abdominal-wall structures.\nThe distinction should be made between these two entities because of the difference in management. Umbilical hernias are managed with observation; these defects typically close by age 4 or 5 years. Any defects that persist beyond this age should undergo surgical repair.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common symptom of umbilical hernias is pain at the umbilicus (44% of cases). Other complaints include pressure (20%) and nausea and vomiting (9%).\n [5] Complications such as irreducibility, obstruction, strangulation, skin ulceration, and rupture are more common in paraumbilical hernias than in other abdominal hernias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Vagotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nVagotomy is an essential component of surgical management of peptic (duodenal and gastric) ulcer disease (PUD). Vagotomy was once commonly performed to treat and prevent PUD; however, with the availability of excellent acid secretion control with H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs; eg, cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; eg, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and lansoprazole), and anti–Helicobacter pylori medications, the need for surgical management of this condition has greatly decreased.\nThe basic types of vagotomy are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Truncal vagotomy (TV)\n          \n [1] \n\n\n\n\n          Selective vagotomy (SV)\n         \n\n\n\n          Highly selective vagotomy (HSV)\n         \n\n\n\nAll types of vagotomy can be performed at open surgery (laparotomy) or by using a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopic or robotic).\n\n\n\n\nFor the management of PUD, vagotomy is sometimes combined with antrectomy (removal of the distal half of the stomach) to reduce the rate of recurrence. Reconstruction after antrectomy is performed with gastroduodenostomy (Billroth I) or gastrojejunostomy (Billroth II).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Whole-Bowel Irrigation": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe rationale behind whole-bowel irrigation (WBI) is to prevent absorption of ingested matter (eg, extended-release medications or drug packets) by inducing a liquid stool through use of a osmotically balanced polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG-ES).\n [1, 2] \nA study of acute-on-chronic lithium toxicity concluded that patients who received WBI within 12 hours of an acute overdose (compared with those receiving WBI >12 hours after the overdose) had reduced peak serum lithium concentrations, fewer intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and a lower Poisoning Severity Score.\n [3] Early WBI as a means of gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination may lessen the need for more invasive treatment, such as hemodialysis in sustained-release lithium or potassium chloride overdose.\n [3, 4] \n\n\nAdministration of PEG-ES generally requires use of a nasogastric (NG) tube because of the large volume (>1 L in an average adult) that must be ingested over a short period. However, if insertion of an NG tube is difficult, an awake and alert patient may drink the solution instead.\nWBI can also be used safely in pediatric patients, as revealed by a study of 176 patients ranging in age from 4 months to 12 years. Only minor adverse events (eg, abdominal bloating or vomiting) occurred, and no deaths were reported.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nIn 2004, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) updated a position statement on WBI and other GI decontamination methods.\n [2] This statement, based on literature reviews and expert agreement, served as a guideline for the management of in-hospital poisoned patients. Because of the lack of controlled clinical trials showing that WBI improves clinical outcome, WBI was not recommended as a routine GI decontamination method for the poisoned patient. It should, however, be considered in certain situations (see Indications and Contraindications).\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nPEG-ES may enhance tablet dissolution of non-sustained-release preparations. An in-vitro model study comparing dissolution rates of non-sustained-release acetaminophen demonstrated increased dissolution by PEG-ES in comparison with normal saline.\n [7] \n\nIn 2015, the AACT and EAPCCT conducted a systematic review on articles published from 2003 through 2013, using multiple databases to look for new data on WBI. They found no new evidence with sound methodology to change the 2004 recommendations; however, they did find more evidence on complications from WBI (see Technique, Complications).\n [8] \n\nIn 2022, a multicenter retrospective observational study revealed that when WBI was done according to indications advised by poison centers, poisoned patients treated with WBI experienced significantly less clinical decompensation than patients not treated with WBI (11% vs 32%), despite  having similar baseline characteristics before WBI was initiated.\n [9] In multivariate analysis, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and not performing WBI were the two factors predictive of clinical deterioration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n"

        "Bladder Pressure Assessment": "\nBackground\n\n\nNormally, the viscoelastic properties of the bladder allow it to store increasing volumes of urine with little change in bladder pressure (compliance) until capacity is reached. There are 2 interrelated components of bladder compliance: the passive characteristics of the connective-tissue elements of the bladder and the active properties of the smooth muscle in the bladder.\n [7] \n\nDuring normal voiding, a coordinated series of events occurs: concurrent relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles and external sphincter and relaxation of the bladder neck, followed immediately by sustained detrusor contraction. The resultant uroflowmetry pattern recorded shows a bell-shaped flow curve with a rapid rise to peak amplitude. Following voiding, the bladder pressure decreases rapidly, the pelvic floor muscles contract, and the bladder neck closes. Phasic increases in detrusor pressure (detrusor overactivity) may be associated with frequency, urgency, and urgency urinary incontinence in patients with idiopathic overactive bladder and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrusor overactivity. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPoor compliance, defined as significant increases in bladder pressure with small increments in bladder volume, may lead to incontinence and place the upper urinary tract at risk for damage (see image below). Poor compliance is most commonly seen in patients with spinal cord injury (traumatic, compression by tumor, or related to surgical interventional for spinal malignancy) and those with myelomeningocele. Poor compliance may also occur after pelvic irradiation in both adults and children or after radical hysterectomy with or without adjuvant radiation therapy and can result from bladder fibrosis and contracture in patients previously treated for hemorrhagic cystitis caused by the use of oxazaphosphorine-alkylating agents.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreased bladder compliance. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn patients with end-stage renal disease, bladder compliance decreases the longer the duration of dialysis continues.\n [9] Moreover, the presence of anuria contributes to further decreases in bladder capacity and compliance.\n\nIn patients with suspected bladder outlet obstruction, a pressure/flow study is used to confirm the diagnosis.\n [10] In this study, the detrusor pressure required to void is plotted against the resultant flow rate. A finding of a high voiding detrusor pressure with a low flow rate indicates bladder outlet obstruction.\n\nLastly, in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, the detrusor leak point pressure is used to assess the risk of upper urinary tract damage.\n [11, 12] A detrusor leak point pressure of more than 40 cm H2O is associated with an increased risk of upper urinary tract damage.\n\nDefinitions\nAbdominal pressure (Pabd): The pressure measurement obtained from a rectal catheter during a urodynamic study.\n\nBladder compliance: The relationship between change in bladder volume and change in detrusor pressure (ΔDV/ΔDP). [The International Continence Society recommends 2 standard points be used for compliance calculations: (1) the detrusor pressure at the start of bladder filling and the corresponding bladder volume (usually zero) and (2) the detrusor pressure and corresponding bladder volume at cystometric capacity or immediately before the start of a detrusor contraction that causes significant leakage.]\n\nDetrusor leak point pressure (DLPP): The lowest detrusor pressure at which urine leakage occurs in the absence of either a detrusor contraction or an increase in abdominal pressure.\n\nDetrusor overactivity: A urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase, which may be spontaneous or provoked.\n\nDetrusor pressure (Pdet): The true bladder pressure.

        "Botulinum Toxin Injections for Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity": "\nBackground\n\n\nThis topic addresses the use of botulinum toxin injections to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). Various neurologic conditions, including multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson disease, cerebrovascular accident, and myelomeningocele, may cause detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence.\n [1]  In select conditions, such as spinal cord injury, the attendant risk of upper tract deterioration exists as a result of pyelonephritis and increased intravesical pressure as a result of poor bladder compliance and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia.\nInitial management of patients with detrusor overactivity related to a neurologic condition consists of behavioral therapy, when feasible, and anticholinergic therapy. In those patients with increased postvoid residuals, clean intermittent catheterization is often used in conjunction with anticholinergic therapy.\n\n\nHowever, the side effects of anticholinergic therapy have led to poor compliance with long-term use. In attempts to improve the efficacy and tolerability of anticholinergic therapy, several newer therapies have been developed that are available in sustained-release formulations and variable doses.\nDespite these modifications, patients whose response to anticholinergic therapy may be unsatisfactory in terms of either efficacy or tolerability exist. Historically, such individuals were faced with more invasive surgical interventions to lower detrusor pressure or promote continence, including bladder augmentation. Bladder augmentation is not without significant long-term risks, including infections, stones, malignancy, and perforation.\n\n\n\n\nA form of botulinum toxin A known as onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX; Allergan, Irvine, CA) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to NDO in adults who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of anticholinergic therapy.\n\n\n\n\nBotulinum toxin A blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. The inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), a protein critical to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from presynaptic vesicles located within the nerve endings.\n\nWhen injected into the muscle at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin A produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle, resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extra junctional acetylcholine receptors may develop. Evidence exists that reinnervation of the muscle may occur, thus slowly reversing the muscle denervation produced by botulinum toxin A.\n\nAlso proposed is that the effect of botulinum toxin A on detrusor overactivity may be related to its effect on sensory receptor expression in suburothelial fibers.\n [2] The expression of TRPV1, P2X3, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide by these fibers has also been proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology of detrusor overactivity.\n [2] Decreased levels of TRPV1 and P2X3-IR have been demonstrated in submucosal biopsies obtained after intravesical injection of botulinum toxin A.\n [2] \n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe adult bladder is located in the anterior pelvis and is enveloped by extraperitoneal fat and connective tissue. It is separated from the pubic symphysis by an anterior prevesical space known as the retropubic space (of Retzius). The dome of the bladder is covered by peritoneum, and the bladder neck is fixed to neighboring structures by reflections of the pelvic fascia and by true ligaments of the pelvis.\n\nThe body of the bladder receives support from the external urethral sphincter muscle and the perineal membrane inferiorly and the obturator internus muscles laterally (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross anatomy of the bladder. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Bladder Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Brachytherapy (Radioactive Seed Implantation Therapy) in Prostate Cancer": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn the 1970s, several centers used brachytherapy to treat prostate cancer. Implants were placed into the prostate under direct vision after open pelvic lymphadenectomy. Unfortunately, long-term follow-up revealed less than satisfactory results in terms of cancer control.\n\nCurrently, these less than optimal results are thought to have resulted from 2 problems. The first was a technical inability to accurately implant the sources. The second was the relative paucity of objective dosimetric criteria by which to analyze the radiation dose in that era. Interest in brachytherapy waned in the early 1980s because of these results, the advent of more advanced external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) equipment, and the development of the nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the emergence of transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and the development of template guidance led to the introduction of percutaneous brachytherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. This technique was supported by improved dosimetry and offered the potential advantage of delivering a higher radiation dose to the prostate than would be possible with EBRT. This latter consideration was particularly important in view of the high rate of positive prostate biopsy findings following conventional EBRT.\n\nAlong with radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, and EBRT (also referred to as intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]), interstitial brachytherapy is a potentially curative treatment for localized prostate cancer. For appropriately selected patients, brachytherapy appears to offer cancer control comparable to that achieved with these other techniques. Although proponents of brachytherapy claim better quality-of-life results, the evidence supporting this claim is mixed.\n\nThe various institutions that offer brachytherapy have subtle differences in technique. Most of the techniques discussed in this article are generic, but some modifications are unique to the implant procedure performed at the University of Virginia.\n\nPermanent versus temporary brachytherapy\nIn addition to permanent brachytherapy, temporary brachytherapy has also been used. In this technique, the implants deliver radiation to the prostate at a higher dose rate than is provided by a permanent implant. Currently, the isotope most commonly used for temporary brachytherapy is iridium (Ir)-192, which provides a higher dose of radiation than the iodine (I)-125 and palladium (Pd)-103 permanent implants.\n\nFor high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRB), a preplan is devised using TRUS to deliver 15 Gy/h to the prostate and smaller doses to the urethra and rectum. During the implantation, hollow needles are inserted transperineally and checked via TRUS to ensure reproduction of the preplan template. The needles are then connected to an automated remote-controlled loading machine. This device successively moves Ir-192 wires into the needles to the dwell positions for various durations. The total irradiation time is usually only 5-10 minutes.\n\nHDRB is commonly delivered in 2 or more fractions of 810 Gy or more, with 6-24 hours between treatments. Patients require hospitalization while the implants remain in place but may go home once the implants are removed.\n\nHDRB is usually used in combination with IMRT.\n [1] The optimal patient population has not yet been determined. Most series reported are from single centers.\n\nEarly experience with HDRB revealed excessive toxicity, and subsequently, adjustments were made to fractionate the dose into 4-7 treatments. Advantages of this approach include a short duration of treatment, minimization of applicator movement, and optimization of dose distribution because sources are mobile. Disadvantages include increased adverse effects and the need for hospitalization.\n\nThe American Brachytherapy Society has published consensus guidelines for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy,\n [2] which note a growing experience with the use of this modality as monotherapy.\n\nMost brachytherapy for prostate cancer is performed by means of the permanent technique, which is the focus of the remainder of this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Burch Colposuspension": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nBurch colposuspension is used to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Stress urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine during periods of increased intra-abdominal pressure, including exertion such as laughing, coughing, sneezing, coughing, and jumping.\n\n\nIn a continent individual, increased abdominal pressure is evenly distributed over the bladder, bladder neck, and urethra. The urethral sphincter is thus able to withstand this pressure and maintain continence. In a person with pure stress urinary incontinence, either the urethra is hypermobile or the sphincter is intrinsically deficient. In urethral hypermobility, the urethral vesicular junction (UVJ) is displaced extra-abdominally, and the increased intra-abdominal pressure is unevenly distributed such that the sphincter can no longer withstand the pressure and urine leaks. With intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD), the UVJ is not hypermobile; however, the maximal urethral closing pressure, the Valsalva leak-point pressure, or both are too low to withstand the increase in intra-abdominal pressure and, thus, urine leaks past the sphincter.\nAn image depicting Burch suspension can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurch colposuspension. \n\n\n\n\n\nBoth conservative management (pelvic floor muscle training, incontinence pessaries, and urethral bulking agents) as well as surgical management are acceptable approaches to treating stress urinary incontinence.\n\nAt present, the primary forms of surgical management of stress urinary incontinence are retropubic urethropexy and midurethral sling procedures. The 3 most common abdominal procedures are the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz (MMK) procedure, the Burch procedure, and the paravaginal fascial repair. This article focuses on retropubic urethropexy, specifically Burch colposuspension.\n\nRetropubic approaches include Burch retropubic urethropexy and the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz (MMK) procedure. The goal of both of these procedures is to suspend and stabilize the urethra so that the urethrovesical junction (UVJ) and proximal urethra are replaced intra-abdominally. This anatomic placement allows normal pressure transmission during periods of increased intra-abdominal pressure restoring continence in a previously incontinent, hypermobile UVJ.\n\nThe Burch procedure was described in 1961.\n [1] Initially, Burch described attaching the paravaginal fascia to the arcus tendineus. However, he later changed the point of attachment to Cooper's ligaments because these were felt to provide more secure fixation points, and less chance of infection as seen with the prior MMK procedure.\n\nAlthough its durability has been proven, the open repair is less commonly performed due to the advent of less invasive procedures. However, a role for this procedure remains when concomitant open surgery is planned in conjunction with surgical correction of stress urinary incontinence. Laparoscopic surgeons have also demonstrated that the repair can be performed via a laparoscopic approach, decreasing morbidity, while still providing a satisfactory outcome.\n\nA retrospective cohort study of robot-assisted Burch colposuspension by Tappy et al reported low rates of perioperative complications.\n [2] \n\nIndications\nEligible patients include women who decline or have persistent symptoms following a trial of conservative management. Women who have mixed urinary incontinence may be able to control their symptoms of urge incontinence and provide enough satisfaction that management of stress urinary incontinence is no longer necessary.\n\nThe patient requiring concomitant abdominal surgery that cannot be performed vaginally is a candidate for an open Burch colposuspension. A recommendation is that the procedure be performed only if the patient has adequate vaginal mobility and capacity to allow elevation and approximation of the lateral vaginal fornices to Cooper’s ligament on either side. In addition, although it may be used in the setting of a prior failed repair, Amaye et al concluded that the Burch procedure should not be used after more than one previous operation due to low success rates compared to a sling procedure.\n [3] \n\nUpdated guidelines from the American Urological Association/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction Adult Urodynamics recommend colposuspension as an approach for women with stress urinary incontinence who want to avoid both fascial harvest and mesh, especially if they are planning to have a simultaneous abdominal-pelvic procedure (eg, an open or minimally invasive hysterectomy).\n [4] \n\nContraindications\nPatients with type III stress urinary incontinence (a fixed, nonfunctioning proximal urethra) are not candidates for a Burch procedure as no hypermobility exists to correct. These patients are better served by a mid-urethral sling procedure.\n [5] \n\nThe Burch procedure does not allow for correction of central defect cystocele, rectocele, or introital deficiency, and, thus, consideration of an alternative treatment is indicated.\n [6] \n\nAmaye et al showed that selection of surgery used can influence the outcome with treatment of recurrent urodynamic stress urinary incontinence.\n [3] \n\nWomen who have not completed childbearing should delay surgical management of stress urinary incontinence because pregnancy disrupts pelvic support. Both vaginal delivery and caesarean section have proven to show recurrent incontinence after anti-incontinence procedures (midurethral sling procedures were specifically reviewed by Groenen et al).\n [7] \n\nLastly, all patients should be evaluated to determine fitness for surgery, as this is an elective procedure.\n\nProcedure Planning\nThe Burch procedure can be performed via open or laparoscopic approach. Historically, the Burch procedure was used when concomitant open surgery was being performed, and this can now be adjusted to accomodate a laparoscopic approach.\n\nOutcomes\nThe decision to perform an open versus laparoscopic procedure depends on the skills of the surgeon. Moehrer et al published a systematic review on laparoscopic colposuspension using the Cochrane Incontinence Review Groups’ registry of randomized controlled trials, including 4 studies in the meta-analysis.\n [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] The meta-analysis demonstrated that subjective perception of cure was no different between the groups, ranging from 85-96% in the laparoscopic group and 85-100% in the open group after 6-18 months of follow-up. When urodynamics were used to measure outcome, the success rate for the laparoscopic approach was significantly lower than that for open (RR 0.89, CI 0.82-0.98) with an additional 9% risk of failure for laparoscopic versus open colposuspension (risk diff -0.09, 95%; CI -0.16-0.02).\n\nSeveral cohort studies have shown similar cure rates between laparoscopic and open Burch colposuspension.\n [13, 14, 15] An objective cure rate of 89-98% with follow-up to 36 months has been reported in several case series.\n [16, 17, 13] \n\nA multicenter randomized trial comparing the pubovaginal sling using autologous rectus fascia and the Burch colposuspension in 665 women demonstrated a higher success rate for treatment of stress urinary incontinence with the autologous fascial sling, but it was also associated with greater morbidity.\n [18] \n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis by Fusco et al that included 28 randomized controlled trials and 15,855 patients reported that patients receiving midurethral sling had higher success rates than those receiving Burch colposuspension (82% vs 74%) and also higher objective continence rates (negative stress test: 79.7% vs 67.8%).\n [19] \n\nRichter et al studied patient-related factors associated with long-term urinary continence after Burch colposuspension or pubovaginal fascial sling surgery for stress urinary incontinence. They found that preoperative and postoperative urgency incontinence symptoms, prior stress urinary incontinence surgery, Burch urethropexy, and menopausal status were significantly and negatively associated with long-term continence rates.\n [20] \n\nLapitan et al reviewed 33 trials involving 2403 women who underwent open Burch colposuspension and found overall cure rates to be between 68.9% and 88.0%. Continence rates at 1 year were 85-90% but dropped to 70% 5 years after surgery.\n [21] Laparoscopic Burch procedures, however, have an approximately 72% cure rate in stress urinary incontinence, as reported by Hong et al in 49 patients.

        "Cryotherapy in Prostate Cancer": "\nBackground\n\n\nCryotherapy—the ablation of tissue through local induction of extremely cold temperatures—has its earliest antecedent in 19th-century London, where Arnott applied ice-salt mixtures to cancers of the breast and cervix.\n [2] The 1966 advent of probes cooled by liquid nitrogen in closed circulation marks the beginning of modern cryotherapy.\n [3] \n\nOne of the first applications of this new technology was the transurethral cryoablation of benign prostatic hyperplastic tissue,\n [4] followed shortly thereafter by the treatment of prostate cancer via an open perineal approach.\n [5] The transperineal approach was introduced in 1974, initially using a single digitally guided cryoprobe that was repositioned as needed during the procedure.\n [6] \n\nEarly series of cryotherapy achieved effective tissue ablation, and complications were considered to be less severe than those of radical surgery at the time. The major impediment to early acceptance of the modality, however, was the inability to achieve accurate monitoring of cryoprobe placement and ice-ball formation.\n\nSubsequent advances, which have reinvigorated investigation into the use of cryotherapy for prostate cancer, have included the use of real-time transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) to monitor probe placement and freezing,\n [7] the simultaneous use of multiple cryoprobes, and the standard use of urethral warming catheters.\n [8] \n\nA particularly significant development was the introduction of cryotherapy probes that use argon gas rather than liquid nitrogen. Argon rapidly cools the probe tip to –187°C (–304.6°F) and can be rapidly exchanged with helium at 67°C (152.6°F) for an active thawing phase, producing a faster response to operator input and significantly speeding 2-cycle treatment.\n [9] \n\nMoreover, argon-based probes have a much smaller diameter than nitrogen-based probes. Thus, they permit direct, sharp transperineal insertion, rendering tract dilation unnecessary and facilitating more conformal cryosurgery by allowing placement of more probes.\n [10] \n\nSince the mid-1990s, cryotherapy has seldom been used in community urologic practice, despite the initiation of Medicare reimbursement for the procedure in 1999. According to polls conducted by the American Urological Association (AUA), the percentage of urologists performing cryosurgery from 1997-2001 remained constant at 2%, though the average annual number of procedures performed by each urologist increased from 4 to 24.\n [11] \n\nIn contrast, the percentage of urologists performing brachytherapy over the same period rose from 16% to 51%, and the annual number of procedures performed by each urologist rose from 15 to 16.5.\n [11] \n\nNevertheless, ongoing technical advances and accumulating results from academic centers suggest that cryotherapy may be poised to capture an increased role as an alternative to other, more standard approaches to management of localized prostate cancer.\n\nOutcomes have now been reported as late as 7 years after treatment and seem to compare favorably with those reported in contemporary series of patients who receive radiation therapy, particularly with respect to late failure rates\n [12] and among higher-risk patients.\n [13] \n\nIt must be acknowledged, however, that even the largest cryotherapy studies have been retrospective examinations of largely single-institution experiences. Moreover, they have used disparate definitions of clinical risk, biochemical failure, continence, and potency; these definitions all must be standardized for cryotherapy.\n\nFor fair comparisons to be made with other modalities, prospective studies, ideally randomized, must be conducted; such studies should use consistent definitions, even across treatment modalities, and must control for clinical risk parameters. Given the relative paucity of alternatives for patients who experience biochemical progression after radiotherapy, cryosurgery may also prove a good alternative for those whose tumors appear to remain localized despite progression.\n\nFor patient education information, see the Prostate Health Center and the Cancer and Tumors Center, as well as Prostate Cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

The technique depends on contrast media being introduced into the bladder via a urethral catheter, allowing visualization of anatomic defects and workup of functional abnormalities.\nUrodynamic evaluation is the standard of care for any type of voiding abnormality in order to illuminate the pathophysiology of the patient’s condition. The study guides decision-making about surgical intervention and treatment, and it indicates to physicians which patients will require closer follow-up. Videourodynamics refers to a urodynamic study with radiographic imaging and is recommended in the following settings: renal transplant, neurogenic bladder, urinary diversion, and previous irradiation or pelvic surgery.\n\n\nIn the setting of more advanced radiographic techniques (such as voiding urosonography), cystography may be phased out as the gold standard for imaging examination. These practice changes often depend on the setting in which they are performed. For example, retrograde computed tomography (CT) is favored in trauma workup. Despite these advances, cystography supplements urodynamic evaluation and remains prevalent as a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) study in children.\nRelevant anatomy\nThe bladder is a muscular organ that sits behind the pubic symphysis in the pelvis. Its function (and lack thereof) depends on a careful balance of musculoskeletal, neurologic (both autonomic and somatic), and psychological inputs that control filling and voiding. There must be coordination between detrusor muscle relaxation and contraction of the bladder neck and pelvic floor muscles, which both maintain the contents of the bladder. By the same token, detrusor contraction and sphincter relaxation facilitate the passage of urine from the bladder. Dysfunction of any part of this yin and yang results in incontinence.

        "Cystoprostatectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nCancer of the urinary bladder is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and the most expensive cancer to manage on a median-cost-per-case basis. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 83,730 new diagnoses and 17,200 deaths occurred in 2021.\n [1] \nManagement of the disease is roughly divided into minimally invasive management of superficial disease via transurethral tumor resection with intravesical immunotherapy and chemotherapy and radical surgery for recurrent high-grade or invasive disease. Conceptually, radical cystoprostatectomy involves wide en bloc excision of all cancer-bearing tissues in the pelvis, including the bladder and prostate, using the musculoskeletal boundaries of the pelvis as the planes of dissection. The aim is removal of all tumor-bearing tissues with a wide negative tumor margin and removal of regional draining lymph nodes.\n\n\nAttempts at radical cystoprostatectomy date back to 1887, when Bardeneuer of Germany performed the first cystectomy without diversion of the urine, resulting in overwhelming sepsis and death a few days after the surgery. The modern era of cystoprostatectomy dates to the publication of the radical cystectomy series of Marshall and Whitmore in 1962.\n [2] In their series of 230 patients at Cornell Medical Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, they observed 5-year survival rates of 21-49% and perioperative mortality of more than 10%. With improved perioperative care reducing the perioperative mortality to less than 5%,\n [3]  more recent series have shown 10-year cancer specific survival in the 65–78% range.\n [4] \nCommon indications for radical cystoprostatectomy include recurrent high-grade superficial bladder cancers (stage Ta), invasive bladder cancers (stage T1 and higher), and endoscopically unmanageable bladder cancers. Contraindications include locally unresectable bladder cancers, known active metastatic disease, and medical comorbidities precluding tolerance of a long and complicated operation. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can play a role in clinically downstaging patients and treating patients unable to tolerate surgery, although these approaches have inferior outcomes when compared to surgery. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy can also play a role in improving survival with patients having stage T2 or higher disease.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe anatomy of the bladder forms an extraperitoneal muscular urine reservoir that lies behind the pubic symphysis in the pelvis. A normal bladder functions through a complex coordination of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychological functions that allow filling and emptying of the bladder contents. The prime effector of continence is the synergic relaxation of detrusor muscles and contraction of the bladder neck and pelvic floor muscles.\n\n\n\n\nThe adult bladder is located in the anterior pelvis and is enveloped by extraperitoneal fat and connective tissue. It is separated from the pubic symphysis by an anterior prevesical space known as the retropubic space (of Retzius). The dome of the bladder is covered by peritoneum, and the bladder neck is fixed to neighboring structures by reflections of the pelvic fascia and by true ligaments of the pelvis.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Bladder Anatomy.

Bozzini used this innovation for viewing the bullets in his patients.\n [1] The cystourethroscope has been greatly improved by the introduction of cold light, the enhancement of the optical system, and the development of videoendoscopy, flexible instruments, and virtual endoscopy.\n [2, 3] \n\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe adult bladder is located in the anterior pelvis and is enveloped by extraperitoneal fat and connective tissue.

        "External Beam Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nExternal beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is one of the primary treatment modalities for patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. It is commonly used in the treatment of patients who have a greater likelihood of non–organ-confined disease.\nThe image below depicts an EBRT unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit used to deliver conventional external beam radiotherapy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nConventional EBRT\nConventional EBRT is typically delivered by means of a 4-field technique. The 4 fields (anteroposterior [AP], posteroanterior [PA], left lateral, and right lateral) are designed to include the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and the regional lymphatic vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe morbidity of radiation treatment is intimately linked to the volume of normal tissue treated. Conventional radiotherapy includes irradiation of large volumes of tissue, including the skin, small bowel, bladder, large bowel, pelvic bones, and additional areas of soft tissue.\n\n3-Dimensional conformal radiotherapy\nIn 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), the radiation beam is shaped to include the 3D anatomic configuration of the prostate and any specified adjacent tissue (including the seminal vesicles and periprostatic adventitial tissues). This technique allows more precise delivery of therapy to the target organ or organs.\n\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can achieve tightly conformal dose distributions with the use of nonuniform radiation beams. The intent of this form of therapy is to create highly conformal fields by treating the patient with multiple static portals (so-called step-and-shoot IMRT) or dynamic fields. In dynamic IMRT, a series of arcs are administered through the area of interest. Multileaf collimators (MLCs) are reshaped many times as the machine performs a series of arc rotations around the target.\n\nImage-guided radiotherapy\nThe term image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) refers to the use of imaging techniques, including the following, in an attempt to ensure proper target localization during the course of radiotherapy:\n\n\n\n\n\nInterfractional assessment (static)\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nPortal imaging - The implantation of radiopaque fiducial markers into the prostatic target allows a soft tissue target to be localized with portal imaging technology\n\n\n\n\nUltrasonography - Ultrasonographic images of the prostate are obtained on a daily basis to identify the gland’s relative position\n\n\n\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning - The radiation used for therapy can also be used to generate a CT image\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nRadiofrequency localization - Small radio transponders can be implanted in the prostate to facilitate patient setup\n\n\n\nProton beam therapy\nIn contrast to photon beam therapy, the entrance radiation dose in proton beam therapy tends to be significantly less than the maximum energy of the clinical beam. Proton beams have a characteristic Bragg peak. Beyond this point, where energy is at a maximum intensity level, radiation energy rapidly falls off, which is important in the management of normal tissue toxicity.\n\nTomotherapy\nTomotherapy consists of helical radiotherapy using a computed tomography (CT)-like gantry and a rotating radiation beam that passes through the target area of interest; this modality has been used in the management of primary central nervous system tumors and viscera-based malignancies.\n\nHypofractionated radiotherapy\nIn this form of therapy, radiation is delivered from an accelerator, with the equipment mounted to a computer-guided robotic arm. Because the machine is capable of treating the target at angles that are not possible with conventional rotation-based equipment, it yields the theoretical advantage of conforming the dose more closely to the target organ’s shape\n\nRadiotherapy and androgen ablation\nData from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) have shown a clear improvement in biochemical control of disease when patients receive a combination of radiotherapy and androgen-suppressive treatment. The results of several phase III clinical trials suggest that the true benefit of combining radiotherapy with androgen blockade may lie in the potentially synergistic effects of the 2 treatments.\n\nAdjunctive EBRT\nCombined prostate implantation and EBRT\n\nA comprehensive literature review indicated that for high-risk patients, combination therapies involving EBRT and brachytherapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy appear to be superior to more localized treatments, such as seed implant alone, surgery alone, or EBRT.\n [3] \n\nEBRT after radical prostatectomy\n\nMulti-institutional data from the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) consensus conference suggest that in patients treated for a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, postoperative radiotherapy (typically in a dose range of 60-65 Gy) offers a PSA remission rate of 70%. Unfortunately, the durability of this response varies widely from center to center, with averages ranging from 25 to 67 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nPrior to the introduction of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 1980, the only treatment available for calculi that could not pass through the urinary tract was open surgery. Since then, ESWL has become the preferred tool in the urologist’s armamentarium for the treatment of renal stones, proximal stones, and midureteral stones. Compared with open and endoscopic procedures, ESWL is minimally invasive, exposes patients to less anesthesia, and yields equivalent stone-free rates in appropriately selected patients.\nThe efficacy of ESWL lies in its ability to pulverize calculi in vivo into smaller fragments, which the body can then expulse spontaneously. Shockwaves are generated and then focused onto a point within the body. The shockwaves propagate through the body with negligible dissipation of energy (and therefore damage) owing to the minimal difference in density of the soft tissues. At the stone-fluid interface, the relatively large difference in density, coupled with the concentration of multiple shockwaves in a small area, produces a large dissipation of energy. Via various mechanisms, this energy is then able to overcome the tensile strength of the calculi, leading to fragmentation. Repetition of this process eventually leads to pulverization of the calculi into small fragments (ideally < 1 mm) that the body can pass spontaneously and painlessly.\n\n\nTechnical aspects\nAll lithotripsy machines share 4 basic components: (1) a shockwave generator, (2) a focusing system, (3) a coupling mechanism, and (4) an imaging/localization unit.\n\n\n\n\nShockwave generator\nShockwaves can be generated in 1 of 3 ways, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrohydraulic: The original method of shockwave generation (used in the Dornier HM3) was electrohydraulic, meaning that the shockwave is produced via spark-gap technology. In an electrohydraulic generator, a high-voltage electrical current passes across a spark-gap electrode located within a water-filled container. The discharge of energy produces a vaporization bubble, which expands and immediately collapses, thus generating a high-energy pressure wave.\n\n\n\n\nPiezoelectric: The piezoelectric effect produces electricity via application of mechanical stress. The Curie brothers first demonstrated this in 1880. The following year, Gabriel Lippman theorized the reversibility of this effect, which was later confirmed by the Curie brothers. The piezoelectric generator takes advantage of this effect. Piezoelectric ceramics or crystals, set in a water-filled container, are stimulated via high-frequency electrical pulses. The alternating stress/strain changes in the material create ultrasonic vibrations, resulting in the production of a shockwave.\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic: In an electromagnetic generator (as seen below), a high voltage is applied to an electromagnetic coil, similar to the effect in a stereo loudspeaker. This coil, either directly or via a secondary coil, induces high-frequency vibration in an adjacent metallic membrane. This vibration is then transferred to a wave-propagating medium (ie, water) to produce shockwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic generator system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing systems\nThe focusing system is used to direct the generator-produced shockwaves at a focal volume in a synchronous fashion. The basic geometric principle used in most lithotriptors is that of an ellipse. Shockwaves are created at one focal point (F1) and converge at the second focal point (F2). The target zone, or blast path, is the 3-dimensional area at F2, where the shockwaves are concentrated and fragmentation occurs.\n\nFocusing systems differ, depending on the shockwave generator used. Electrohydraulic systems used the principle of the ellipse; a metal ellipsoid directs the energy created from the spark-gap electrode. In piezoelectric systems, ceramic crystals arranged within a hemispherical dish direct the produced energy toward a focal point. In electromagnetic systems, the shockwaves are focused with either an acoustic lens (Siemens system) or a cylindrical reflector (Storz system).\n\nCoupling mechanisms\nIn the propagation and transmission of a wave, energy is lost at interfaces with differing densities. As such, a coupling system is needed to minimize the dissipation of energy of a shockwave as it traverses the skin surface. The usual medium used is water, as this has a density similar to that of soft tissue and is readily available. In first-generation lithotriptors (Dornier HM3), the patient was placed in a water bath. However, with second- and third-generation lithotriptors, small water-filled drums or cushions with a silicone membrane are used instead of large water baths to provide air-free contact with the patient's skin. This innovation facilitates the treatment of calculi in the kidney or the ureter, often with less anesthesia than that required with the first-generation devices.\n\nLocalization systems\nImaging systems are used to localize the stone and to direct the shockwaves onto the calculus, as well as to track the progress of treatment and to make alterations as the stone fragments. The 2 methods commonly used to localize stones include fluoroscopy and ultrasonography.\n\nFluoroscopy, which is familiar to most urologists, involves ionizing radiation to visualize calculi. As such, fluoroscopy is excellent for detecting and tracking calcified and otherwise radio-opaque stones, both in the kidney and the ureter. Conversely, it is usually poor for localizing radiolucent stones (eg, uric acid stones). To compensate for this shortcoming, intravenous contrast can be introduced or (more commonly) cannulation of the ureter with a catheter and retrograde instillation of contrast (ie retrograde pyelography) can be performed.\n\nUltrasonographic localization allows for visualization of both radiopaque and radiolucent renal stones and the real-time monitoring of lithotripsy. Most second-generation lithotriptors can use this imaging modality, which is much less expensive to use than radiographic systems. Although ultrasonography has the advantage of preventing exposure to ionizing radiation, it is technically limited by its ability to visualize ureteral calculi, typically due to interposed air-filled intestinal loops. In particular, smaller stones may be difficult to localize accurately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Filiform and Follower Urethral Catheterization": "\nOverview\n\n\nUrethral catheterization can be difficult for various reasons, including false passage during recent or past catheter placement attempts, prior urethral trauma resulting in urethral stricture, enlargement of the prostate gland (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer), or prior surgery on the urinary tract (eg, transurethral prostatectomy [TURP], hypospadias repair). In these scenarios, urologists are often called to the operating room or bedside to assist with the placement of urethral catheters when the primary team is unsuccessful.\nThese difficult catheterizations often require additional equipment such as specialty wires, catheters, or bedside flexible cystoscopy. However, predating the advent of flexible cystoscopy, the urologist was able to place the catheter blindly by drawing on a broader understanding of urethral anatomy and increased tactile experience. Foremost in their armamentarium were filiforms and followers. These tools allow blind negotiation of the true path of the urethral lumen and ultimately access the bladder. Filiforms are smaller than urethral catheters and more likely to pass through narrowings of the urethra. The followers can then be used to dilate the narrowing to a size suitable for passage of a urethral catheter.\n [1] \n\n\nWhen this technique is successful, it eliminates the need for cystoscopy or suprapubic tube placement if a flexible cystoscope is not available. Furthermore, dilation can be therapeutic and may give the patient a better chance at being able to void spontaneously when the catheter is removed. In fact, filiforms and followers are still widely used for dilation in men with known urethral stricture disease.\n [2]  Zisman et al report that filiforms and followers have been used to dilate urethral strictures after metoidioplasty and phalloplasty in transgender men.\n [3] \nMoreover, a study by Granieri et al found that nationally in the United States, in an emergency department setting, urethral dilation is more common than suprapubic tube (SPT) placement for the treatment of acute urinary retention due to urethral stricture; however, SPT placement has seen increased use. Data were culled from the 2006-2010 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, with 85% of men with acute urinary retention undergoing urethral dilation and 15% being treated with SPT placement.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nAlthough the filiform/follower technique was once commonly employed in difficult catheterizations, a survey noted that less than 10% of urology residents in the United States would use filiforms and followers if they failed on their initial attempt to place a Foley catheter (with up to 74% instead opting to use flexible cystoscopy). This downward trend in the use of filiforms and followers is due in combination to the increased availability of flexible cystoscopy and the challenges senior urologists face in teaching residents to correctly use tactile sensation.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Injectable Bulking Agents for Incontinence": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nInjectable therapy using bulking agents composed of synthetic materials, bovine collagen, or autologous substances augment the urethral wall and increase urethral resistance to urinary flow. More recently, investigations of stem cell injections have shown promise for use. The injection of bulking agents to treat a dysfunctional urethra is a minimally invasive method of correcting intrinsic sphincteric deficiency that results in stress urinary incontinence but is being performed less frequently in current practice.\n\n\nEvidence in major reviews shows low efficacy rates compared with surgical incontinence therapies, a need for repeat treatments because of symptom recurrence, and problems with the injection of some synthetic agents. However, initial research on the injection of stem cells shows promise with regard to efficacy and durability. Overall, injections of urethral bulking agents can help the group of patients that is unfit or unwilling to undergo surgery for incontinence.\n [1, 2, 3] \nGo to Urinary Incontinence and Surgical Treatment of Urinary Incontinence for complete information on these topics.\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nInjectable agents have been used to manage stress urinary incontinence for more than a decade, but their application has been limited by placement, durability, antigenicity, and other compatibility issues. The lack of a single, reproducible response from one agent has led to the development and application of several agents that provide reasonable efficacy with minimal associated morbidity. The continuous development of techniques and materials provides the basis for newer bulking agents. Likewise, recent research has shown promise in the use of stem cells in periurethral injections.\n\n\n\n\nUrethral bulking procedures are designed to treat stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency by artificially inflating the submucosal tissues of the bladder neck and urethra. These procedures involve injecting synthetic and autologous fillers into the wall of the urethra to aid in coaptation of the mucosa. Bulking the bladder neck with particulate matter effectively closes the lumen of the urethra by improving urethral coaptation and restores the mucosal seal mechanism of continence. However, issues with migration, leakage, and resorption of injected agents challenge therapeutic durability.\n\nBulking procedures are minimally invasive and are useful for treating women with incontinence who wish to avoid open surgical procedures for various reasons.\n [4] Methods used to bulk the female urethra include transurethral and periurethral injection techniques. The delivery techniques for the male urethra are largely transurethral. Careful patient selection appears to be important but is not essential for a successful outcome when this form of minimally invasive therapy is considered, especially in less active patients who are at a higher risk for the complications inherent to more invasive procedures.\n [5] \n\nSee the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriurethral injection therapy for incontinence.

Likewise, dextranomer hyaluronic acid has since been removed from the market because of injection site complications.\n\nRecent research has focused on the use of stem cells for stress urinary incontinence treatment. To date, autologous cells derived from either muscle or adipose tissue of the patient have been studied.\n [7] Such stem-cell therapies for urinary incontinence may have the ability to regenerate a damaged or weakened rhabdosphincter in addition to providing a bulking effect after injection. Because their effect is improved sphincter function rather than coaptation from a bulking effect, they are not discussed further in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The initial series reported operative times that ranged from 8 to 11 hours and a mean hospital stay of 7.3 days.\n\n\n\n\nThe laparoscopic approach gained new attention when 2 French groups published their experience with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in 1999 and 2000.\n [3, 4] They reported modifications to the original technique, resulting in operative times that ranged from 4 to 5 hours and had a mean blood loss of 402 mL. The authors also reported a decreased mean hospital stay, due predominantly to earlier removal of the Foley catheter.\n\nEven in the hands of these skilled laparoscopists, nerve-sparing dissection and construction of the urethrovesical anastomosis were demanding. With advances in medical technology, improved optics, and the widespread use of new laparoscopic instrumentation such as ultrasonic cutting and coagulating devices (eg, Harmonic scalpel), laparoscopic radical prostatectomy began to gain acceptance and was increasingly performed in several high-volume centers worldwide. However, the technical demands of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy prevented its widespread use by the average urologist and thus limited penetration.\n\nAdvent of robotic surgical technology\nThe next significant advance in the surgical treatment of localized prostate cancer was the development of robotic surgical technology. Initially developed by the United States Department of Defense for use in military battlefield applications, robotic technology was adapted for civilian use through the entrepreneurial efforts of 2 rival corporations, Intuitive Surgical, Inc, and Computer Motion, Inc. These companies simultaneously developed robotic interfaces for use in human surgical applications. Computer Motion, Inc, introduced the Zeus Surgical System at approximately the same time that Intuitive Surgical, Inc, developed its da Vinci Surgical System.\n\nBoth technologies relied heavily on a laparoscopic patient-robot interface in which instruments were placed through small trocars implanted in the patient’s skin. The working field was maintained predominantly by insufflation of the peritoneal cavity with carbon dioxide. Subsequently, Intuitive Surgical, Inc, acquired Computer Motion, Inc, consolidating the robotic surgical technology and making Intuitive Surgical, Inc, the sole provider of advanced robotic technology for use in human surgical procedures.\n\nSeveral other companies also develop and manufacture robotic surgical technology, including single robotic arms for laparoscopic cameras or as part of integrated minimally invasive operating-room systems, but none of these rival technologies can compete with the advanced robotic engineering by Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nThe da Vinci Surgical System consists of a 3- or 4-armed robot connected to a remote console. The surgeon operates the system while seated at the console. Foot pedals are used for control, and 3-dimensional displays provide a unique and novel depiction of the surgical field not previously incorporated in other systems. Typically, 8- to 10-mm ports are used for the instruments, which have 7° of freedom, including rotation capabilities (ie, mimicking the movements of the human wrist), and a special robotic EndoWrist. The first reported robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy using the da Vinci system was described by Abbou et al in 2001.\n [5] Several other groups have also published their experience with the technique.\n [6, 7] \n\nRise of robotic radical prostatectomy\nMenon et al from the Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, are responsible for the development and popularization of robotic radical prostatectomy.\n [8, 9, 10, 11] This technique has been gaining widespread acceptance in the United States and Europe and is increasing in penetration worldwide.\n [12] Robotic radical prostatectomy offers the advantages of the minimally invasive laparoscopic approach but shortens the learning curve, facilitating and hastening mastery of the procedure.\n\nAlthough solid basic laparoscopic skills are required for access and assistance, the console surgeon role requires less laparoscopic skill. Therefore, the procedure is accessible to experienced open-procedure surgeons with minimal or no laparoscopic experience. In a published report, Badani et al have performed more than 2700 robotic prostatectomies and have reported a mean operative time of 154 minutes, a mean blood loss of 100 mL, and hospital stays of less than 24 hours in 96.7% of patients.\n [13] \n\nThe following image provides a portion of a minimally invasive radical prostatectomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy.

Prior benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) surgery, along with large prostate size, pose technical challenges and increase operative times and blood loss during robotic radical prostatectomy.\n [16] \n\nRobotics versus laparoscopy\nThe advantages and disadvantages of robotic techniques compared with laparoscopic techniques in radical prostatectomy are briefly discussed.\n\nAdvantages of robotic techniques\n\nBecause the display system of the da Vinci projects the image in the direction of the surgeon's hands, the optically correct hand-eye coordination is restored. This is more difficult with laparoscopy, in which the camera is sometimes offset to the plane of dissection.\n\nThe 11-mm telescope in the da Vinci system is a combination of two 5-mm optical channels (one for the right eye and one for the left eye), which have 2 separate 3-chip–charged coupling devices in the camera head. The 2 images are displayed to provide 3-dimensional (3-D) stereoscopic vision to the surgeon, providing depth perception lacking in laparoscopy. The conventional laparoscopic technique does not provide a 3-D depth of view.\n\nThe movements of the robotic system are intuitive (ie, a movement of the master control to the right causes the instrument to move to the right), as opposed to the counterintuitive movements in laparoscopy with fulcrum movement effects (ie, movement of the laparoscopic instrument to the right by the surgeon causes the tip of the instrument to move to the left inside the patient's body).\n\nThe robotic systems provide increased precision by filtering hand tremors, providing magnification (10X or 15X), and providing scaling for the surgeon's movements (a 1:3 scaling means that a 3-in movement of the master is translated into a 1-in movement of the instrument tip).\n\nThe robotic instruments have articulated tips, which permit 7° of freedom in movements (ie, they mimic human wrist movements, including rotation), which is unlike laparoscopy, with which only 4° of freedom are permitted.\n\nDisadvantages of robotic techniques\n\nRobotic techniques also have disadvantages. The current-generation robot is still bulky and tends to limit the working space of the assistant(s). The availability of instrumentation for the robotic systems is presently limited, although development of new instruments is ongoing. Economically, the robotic system is viable only for centers with a high volume of cases or multidisciplinary robotic use. The system cost exceeds $1.2 million, and the annual maintenance costs range from $100,000 to $150,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nLaparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection (LPLND) is used in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer as well as bladder, penile, and urethral malignancies. The goal of LPLND in prostate cancer is to exclude high-risk patients from noncurative therapy and to stage high-risk patients at the time of prostatectomy.\n [1, 2]  Pelvic lymphadenectomy remains the criterion standard for detecting metastatic spread to the pelvic lymph nodes.\n [3] \nOverview of prostate cancer pelvic lymphadenectomy\nThe introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement as a screening test for prostate cancer created a dramatic shift or stage migration, which led to the diagnosis of prostate cancer in earlier stages of the disease. As a result, more patients are undergoing a variety of treatments for prostate cancer, including radical prostatectomy (open, laparoscopic, robotic), brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), cryosurgery, microwave thermotherapy, and high-frequency ultrasound therapy.\n\n\nBecause the stage at the time of diagnosis is typically lower, the need for pelvic lymphadenectomy in staging patients with prostate cancer has decreased. Nevertheless, pelvic lymphadenectomy remains an important piece of the cancer armamentarium for urologic surgeons. The principles outlined in this article are also pertinent to robotic laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, which is commonly performed at the time of laparoscopic or robotic prostatectomy.\n\n\n\n\nDespite refinements in surgical technique, radical prostatectomy remains an operative procedure that is associated with significant morbidity. Complications, including urinary incontinence, impotence, and fecal incontinence,\n [4]  dictate a conservative approach in patients shown to have metastatic disease. In addition, decisions concerning nonsurgical treatment of prostate cancer using external beam radiation, brachytherapy, or adjuvant hormonal therapy may be altered in patients with microscopic metastatic disease. Thus, the goal of LPLND is to exclude high-risk patients from noncurative therapy and to stage high-risk patients at the time of prostatectomy performed robotically or laparoscopically.\nSince the establishment of LPLND as a staging procedure in patients with prostate cancer, indications have been expanded to include the staging of bladder, penile and urethral malignancies.\n [5, 6] In these other types of genitourinary cancers, the presence of metastatic disease also has a tremendous impact on therapeutic choices.\n\n\n\n\nThe following image illustrates 2 examples of port placement in LPLND.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo variations of port placement are used commonly, the diamond and the fan configurations. In the diamond configuration (left), two 10-mm trocars are used. One is placed at the umbilicus, and the second is placed approximately 4-6 cm above the symphysis pubis in the midline. Two additional 5-mm trocars are used, one near the McBurney point in the midclavicular line on both sides. In the fan position (right), 5 trocars are used. A 10-mm trocar is placed at the umbilicus for the laparoscope. A second 10-mm trocar is placed on the left side, and a 5-mm trocar is placed on the right side at the level of the umbilicus, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, in line with the anterior superior iliac crest. Two additional 5-mm trocars are placed laterally, midway between the umbilicus and the symphysis pubis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nSee Prostate Cancer, Prostate-Specific Antigen, and Laparoscopic and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy for more information on these topics.\n\nIndications for pelvic imaging studies\nNoninvasive imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) can be useful in the diagnosis of metastatic disease in numerous malignancies. However, these imaging modalities are inadequate to reliably diagnose pelvic lymph node involvement in most patients with prostate cancer and can yield false-positive findings in the setting of infection or inflammation of the prostate after biopsy.\n [7, 8] \n\nThe utility of capromab pendetide imaging in the management and staging of prostate cancer continues to be explored.\n [9] The appropriate techniques for obtaining images, the clinical indications, and its use in clinical staging of the pelvic spread of prostate cancer are still being optimized. Once additional information is gathered through careful clinical trials, capromab pendetide scans may be a complementary diagnostic tool to PSA levels, Gleason score determined by prostate biopsy findings, and digital rectal examination.\n\nHacker et al evaluated the use of fluorocholine combined in-line PET-CT scanning in patients with a PSA level of more than 10 ng/mL, Gleason sum greater than 7, and negative bone scan findings and found that PET scanning was not useful in detecting occult lymph node metastasis in clinically localized prostate cancer.\n [10] \n\nHruby et al investigated whether visualization of the prostate drainage system with free indocyanine green would identify more lymph node metastases than super-extended pelvic lymph node dissection in intermediate- and high-risk patients with prostate cancer. The authors reported that fluorescence-targeted pelvic lymph node dissection allows for the lymphatic drainage of the prostate to be identified with great reliability. They concluded that since only the nodes draining the prostate are removed, the absolute number of removed nodes is decreased while diagnostic accuracy is increased.\n [11] \n\nIndications for pelvic lymphadenectomy\nPelvic lymphadenectomy remains the criterion standard for detecting metastatic spread to the pelvic lymph nodes.\n [12]  The indications for staging pelvic lymphadenectomy before prostatectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPrebiopsy serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level greater than 20 ng/mL\n\n\n\n\nGleason sum equal to 8 or greater\n\n\n\n\nFive or more positive systematic sextant biopsies or total linear involvement of 28% or more\n\n\n\n\nPalpably advanced local disease, clinical stages T3 and T4\n\n\n\n\nPositive seminal vesicle biopsy\n\n\n\n\nEnlargement of pelvic lymph nodes as evident on pelvic imaging\n\n\n\nPartin tables\nUsing standard nomograms, such as the Partin tables below, we can predict that 24-51% of patients with a PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL and a Gleason sum of 8-10 will have nodal disease and would not be candidates for curative resection.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Wyler et al conducted a retrospective review of 123 patients with organ-confined high-risk prostate cancer who underwent LPLND at the time of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and concluded that LPLND should still be used in patients at high risk for metastasis.\n [14] In this series, the mean PSA level was 15 ng/mL and the mean Gleason score was 4+3. The investigators found that 17% of patients had lymph node metastases, and the overall complication rate was 4%.\n\nGenitourinary malignancies including bladder, penile, and urethral cancer\nOther genitourinary malignancies that require pelvic lymphadenectomy often need a more extensive nodal dissection that includes removing the common iliac, external iliac, and obturator lymph nodes.\n [15] Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with lymphatic spread often has an aggressive clinical course. As with prostate cancer, noninvasive techniques to determine nodal status are inadequate, and pelvic lymphadenectomy is the most accurate way to definitively establish the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes.\n\nGiven the poor survival rate in patients with aggressive bladder cancer, those with enlarged lymph nodes on pelvic imaging studies may be candidates for laparoscopic staging before radical cystoprostatectomy. Patients who choose bladder-sparing treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or partial cystectomy and those who desire orthotopic neobladder construction may also benefit from staging LPLND.\n\nCarcinoma of the penis has a characteristic pattern of nodal spread depending on the location and depth of the primary lesion.\n [16] Laparoscopic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy may be used in the initial staging of penile cancer.\n [17] \n\nLPLND in the staging of urethral cancer has been recommended for patients who meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiologic evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy not accessible to fine-needle aspiration biopsy\n\n\n\n\nPreceding exenterative surgery in tumors of the proximal urethra\n\n\n\n\nLocally invasive distal urethral lesions\n\n\n\nThe use of laparoscopic pelvic node dissection for bladder cancer, urethral cancer, and penile cancer continues to develop, and further study is necessary to establish definitive indications.\n\nContraindications to LPLND\nContraindications to LPLND include severe cardiopulmonary disease, bowel obstruction, active infection, and uncorrected coagulopathy.\n\nConditions that may be considered relative contraindications include morbid obesity, previous abdominal surgery, hiatal hernia, history of pelvic fractures, hip replacement, and large pelvic or intra-abdominal masses. Relative contraindications are related to the surgeon's experience with laparoscopic surgery and LPLND.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Manual Detorsion of the Testes": "\nOverview\n\n\nTorsion of the testes is a surgical emergency, because it causes strangulation of gonadal blood supply with subsequent testicular necrosis and atrophy.\n [1, 2] Acute scrotal swelling in children indicates torsion of the testes until proven otherwise.\nTesticular torsion is a true urologic emergency; a delay in diagnosis and management can lead to loss of the testicle. In approximately two thirds of patients, the history and physical examination are sufficient to make an accurate diagnosis. If testicular torsion is suspected, notify a surgeon, urologist, or pediatric surgeon and arrange for diagnostic imaging to make a definitive diagnosis as soon as possible. In adolescent males, testicular torsion is the most frequent cause of testicle loss.\n\n\nTesticular torsion occurs more commonly in patients who have an inappropriately high attachment of the tunica vaginalis. This allows the testicle to rotate freely on the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis (intravaginal testicular torsion). This congenital anomaly is called the bell clapper deformity and results in the long axis of the testicle becoming oriented transversely rather than cephalocaudal, as shown in the image below. The bell clapper deformity is present in approximately 12% of males; 40% of them are affected in both testicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal testis (left). Bell clapper deformity (right), a congenital condition in which the testis hangs within the scrotum (red arrows) and can swing like a bell clapper in a bell, allowing for easy torsion. Males born with the bell clapper deformity have no attachments around either testicle, so that torsion can potentially occur on either side. Bilateral testicular torsion, however, is an exceedingly rare event. \n\n\n\n\n\nExtravaginal testicular torsion that occurs in newborns cannot be treated by manual detorsion. The incidence of perinatal testicular torsion is 6.1 in 100,000 live births.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nTesticular torsion is commonly observed in males younger than 30 years, with a peak at 12-18 years. The incidence of torsion in males younger than 25 years is approximately 1 in 4000.\n [4] Torsion more often involves the left testicle. The etiologic factors involved in intravaginal testicular torsion include congenital anomaly, bell clapper deformity, undescended testicle, sexual arousal or activity, exercise, active cremasteric reflex, and cold weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nephrostomy": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nNephrostomy is a term used to describe a passageway maintained by a tube, stent, or catheter that perforates the skin, passes through the body wall and renal parenchyma, and terminates in the renal pelvis or a calyx.\nThe nephrostomy has multiple functions but is used most frequently to provide urinary drainage when the ureter is obstructed and retrograde access is inadvisable or impossible. A nephrostomy can also be used to gain access to the upper urinary tract for various antegrade endourologic procedures, such as intracorporeal lithotripsy, chemical stone dissolution, antegrade radiologic studies of the ureter, and double-J stent placement.\n\n\nNephrostomy has several other functions, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo remove or dissolve renal calculi\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain direct access to the upper urinary tract for various endourologic procedures\n\n\n\n\nTo diagnose ureteral obstruction, filling defects, and anomalies via antegrade radiography\n\n\n\n\nTo deliver chemotherapeutic agents to the renal collecting system\n\n\n\n\nTo provide prophylaxis after resection for local chemotherapy in patients with tumors of the renal pelvis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn assessment of blood serum creatinine can be used to help evaluate obstruction and dilatation of the renal pelvis. Elevated levels indicate that the renal pelvis obstruction is related to kidney function. However, in all patients, nephrotoxic substances should be excluded as a source of renal failure. A renal scan is helpful in borderline cases (ie, when the renal pelvis is normal or minimally dilated and the creatinine level is slightly elevated).\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether an obstruction is new or old, the patient's history is essential. Old radiographs or sonograms can also be helpful. Most commonly, acute obstruction is caused by renal stones, whereas chronic obstruction is caused by renal or ureteral tumors and postoperative and radiation strictures of the ureter. A prior instance of renal failure was usually due to chronic obstruction.\n\nThe most dangerous cases of renal obstruction occur in patients who have urosepsis with renal obstruction and elevated creatinine levels. Fast renal access can be lifesaving in these patients. However, as with any procedure, the patient's general situation and prognosis must be evaluated prior to the procedure.\n\nTumors, such as sarcomas, ovarian tumors, and other retroperitoneal tumors (Ormond disease, intraperitoneal tumors), can compress the ureter. A nephrostomy may be required in all of these cases. Do not attempt retrograde access if a tumor spill or vascular lesion is likely to develop. Depending on the anatomical situation of the stricture, patients with ureteral strictures after vascular surgery, eg, for an aortofemoral bypass, should undergo nephrostomy placement.\n\nAnatomical anomalies, such as ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, can create difficulty in retrograde access. Tumors or strictures that completely compress the ureter complicate or prevent retrograde access to the kidney. Passing a stent or guidewire antegrade rather than retrograde can be easier, as cystoscopy is not needed for antegrade access to the ureter.\n\nFlexible antegrade pyeloureteroscopy can be performed through the nephrostomy when retrograde access to the ureter or kidney is not possible because of anatomic anomalies, tumors, or strictures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Cases of paraphimosis as a complication of monkeypox (mpox) have also been reported.\n [6, 7] \nPatients present with a red, painful, and swollen glans penis associated with an edematous, proximally retracted foreskin that forms a circumferential constricting band.

        "Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nPelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) has a role in the treatment of several genitourinary cancers but is most commonly used in bladder cancer and prostate cancer. Others include urethral cancer and penile cancer. PLND has an additional role in the management of gynecologic cancers and other pelvic malignancies. While the anatomic approach is similar, the focus of this article is urologic indications.\n\n\nHistory of the procedure\nAfter it had been demonstrated that patients with breast and colon cancer with lymph node metastases could be cured surgically, attempts were made to apply lymphadenectomy to cancers of the pelvic organs. In 1932, Godard and Kaliopoulos reported pelvic lymphadenectomy with total cystectomy for bladder cancer. In 1950, Leadbetter and Cooper also were proponents of pelvic lymphadenectomy with cystectomy for bladder cancer.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nThe principal urologic indications for PLND occur in bladder cancer and in prostate cancer. Other urologic scenarios in which PLND is performed include selected cases of urethral and penile cancer.\n\n\n\n\nBladder cancer\nIn bladder cancer, pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is performed at the time of a radical cystectomy or a partial cystectomy. For these patients, PLND provides staging information and can be therapeutic. Several studies, including by Skinner\n [1] and Vieweg et al,\n [2] have confirmed that patients with pelvic lymph node metastases can be cured with PLND during radical cystectomy. However, the curability seemed to hold for organ-confined cancer (pathologic T stage 2) but not for non–organ-confined cancer (pathologic T stage 3).\n [3] \n\nFor more information go to Bladder Cancer.\n\nProstate cancer\nThe decision to perform PLND for prostate cancer prior to performing radical retropubic prostatectomy is based on the probability of pelvic lymph node metastases. This can be determined using the Partin nomograms.\n [4] The Partin nomograms are included in the tables below (these and other nomograms are available at the Prediction Tools Page of MSKCC.org).\n\nFor more information, go to Prostate Cancer.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For an open retropubic prostatectomy, PLND adds minimal morbidity. Therefore, a 3% probability of lymph node involvement is used as a threshold above which one would perform a PLND.\n\nFor a perineal prostatectomy, PLND requires an extra operation, and a 10% cutoff is used. In patients who undergo external beam radiation therapy and who may benefit from radiation as treatment for microscopic pelvic lymph node–positive disease, a 35% cutoff is used.\n\nA study by Moschini et al reported that in pT3-T4 prostate cancer patients, removal of a higher number of lymph nodes during radical prostatectomy was associated with higher cancer-specific survival rates. The authors added that this study supported the role of more extensive PLND in this patient group, however, further studies are needed to validate these findings.\n [5, 6] \n\nA systematic review by Fossati et al that included 66 studies and 275,269 patients suggested that although the quality of data was poor, pelvic lymph node dissection in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer may not have any direct benefit on cancer outcomes and may result in greater adverse outcomes. However, PLND remains acceptable because of its accurate assessment of cancer metastasis. Further studies are needed.\n [7] \n\nPenile cancer\nPelvic lymphadenectomy in the setting of penile cancer is controversial. However, an argument can be made that PLND is a reasonable therapy for a young patient, given that some evidence shows that pelvic lymphadenectomy may lengthen survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy should also be considered if pelvic lymph nodes are positive.\n\nUrethral cancer\nPrimary cancers of the entire urethra or posterior urethra in females and in the bulbomembranous urethra in males are usually associated with invasion and a high incidence of pelvic nodal metastases. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed along with exenterative surgery because, occasionally, patients with nodal metastases can be cured.\n\nUrethral carcinoma in male patients is classified into 3 groups based on the location of the lesion: (1) penile, (2) bulbomembranous, or (3) prostatic. Most cases (59%) occur posteriorly and involve the bulbomembranous urethra. Less frequent sites include the penile (33%) and the prostatic (7%) portions. In women, approximately 50% of carcinomas occur in the distal urethra.\n\nLymphatic metastases in the inguinal lymph nodes typically result from tumor in the anterior urethra, while pelvic lymphatic metastases are associated with posterior urethral tumors. Like its male counterpart, the female urethra has an anterior portion that comprises the distal one third of the urethra and a posterior portion that comprises the remaining proximal two thirds. The distal third drains into the inguinal nodes, and the proximal two thirds empty into the pelvic lymph nodes.\n\nContraindications\nMetastatic prostate cancer that involves the pelvic lymph nodes is generally considered to be incurable with surgery. In such cases, PLND cannot be undertaken as a therapeutic procedure; instead, its purpose is to accurately determine whether the patient would benefit from more aggressive, definitive therapy. Essentially, the PLND is a staging procedure that can prevent the morbidity of a radical prostatectomy in patients unlikely to benefit from the procedure.\n\nPelvic lymphadenectomy in the setting of penile cancer is controversial. General agreement indicates that the probability of finding positive pelvic lymph nodes is increased in the presence of positive inguinal lymph nodes. Also known is the fact that survival of patients with positive iliac nodes is limited. Therefore, some would argue against PLND for penile cancer.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThere are 8-10 external iliac lymph nodes. These receive efferent lymphatics from the inguinal nodes, the lymphatics of the iliac fossa, and the lower anterior abdominal wall and afferent lymphatics from the pelvic viscera\n\nThe internal iliac lymph nodes receive afferents from the pelvic viscera. Their efferents pass to the common iliac nodes.\n\nThere are 4-6 common iliac nodes whose efferent lymphatics pass to the lumbar nodes.\n\nThe lymphatics of the pelvis follow the arteries, and the group of nodes accompanying each is named accordingly: internal iliac, external iliac, and common iliac.

        "Penile Biopsy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nPenile biopsy is used to diagnose benign and malignant lesions of the penis. The technique used varies with the size and location of the lesion and may include punch biopsy or incisional/excisional biopsy.\n\n\nIndications\nPenile biopsy is often performed for the diagnosis of suspected penile caner (see image below). A biopsy is performed to provide histologic confirmation of penile cancer and to assess the depth of microscopic invasion. In the setting of benign lesions, penile biopsy may be performed to identify the etiology of the lesion to guide treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nPenile biopsy should not be performed in a patient who is taking anticoagulants or other blood thinners, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe penile shaft is composed of 3 erectile columns, the 2 corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum, as well as the columns' enveloping fascial layers, nerves, lymphatics, and blood vessels, all covered by skin. The 2 suspensory ligaments, composed of primarily elastic fibers, support the penis at its base. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Penis Anatomy.\n\nTechnical considerations\nThe type of biopsy performed varies with the size and location of the lesion and the suspicion of malignant disease. For lesions suspicious for cancer, various biopsy techniques may be used, including wet preparation cytology or punch biopsy for suspected carcinoma-in-situ, incisional biopsy for lesions on the shaft of the penis, and excisional biopsy for those involving the prepuce. Incisional biopsy provides the best information regarding the depth of tumor penetration and helps avoid clinical understaging.\n [1] For those lesions that are thought to be benign in nature, treatment is best accomplished with local excision and thorough histologic evaluation to rule out malignancy. If malignancy is highly suspected, an intraoperative frozen section may be performed for confirmation of malignancy followed by partial or total penectomy, depending on the size, location, and depth of penetration of the cancer.\n\nProcedure planning\nThe type of biopsy performed should be predetermined to ensure that the appropriate equipment is available. Similarly, if partial/total penectomy is being considered at the time of the biopsy, the consent needs to include such procedures, and the pathology department should be notified of the need for frozen section results. Patients who are taking anticoagulants and/or other blood thinners should stop therapy in advance of surgery to minimize the risk of bleeding.\n\nAnesthesia\nPenile biopsy may be performed under local anesthesia (penile block) depending on the size of the lesion and whether or not partial/total penectomy will be performed if the frozen section biopsy is positive.\n\nComplication prevention\nTo avoid significant bleeding, anticoagulant therapy and other agents that affect hemostasis (ie, NSAIDs) should be stopped prior to the procedure. If infection is present at the site of biopsy, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be instituted prior to biopsy. The biopsy site should be prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Except for small punch biopsies, suture closure is recommended for cosmesis and hemostasis. The specimen should be large enough to ensure sufficient evaluation. Confirmation of the adequacy of the specimen with pathology should be obtained prior to termination of the procedure. A penile block placed at the beginning of the procedure helps decrease periprocedural pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Penile Injection and Aspiration": "\nOverview\n\n\nPriapism is defined as erection that lasts longer than 6 hours. Such a prolonged erection causes physiological changes by 6 hours, cellular damage by 24 hours, and fibrosis by 36 hours, resulting in permanent erectile dysfunction.\nLow-flow (ischemic) priapism is the more common form of priapism.\n [1] Causes of low-flow priapism fall into the following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nIdiopathic\n\n\n\n\nHematologic (eg, sickle cell, leukemia)\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic – Adverse effects (eg, psychiatric medications)\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic – Therapeutic (eg, oral erectile medications, intracavernous injections)\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nNeoplastic\n\n\n\n\nOthers (eg, surgical, traumatic, neurogenic, infectious)\n\n\n\n\nManagement of ischemic priapism should achieve resolution as promptly as possible. Initial treatment is therapeutic aspiration with or without irrigation of the corpora. If this fails, intracavernous injection of sympathomimetic drugs is the next step.\n [5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nHigh-flow priapism is rare and is usually a result of blunt trauma to the corpora cavernosus resulting in arteriovenous fistula. The treatment for high-flow priapism is surgical and is not discussed in this article.\n [7] \nRelevant anatomy\nThe erectile tissue within the corpora contains arteries, nerves, muscle fibers, and venous sinuses lined with flat endothelial cells, and it fills the space of the corpora cavernosa. The cut surface of the corpora cavernosa looks like a sponge. There is a thin layer of areolar tissue that separates this tissue from the tunica albuginea. Blood flow to the corpora cavernosa is via the paired deep arteries of the penis (cavernosal arteries), which run near the center of each corpora cavernosa.

        "Percutaneous Nephrostomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nPercutaneous nephrostomy, or nephropyelostomy, is an interventional procedure that is used mainly in the decompression of the renal collecting system. Since the publication of the first report describing this procedure in 1955,\n [1] percutaneous nephrostomy catheter placement has been the primary option for temporary and at times long term drainage of an obstructed collecting system.\n [2, 3, 4] \nWith proper training, technical success is achieved in more than 95% of cases.\n [5] Diagnostic imaging often demonstrates the level and cause of obstruction; however, at the time of the catheter placement, the cause of obstruction may not be known. Often, the ureteral obstruction is acute and is caused by ureteral calculi or traumatic ureteral injury. In some cases, the obstruction has a chronic cause, such as urothelial malignancy or extrinsic compression associated with bleeding or neoplasm.\n\n\nFrequently, the obstructed system becomes infected, and antibiotics are unable to penetrate the kidney when the purulent material cannot be drained. In these cases, percutaneous nephrostomy is an attractive treatment alternative. It allows decompression of the obstructed system, permits specimen collection, and creates a route for antibiotic instillation if needed. This procedure decreases the risk of urosepsis associated with acute surgical intervention. Often, patients may avoid surgery because the obstructing calculus spontaneously passes after the edema within the ureter subsides. If the obstruction is the result of postoperative edema, percutaneous nephrostomy allows the edema to subside. Percutaneous nephrostomy may similarly facilitate the management of urinary fistulas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Perineal Abscess Drainage": "\nPre-Procedure\n\n\nBackground\nAn abscess is an infectious process characterized by a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue.\n [1, 2] Abscesses can form anywhere in the body, from a superficial skin (subcutaneous) abscess to deep abscesses in muscle, organs, or body cavities. Patients with subcutaneous skin abscesses present clinically as a firm, localized, painful, erythematous swelling that becomes fluctuant (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrotal abscess. \n\nThe abscess cavity is formed by necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and is filled with debris from surrounding tissue, white blood cells, blood and plasma products, and bacteria. The wall of the abscess is made up of dermis infiltrated with inflammatory cells surrounded by a fibrinous capsule.\n [1] Fevers, chills, and other constitutional symptoms are usually absent unless the infection has spread to deep tissues or into the bloodstream.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nAn abscess must be distinguished from cellulitis as treatment differs between the two. In contrast to an abscess, soft tissue affected by cellulitis is viable with intact blood supply. The infection usually affects more superficial tissue. Cellulitis resolves with appropriate antibiotic treatment alone if initiated before tissue necrosis occurs. A deep abscess can be mistaken for cellulitis as fluctuance may be harder to appreciate.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of an abscess is always drainage; the infection will not resolve unless the pus is drained. The abscess cavity is avascular and therefore antibiotic treatment alone will not resolve the infection.\n [1, 3] If left untreated, an abscess can progress in involve deeper tissue and has the potential to develop into a life-threatening, systemic infection.\n\nFormation of subcutaneous abscesses can occur anywhere on the body but frequently occurs in intertriginous, hair-bearing areas, such as the groin. It is usually the result of direct extension of an infection of the dermis or epidermis (ie, furuncle, carbuncle, folliculitis, cellulitis) by normal skin flora.\n [4, 2] Perineal abscesses are typically polymicrobial containing mixed aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative organisms. Common organisms include Staphylococcus aureus and group A ß-hemolytic streptococci (normal skin flora isolated at all body sites) and enteric gram-negative bacilli and Bacteroides fragilis group (gastrointestinal flora).\n [1, 4, 5] \n\nIndications\nDrainage is indicated for any subcutaneous infection with a fluid-filled, necrotic central cavity. There are no contraindications.\n\nAnesthesia\nMany abscesses can be drained at the bedside under local anesthesia. Typical anesthetic agents include ¼% Marcaine or 1% lidocaine with or without epinephrine. Epinephrine can be used to decrease the amount of bleeding at the incision site. Inject the skin surrounding the abscess cavity instead of the cavity itself. Injecting anesthetic into the abscess cavity will result in inadequate anesthesia.\n\nIn cases in which the extent of the abscess cavity cannot be elucidated at bedside, or where the pain is too great to perform drainage under local anesthesia, examination and drainage in the operating room under sedation or general anesthesia is necessary.\n\nPersonal protective equipment\n\n\n\n\n\nGloves\n\n\n\n\nFace shield\n\n\n\n\nGown\n\n\n\nAnesthetic\n\n\n\n\n\nTopical anesthetic\n\n\n\n\nSyringe, 10 mL\n\n\n\n\nNeedle, 27 gauge\n\n\n\n\nNeedle, 18 gauge\n\n\n\nSite preparation\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin prep\n\n\n\n\nSterile towels\n\n\n\nInstruments\n\n\n\n\n\nScalpel\n\n\n\n\nForceps\n\n\n\n\nSwabs for wound culture\n\n\n\n\nIrrigation\n\n\n\n\nSterile gauze for packing\n\n\n\nPositioning\nPosition is determined by location.

        "Perioperative Management of the Patient With Chronic Renal Failure": "\nOverview\n\n\nImpairment of the excretory function of the kidney results in an elevation in levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and various protein metabolic products. Impairment in the synthetic function results in a decrease in the production of erythropoietin (causing anemia) and active vitamin D-3 (causing hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, and renal osteodystrophy). Impairment in synthetic function also results in a reduction in acid, potassium, salt, and water excretion (causing acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and edema) and in platelet dysfunction (promoting bleeding).\nThe aforementioned complications must be identified and corrected perioperatively.\n [1] In addition, drugs normally excreted by the kidney can accumulate to toxic levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, adjusting dosages or avoiding such drugs, including iodinated contrast in high-risk patients, is a key management principle in patients with CKD. Of note is the avoidance of meperidine in patients with CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) because the active metabolite (normeperidine) can accumulate and cause seizures.\n\n\nCKD can be associated with excess surgical morbidity, the most important of which include acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, volume overload, and infections.\n [2, 3] The above underscore the need for early involvement of a nephrologist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

A disadvantage of peritoneal dialysis is the poor blood pressure control due to fluid overload as well as the risk of peritonitis.\n [3] \n\n\nAn image depicting peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeritoneal dialysis catheter showing the double cuff catheter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Phimosis, Adult Circumcision, and Buried Penis": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nPhimosis\nPhimosis is defined as the inability of the prepuce (foreskin) to be retracted behind the glans penis in uncircumcised males. Depending on the situation, this condition may be considered either physiologic or pathologic. Physiologic, or congenital, phimosis is a normal condition of the newborn male. In 90% of cases, natural separation allows the foreskin to retract by age 3 years.  However, phimosis persisting into late adolescence or early adulthood need not be considered abnormal.\n\n\nThe entity of pathologic, or true, phimosis is far less common and can affect children or adults. This is associated with cicatricial scarring of the prepuce that is often white in appearance. Phimosis may occur after circumcision if redundant inner prepuce slides back over the glans, with subsequent cicatricial scarring and contraction. Adult phimosis (ie, pathologic or true phimosis) may be caused by poor hygiene or an underlying medical condition (eg, diabetes mellitus).\nUncomplicated pathologic phimosis is usually amenable to conservative medical treatment. Failure of medical treatment warrants surgical intervention, usually in the traditional form of a circumcision or preputioplasty.\n\n\n\n\nAdult circumcision\nAlthough phimosis is the most common indication for adult circumcision, other reported indications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nParaphimosis\n\n\n\n\n          Balanitis without phimosis\n         \n\n\n\n          Condyloma\n         \n\n\n\n          Redundant foreskin\n         \n\n\n\nBowen disease \n         \n\n\n\nCarcinoma \n         \n\n\n\nTrauma \n         \n\n\n\n          Disease prophylaxis (eg, HIV infection)\n         \n\n\n\n          Patient choice\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nStudies suggest that circumcised boys are at a lower risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). To put this in perspective, the approximate likelihood of a UTI occurring in the first year of life is 1 in 100 in uncircumcised boys and 1 in 1000 in circumcised boys.\n [1] A lower risk of malignancy is also reported in studies of circumcised men, although the incidence is also rare in uncircumcised men. Of note, this decreased risk seems to be associated only with infant circumcision and not with adult procedures.\n\nThe theory that circumcision contributes to prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) was encouraged by a 19th-century report of lower rates of syphilis in Jewish men. Studies have demonstrated that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including oncogenic HPV infection, is more prevalent in uncircumcised men, regardless of demographics and sexual history.\n [2]  \n\nCiting a link between the intact prepuce and sexually transmitted infection, some authorities have gone as far as suggesting that circumcision protects against prostate cancer.\n [3]  Additionally, controlled studies by Tobian et al have shown the efficacy of circumcision in reducing the incidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection, and a follow-up study suggested that it may protect female partners from acquisition in men already infected.\n [4, 5] \n\nMeta-analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials in South Africa,\n [6]  Kenya,\n [7]  and Uganda\n [8]  has demonstrated that circumcision decreases the risk of HIV infection among heterosexual men by nearly 60%.\n [9]  Data from a mathematical model suggest that routine circumcision in southern sub-Saharan Africa could prevent 2 million HIV infections over 10 years.\n [10]  \n\nThe results of theses studies led the World Health Organization (WHO) and Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS to recommended  the use of voluntary medical male circumcision (MMC) to fight the spread of HIV infection in countries with a low male circumcision prevalence rate and a high HIV prevalence rate.\n [11]  Analysis of population-based surveys conducted from 1999 through 2013 in 45 rural Uganda communities lent support to this initiative, with findings that MMC coverage increased from 19% to 39% with an associated decrease in HIV incidence from 1.25 to 0.84 per 100 person-years in males.\n [12]  Further evaluation of these trials has shown no deleterious effects on male erectile function or sexual satisfaction, and 97.1% of female partners reported no change or improved sexual enjoyment after circumcision of their male partner.\n [13] \n\nThe results of the African randomized trials also sparked speculative interest in male circumcision to reduce HIV infection in the United States, especially in areas such as New York City.\n [14]  Pask et al have suggested that the protective benefit of circumcision against HIV infection may result from removal of Langerhans cells and that enhanced keratinization conferred by topical estrogen may therefore represent an alternative to circumcision.\n [15] \n\nOther indications for circumcision exist. Genital lichen sclerosus appears to be a disease generally restricted to uncircumcised males and is often cured by circumcision.\n [16]  Additionally, removal of foreskin remnants has shown to be an effective modality in select patients with premature ejaculation.\n [17] \n\nBuried penis\nBuried penis is a true congenital disorder in which a penis of normal size lacks the proper sheath of skin and lies hidden beneath the integument of the abdomen, thigh, or scrotum. The literature, on occasion, also refers to this condition as a hidden or concealed penis. \n\nThis condition is usually identified in neonates or obese prepubertal boys; however, it can also be seen in adults and has been observed in both circumcised and uncircumcised individuals. Marginal cases may not be diagnosed until adulthood, when increased fat deposition accentuates the problem. In most congenital pediatric cases, the buried penis is self-limited. In untreated adults, however, the condition tends to worsen as the abdominal pannus continues to grow.\n\nOther conditions to consider include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Trapped penis is a condition in which the penis becomes inconspicuous secondary to a cicatricial scar, usually after overzealous circumcision. \n         \n\n\n\n          Webbed penis is characterized by obscuration of the penile shaft by scrotal skin webs at the penoscrotal junction. \n         \n\n\n\n          Micropenis (also known as \n          microphallus) represents a penis less than 2 standard deviations below the mean in length when measured in the stretched state. \n         \n\n\n\n          Diminutive penis is a penis that is small, malformed, or both secondary to \n          epispadias, \n          exstrophy, severe \n          hypospadias, chromosomal abnormalities, or intersex conditions.\n         \n\n\nFor patient education information, see the Men's Health Center, as well as Foreskin Problems and Circumcision.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Prostate Biopsy": "\nBackground\n\n\nThis topic addresses indications for, preparation for, and performance of prostate biopsy—in particular, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy of the prostate gland.\n [3] Although a number of different methods may be used to perform TRUS-guided prostate biopsy, the authors find that those described in this topic facilitate mastery of this procedure.\n\nThe basics of office-based procedures such as this are easily overlooked in urology training. Mastery of such seemingly simple procedures sometimes eludes the urology resident during times when the spotlight may be on major surgery. However, the increasing focus on office-based procedures, combined with the observation that large numbers of urologists now function primarily in an ambulatory setting, makes facility with such procedures an increasingly important part of urologic specialty care.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nA normal prostate gland (see the image below) is approximately 20 g in volume, 3 cm in length, 4 cm wide, and 2 cm in depth. As men get older, the prostate gland is variable in size secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The gland is located posterior to the pubic symphysis, superior to the perineal membrane, inferior to the bladder, and anterior to the rectum. The base of the prostate is in continuity with the bladder and the prostate ends at the apex before becoming the striated external urethral sphincter. The sphincter is a vertically oriented tubular sheath that surrounds the membranous urethra and prostate.

Simple nephrectomy is also indicated to treat renovascular hypertension due to noncorrectable renal artery disease or severe unilateral parenchymal damage caused by nephrosclerosis, pyelonephritis, reflux dysplasia, or congenital dysplasia of the kidney.\n\n\nRadical nephrectomy is the treatment of choice for localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In certain circumstances, radical nephrectomy is also indicated to treat locally advanced RCC and metastatic RCC.\nWith the advent and increasingly mainstream use of abdominal CT scanning and ultrasound imaging in recent years for various abdominal and, occasionally, chest complaints, incidental detection of RCC has increased in asymptomatic patients. Currently, more than 50% of RCC cases are detected incidentally. These tumors tend to be smaller and of lower stage, resulting in better survival rates, lower recurrence rates, and lower metastasis rates than RCC detected in symptomatic patients.

        "Radical Orchiectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA radical orchiectomy is one aspect of the definitive treatment of testicular cancer.\n\n\nTesticular cancer generally affects young men between puberty and age 35 years. Successful treatment incorporates a number of modalities, including radical orchiectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, and radiation.\n [1, 2] \nIndications\nA radical orchiectomy is indicated in the management of a suspected testicular tumor. A testicular tumor should be suspected in any patient with the physical findings of a painless, firm, and irregular mass arising from the testicle. Confirm this with Doppler ultrasonography of the scrotum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost cases of testicular tumors demonstrate hypoechoic hypervascular intratesticular lesions. Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and/or human chorionic gonadotropin should also suggest a testicular tumor (germ cell type).\n\nContraindications\nIn some patients with a testicular mass, causes other than a testicular tumor need to be excluded before radical orchiectomy is performed. For example, if a patient presents with testicular enlargement but a history consistent with an orchitis, then antibiotic therapy would be indicated prior to surgery.\n\nSimilarly, if a patient with a history of congenital adrenal hyperplasia presents with bilateral multifocal testicular masses, a frozen section biopsy would be indicated at the time of the operation to confirm that the lesions are hyperplastic nodules of adrenal rests rather than multiple germ cell tumors.\n\nA study that assessed the clinical outcome of testicular sex cord stromal tumors (TSCST) according to management and stage reported that testis-sparing surgery may be feasible and effective in case of small tumors.\n [3] Another study concluded that testis-sparing surgery performed for small testicular masses may represent a safe procedure with optimal results in terms of functional and oncologic end points.\n [4] \n\nOutcomes\nSeminoma\n\nAfter treatment with radical orchiectomy and external-beam radiation therapy, the 5-year disease-free survival rate is 98% for stage I tumors and 92-94% for stage IIA tumors. For higher-stage disease that has been treated with radical orchiectomy followed by chemotherapy, the 5-year disease-free survival rate is 35-75%.\n [5] \n\nNonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors\n\nFor stage I tumors, which are treated with radical orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, the 5-year survival rate is 96-100%.\n [6] For low-volume stage II disease, which is treated with radical orchiectomy and chemotherapy, the 5-year disease-free survival rate is 90%. For bulky stage II disease, which is treated with radical orchiectomy followed by chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, the 5-year disease-free survival rate is 55-80%.\n\nScrotal Violation\nInguinal orchiectomy is the standard treatment for suspected testicular carcinoma. Scrotal violations that occur during scrotal orchiectomy, open testicular biopsy, and fine-needle aspiration may compromise the patient’s prognosis. Thus, patients with a scrotal violation often are subjected to potentially morbid local therapies. In addition, surveillance protocols usually exclude patients with scrotal violations.\n\nMuch of the current bias in managing scrotal violation stems from a 1925 article by Dean, who reported a 24% local recurrence rate after simple orchiectomy.\n [7] However, the validity of this report has been questioned, and numerous articles have suggested that scrotal violation may not necessarily confer a worse prognosis.\n\nIn particular, 2 articles have addressed this issue. In 1995, Capelouto et al reviewed all published series of patients with testicular cancer in whom scrotal violation occurred.\n [8] They then performed a meta-analysis to choose a subset on the effect of scrotal violation on patient prognosis for critical analysis. Although the local recurrence rates among the scrotal violation studies contained statistically significant differences, the overall local recurrence rates were minimal (2.9% vs 0.4%, respectively). In all groups analyzed, the rates of distant recurrence and survival were statistically similar.\n\nIn 1995, Leibovitch et al published a retrospective review of 78 of 1,708 patients (4.6%) with nonseminomatous testis cancer who presented to Indiana University School of Medicine following scrotal violation.\n [9] The overall relapse rate among patients with pathological stage A disease associated with scrotal violation was increased. The finding was exclusively attributed to local recurrences in 7.7% of cases following scrotal violation, compared with no local recurrences in patients who underwent standard radical orchiectomy. However, the overall patient survival rate was comparable to that in patients without scrotal violation.\n\nInguinal orchiectomy and high spermatic cord ligation remain the standard of care for diagnosis and initial management of testicular cancer. Scrotal violation alone, without tumor contamination, does not impart a worse prognosis in patients with testicular cancer. In the absence of gross tumor spillage, close observation alone may be adequate management for scrotal violation. Therefore, consider local or systemic therapies only upon evidence of a local recurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer": "\nBackground\n\n\nWith the evolving techniques and improving knowledge of surgical anatomy, physicians can perform radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) with great efficacy and minimal morbidity. The procedure has evolved over the last several decades to remain an important approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.\nIn 1947, Millin introduced the retropubic approach to prostatectomy. The operation had 2 distinct advantages over radical perineal prostatectomy (RPP):\n\n\n\n\n\n          Urologists were more familiar with retropubic anatomy\n         \n\n\n\n          The retropubic approach permitted the performance of an extraperitoneal pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) for staging purposes\n         \n\n\n\nWalsh deserves much credit for pioneering the technique of nerve-sparing RRP.\n [1] Before anatomic characterization in the early 1980s and the description and anatomic characterization of the Santorini plexus, the operation was fraught with massive blood loss and morbidity.\n\n\n\n\nModifications in the technique of RRP and the introduction of the anatomic nerve-sparing method\n [2]  have dramatically decreased the frequency of the most worrisome associated morbidities—incontinence and impotence. As a consequence of these developments, most patients with prostate cancer have a high quality of life after undergoing radical prostatectomy.\nRRP has been the standard for the surgical approach.  However, the explosion of minimally invasive surgery has led to the search for less invasive treatment options and laparoscopic and robotic appear to provide equally efficacious surgical options in selected patients.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nPure laparoscopic radical prostatectomy has a steep learning curve and currently accounts for fewer than 1% of all prostatectomies in the United States. Laparoscopy was introduced to urology in the early 1990s, with the first series of laparoscopic retropubic prostatectomy reported by Schuessler et al in 1991.\n [3] Most studies indicate longer operating times for laparoscopic retropubic prostatectomy than for RRP and a longer learning curve, but the former consistently seems to yield significantly decreased estimated blood loss and transfusion rates. Laparoscopic retropubic prostatectomy is well tolerated and provides short-term oncologic and functional results that are comparable with those of RRP in the hands of experienced surgeons. \n\nRobotic technology began to be utilized more broadly after 2005 and the usage of a robot for RP increased from 4.5% in 2003 to 85.2% in 2009.\n [4] It offers many advantages over conventional laparoscopic retropubic prostatectomy, including 3-dimensional visualization, magnification, increased degrees of freedom, absence of the fulcrum effect, and robotic-wrist instrumentation. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) can potentially reduce the learning curve that even experienced surgeons face while performing laparoscopic retropubic prostatectomy. However, there are still situations where open RRP may provide benefit including in patients with previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, and more extensive cancers where tactile information is an advantage. \n\nFunctional recovery (potency and continence) after open RRP is high for experienced surgeons. However, the robotic approach provides equivalent outcomes in experienced hands.\n [5, 6] Oncologic outcomes appear similar in the shorter term for the majority of low and intermediate grade cancers when compared to open RRP.\n [7] \n\nMinimally invasive approaches provide excellent visualization of the anatomy, cause less pain, permit earlier discharge, and have equivalent oncologic efficacy. Nevertheless, a sound and fundamental knowledge of traditional open radical prostatectomy, with and without nerve sparing, remains a crucial component of the urologist's armamentarium.  When choosing an approach, a major feature is the urologist’s experience and comfort with the robotic or open approach.\n\nProstate cancer overview\nAdenocarcinoma of the prostate is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death in American males. A surge in the incidence of prostate cancer was noted in the 1980’s due to the wider use of the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, which has also changed trends in clinical and pathologic aspects of prostate cancer.\n [8] \n\nSince the advent of serum PSA testing, physicians have detected more prostate cancers at an earlier stage. From 1998 – 2011, there was a twofold increased incidence of low risk prostate cancer from 14 – 28% and more than twofold decrease in the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer form 25% - 11%. During the same time period, the percentage of T1c disease increased from 36 – 71%, PSA levels between 4 and 6 ng/ml increased from 24% to 38%; T2 tumors decreased from 39% to 20% and PSA between 8 and 10 ng/ml decreased from 24% to 15%.\n [9] \n\nIn 2008, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against PSA-based screening in men aged ≥ 75 years. This recommendation was expanded to include all men in 2012. In 2013, the American Urological Association also issued a guideline statement for not screening men over the age of 70 years. These recommendations had widespread ramifications on age stratified outcomes.  The exclusion of PSA screening saw a further increase in aggressive disease and higher mortality rates in men over the age of 70.\n [10] Since 2012, consequent to USPSTF recommendations, there was a decrease in PSA screening and a decrease in the incidence of early stage prostate cancer in men of all ages. However, there was a stage and grade migration, with more men presenting with advanced disease at presentation.\n [11] Subsequently the USPSTSF revised its recommendation to screen men between ages 55 to 69 years in 2017 based on physician’s discussion about potential benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)–based screening for prostate cancer.\n [12] \n\nThe incidence of small, lower risk well-differentiated prostate cancer increased in the early PSA era and almost half of the patients with this diagnosis are candidates for active surveillance (AS) in an attempt to avoid overtreatment and morbidity associated with surgery or radiation.\n [13] The selection of men for AS has been traditionally guided by clinicopathological features that indicate the patient presents with an organ confined, well-differentiated tumor. Using strict selection criteria, patients with a life expectancy > 10 years, T1c, PSA ≤ 10, Gleason ≤ 6, ≤ 2 positive biopsy cores, ≤ 50% cancer in any core, and PSAD < 0.15 would be eligible for AS. Recent studies have shown that including intermediate risk disease for AS (4 or fewer cores with GS 6 cancer and/or only 1 core of Gleason 3+4 cancer < 15%) did not adversely affect outcomes.\n [14] Discussion of risks and benefits of AS with patients and shared decision making is the key to successful surveillance.\n\nFifteen-year mortality of prostate cancer specific mortality rate based on contemporary multi-institutional data for pathological Gleason score 6 or less, 3+4, 4+3 and 8-10 was 0.2% to 1.2%, 4.2% to 6.5%, 6.6% to 11% and 26% to 37%.\n [15] The 15-year prostate cancer specific mortality risk was 0.8% to 1.5%, 2.9% to 10%, 15% to 27% and 22% to 30% for organ confined cancer, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node metastasis, respectively. \n\nIncidence\n\nIn the United States, prostate cancer, which is predominantly a disease of elderly men, is the second-most common malignancy in males. Worldwide, the incidence of prostate cancer varies, but in general, it is higher in Western developed countries. For example, African American men (in whom the incidence of prostate cancer is highest) are 200 times as likely to develop prostate cancer as are Chinese men living in Asia (in whom the incidence of prostate cancer is among the lowest in the world). As worldwide life expectancy increases, the absolute number of prostate cancer cases is expected to grow.\n\nMortality\n\nThe American Cancer Society has estimated that in 2021, approximately 248,530 new cases of prostate cancer would be diagnosed, and approximately 34,130 prostate cancer deaths would occur, generating a 1:7 ratio.\n [15]  In the United States, prostate cancer–related mortality is higher in Black men than in White men. According to 2014-2018 data, the death rate among Black men was 37.4 per 100,000 men per year, compared with 17.9 per 100,000 men per year among White men.\n [15] \n\nEnvironmental risk factors\n\nMigration studies have revealed increased prostate cancer rates among migrants who move from areas with low prevalence to areas of high prevalence. In one study, the incidence of prostate cancer in emigrants from Japan increased 4-9 times over the disease's incidence in Japan.\n [16] \n\nSuch studies suggest that environmental factors (eg, diet) play an important role in prostate cancer. Researchers have found a positive correlation between higher consumption of fat, especially animal fat, and a higher prostate-cancer death rate increasing relative risk by a factor of 1.6-1.9.\n\nExperts suggest certain dietary habits to lower the risk of prostate cancer. These include consumption of a low-fat, high-fiber diet, which lowers serum androgen levels. Researchers have investigated other dietary components, including selenium, lycopene, vitamin D, alpha-tocopherol, vitamin E, and large amounts of green tea, and have postulated that consumption of these substances may prevent prostate cancer. However, a recently concluded meta-analysis of 12 international prospective cohort studies concluded that there were no statistically significant associations for advanced prostate cancer or prostate cancer mortality with any food group (including total fruits and vegetables, total fruits, total vegetables, fruit and vegetable juice, cruciferous vegetables, and tomato products), nor specific fruit and vegetables. Pooled multivariable relative risks comparing the highest versus lowest quantiles across all fruit and vegetable exposures and prostate cancer outcomes ranged from 0.89 to 1.09.\n [17]   However, this does not discount the impact that diet may have in subsets of susceptible patients and research on the association of genetics, ethnicity and diet will likely generate impactful findings in the future.\n\nFamilial and genetic risk factors\n\nFamily history and genetics can play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer. Having a single first-degree relative with prostate cancer increases the risk of prostate cancer by a factor of 2.1-2.8. Having both a first-degree and a second-degree relative with prostate cancer increases the risk by a factor of 6.\n [18] \n\nResearchers have mapped prostate cancer susceptibility loci including HPC1 (1q24-25), involved in 33% of hereditary prostate cancer cases.\n [19] Indeed, testing is now available using a number of these susceptibility loci that can help predict an individual’s risk for prostate cancer development.\n [20] However, the interplay of environment and these loci are complex making use of this test for one individual less reliable.\n\nAn estimated 10% of prostate cancer is due to mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, HOXB13 and Lynch syndrome.\n [21] BRCA1 and 2 are associated with risk of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate cancers and melanoma. Families with BRCA2 mutations appear to harbor aggressive variants of prostate cancer.

        "Renal Biopsy": "\nBackground\n\n\nA renal biopsy is used to obtain a segment of renal tissue, usually through a needle or another surgical instrument. Analysis of this tissue is then used in the diagnosis of an underlying renal condition.\n\nIn native kidneys, biopsy is used to identify various renal diseases, especially glomerular or interstitial pathologies. It can also aid in the diagnosis of renal masses and malignancies, the most common being renal cell carcinoma.\n\nIn a transplanted kidney, renal biopsy is indicated when graft dysfunction ensues with a rise in serum creatinine. Renal biopsy aids in diagnosing graft rejection and helps guide treatment, as well as the response to treatment in some cases.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Retrograde Pyelography": "\nBackground\n\n\nRetrograde pyelography is used by many urologists to visualize the ureters and collecting system of the kidney. The procedure involves introducing contrast into the urinary system in a retrograde fashion with simultaneous imaging using dynamic fluoroscopy. This procedure is performed with cystoscopy by placement of an endoscopic camera via the urethra into the bladder.\nNormally, urine is produced in the kidney and travels down the ureter in an antegrade fashion and is then stored in the bladder. The term retrograde is used in reference to the direction the contrast is introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Nephrectomy": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nLaparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) was first performed by Clayman et al in 1991 and has since become a standard therapy for various renal lesions.\n [1] LN may be performed by a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach for the treatment of both benign and malignant conditions. Urologists have historically favored a retroperitoneal approach (RLN) when using open surgical interventions for both renal and adrenal lesions. By maintaining a retroperitoneal surgical field for infectious or malignant processes, the risk of peritonitis or peritoneal seeding was minimized. In addition, this approach helps control and efficiently drain any urinary leakage immediately after renal reconstructive procedures (eg, pyeloplasty, anatrophic nephrolithotomy with infundibuloplasty, partial nephrectomy). Thus, in the age of endoscopic procedures and laparoscopy, crafting surgical interventions that maintain an extraperitoneal surgical field was a natural extension. Ultimately, this evolved into surgical maneuvers that created a potential retroperitoneal space large enough to facilitate both extirpative and reconstructive procedures.\n [2, 3, 4] \nThe first retroperitoneoscopy was performed by Bartel et al in 1969 using a mediastinoscope.\n [5] In 1991, Gauer, the father of modern day retroperitoneoscopy, developed a reliable and effective technique to create a retroperitoneal working space by using a soft inflatable balloon dilator.\n [6, 7] His initial clinical series of RLNs performed in a series of Indian subjects defined both a safe and effective endoscopic approach to renal lesions. With current high-definition endoscopic imaging and complementary accessory instrumentation, retroperitoneal laparoscopic renal surgery is regularly performed for both extirpative and reconstructive renal surgery. This approach is particularly suited for radical nephrectomy. With all the advantages of maintaining an extraperitoneal surgical field, and with prompt access to the great vessels and renal vasculature, RLN provides excellent oncologic outcomes with minimal morbidity.\n\n\nIndications\nIn general, the indications for an extraperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy are similar to those for the intraperitoneal approach. Using a retroperitoneal approach has certain advantages over a traditional laparoscopic nephrectomy, which include prompt access to the great vessels and renal vasculature without requiring medial mobilization of solid viscus or bowel.\n\n\n\n\nThis is particularly beneficial in the morbidly obese patient, in those who have undergone previous abdominal surgery or radiation where intra-abdominal adhesions are expected, and when renal vascular anomalies and/or neovascularity associated with a tumor mass are expected based on preoperative radiographic imaging, for which early vascular control is essential.\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, because of the lack of bowel manipulation and irritating effects of carbon dioxide on the gastrointestinal tract, the incidence of postoperative ileus and time to refeeding is far less.\n\nAdditionally, the prompt access to the great vessels and renal hilum is particularly helpful when the retroperitoneum is distorted by such factors as lymphadenopathy and tumor neovascularity.\n\nRetroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy (RLN) is regularly performed for both benign and malignant lesions. The decision to perform simultaneous adrenalectomy and regional lymphadenectomy is individualized but is routinely performed using this approach.\n [8] Extraperitoneal laparoscopy has become the primary mode of access for adrenal lesions, including adrenal cortical carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. Renal tumor size, location, and radiographic or intraoperative evidence of lymphadenopathy do not prohibit using this procedure and are commonly facilitated by using a retroperitoneal procedure.\n\nFor the largest renal tumors, extraperitoneal extraction may be challenging. In those cases, initial retroperitoneal renal vasculature control with subsequent conversion to a transperitoneal dissection for tumor mobilization and specimen extraction is advantageous.\n\nRetroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy is also routinely performed for benign renal lesions. The term \"simple nephrectomy\" is a misnomer; removal of nonfunctioning hydronephrotic kidneys and kidneys associated with chronic pyelonephritis can reflect particularly challenging renal dissections.\n [9, 10] As with radical nephrectomy, early access to the major retroperitoneal structures is facilitated with retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy in this setting as well. In cases where renal infection and pyonephrosis are present, maintaining a retroperitoneal surgical field has the added advantage of localizing the infectious process to a contained space.\n\nLastly, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy can also be performed using a completely extraperitoneal approach, in which adequate length of the renal vessel for transplantation is facilitated by direct access to the aorta and vena cava.\n [11] \n\nOnce the technique is adequately mastered, the retroperitoneal approach is used for various surgical procedures, including nephroureterectomy,\n [12] partial nephrectomy,\n [13] pyeloplasty,\n [14] and adrenalectomy.\n [15] \n\nRelative disadvantages of the retroperitoneal approach include a smaller working space that makes large specimen entrapment and removal challenging, as well as marginally higher tissue absorption of the insufflation agent as compared with standard laparoscopy with associated hypercarbia. This, however, is usually clinically insignificant and the theory itself is being challenged by current studies (see Results, below).\n [16] \n\nWith improvements in robotic technology for surgery, laparoscopic robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RPN) has emerged as a preferred technique, with excellent short-term cancer and functional outcomes and decreased morbidity in selected patients. The robot offers 2 main advantages over conventional laparoscopy. First, the binocular camera allows the surgeon depth perception to easily operate in 3 dimensions. Second, the “wrist” of the robotic arms has 7 degrees of freedom, which allow the surgeon better control over certain aspects of the operation, most importantly precise suturing with minimal tissue manipulation. The technological advantages of robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy over conventional laparoscopy may allow novice surgeons a shorter learning curve.\n [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]  The most notable disadvantage of robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy is the added cost of purchasing and maintaining a surgical robot.\n [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] \n\nStudies have also been done comparing laparoscopic and robotic nephroureterectomy with good comparative results.\n [29, 26, 30, 31, 32, 27, 28] \n\nContraindications\nThere are no discreet contraindications specific to retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy. Indeed, many of the same conditions that prohibit any laparoscopic or open surgical intervention also apply to the retroperitoneal approach. Retroperitoneal access may be challenging in patients with prior retroperitoneal or percutaneous renal surgery and in patients with a history of pyelonephritis or genitourinary tuberculosis, which may lead to significant scarring and prevent adequate development of the retroperitoneum potential space required for renal dissection.\n\nCare should be used in patients with a history of abdominal aortic or iliac artery aneurysms in that these structures may be, in general, friable. In addition, the renal vasculature is often tortuous and distorted by a saccular aortic aneurysm. Intraoperative sonography with color Doppler using a 10-MHz laparoscopic probe is useful in defining complex renal vasculature in this and other settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nLocalized kidney cancer treatment overview\nKidney cancer (most commonly renal cell carcinoma) is one of the top ten commonly diagnosed cancers in men and women.\n [1] \n\n\nWhile the incidence of renal cell carcinoma is increasing, there is also an increased rate of cancer detection because of the common use of cross-sectional imaging. As a result, many cancers are detected at earlier stages,\n [2] increasing the available treatment options.\n [3] \nEvidence also shows that many small kidney cancers may be indolent and may progress slowly,\n [4] but there is no reliable method for predicting which patients will develop metastatic cancer. Although several systemic treatments have been developed in the last decade, the outcomes for metastatic renal cell carcinoma remain poor.\n [5] As a result, aggressive treatment is usually recommended in patients who do not have serious medical comorbidities.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nSurgery for localized renal cell carcinoma\nIn patients with renal cell carcinoma confined to the kidney (pathologic stage T1 or T2), surgery is effective treatment, with 5-year cancer-free rates of around 95% in large series.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nFor 5 decades, the recommended treatment was complete removal of the kidney (radical nephrectomy),\n [2] which was effective but associated with an increased risk of chronic renal failure.\n [3] \n\nHistorically, partial nephrectomy was not offered as a standard treatment to otherwise healthy patients but was reserved for patients with a solitary kidney, poor renal function, or bilateral tumors.\n [4] However, in the 1990s, preserving renal function by removing only the tumor was popularized and accepted for selected patients with small renal masses.\n\nTo date, the vast majority of studies have shown equivalent cancer control in patients treated with complete removal of the kidney or removal of the tumor only,\n [6] with only rare exceptions.\n [7] In the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for small renal masses, when technically feasible, partial nephrectomy is the standard option for treatment of tumors less than 4 cm in otherwise healthy patients.\n [8]  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends partial nephrectomy for a T1a renal mass, stating that radical nephrectomy should not be used when nephron-sparing approaches are possible. For T1b tumors, the NCCN guideline states that the standard of care is either radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy (when possible).\n [9] \n\nIn efforts to reduce the morbidity of open surgery, surgeons developed laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, with the initial large series showing excellent cancer-specific outcomes\n [10] but higher complication rates than open surgery.\n [11] \n\nOther techniques that limit the morbidity of treatment for small renal cell carcinomas include active surveillance and laparoscopic or percutaneous ablation (cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, and microwave ablation).\n [5] However, ablation techniques and surveillance have not demonstrated equivalent cancer outcomes to surgery and are not generally offered to otherwise healthy patients as first-line treatment.\n\nWith improvements in robotic technology for surgery, robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RPN) has emerged as a preferred technique, with excellent short-term cancer and functional outcomes and decreased morbidity in selected patients.\n [12] \n\nEvolution of minimally invasive surgery for kidney cancer\nOpen nephrectomy for kidney tumors can be performed through a flank, subcostal, or midline abdominal incision.\n\nThe kidneys are located in the retroperitoneum deep to the colon and other peritoneal organs that may require a larger incision for proper access. In the 1980s and 1990s, reports of the feasibility of laparoscopic renal surgery were published,\n [13, 14] with the first hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy performed in 1997.\n [15] \n\nLaparoscopic techniques allowed smaller incisions, reduced postoperative pain, and hastened recovery. Multiple series have now demonstrated excellent long-term cancer outcomes for laparoscopic nephrectomy.\n [16] As laparoscopic techniques evolved, several authors demonstrated the feasibility\n [17] and favorable outcomes with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.\n [18] \n\nWith the evolution of robotic technology for surgery, robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy has evolved as a technique that offers similar outcomes to laparoscopic or open techniques but that may have the advantage of improved maneuverability and precision to decrease ischemia times and improve postoperative renal function.\n [12] \n\nPotential advantages and disadvantages of robotic assistance\nThe kidneys filter 10%-20% of an individual’s blood volume per minute. Therefore, partial nephrectomy requires precise control for excision and prompt repair to minimize bleeding and to decrease ischemic time to the kidney.\n\nThe robot offers two main advantages over conventional laparoscopy. First, the binocular camera allows the surgeon depth perception to easily operate in 3 dimensions. Second, the “wrist” of the robotic arms has 7 degrees of freedom, which allow the surgeon better control over certain aspects of the operation, most importantly precise suturing with minimal tissue manipulation. The technological advantages of robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy over conventional laparoscopy may allow novice surgeons a shorter learning curve.\n [19] \n\nSeveral authors speculate that the technical difficulty of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy has precluded its widespread acceptance, whereas the technical improvements of robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy may allow even novice laparoscopic surgeons to safely perform minimally invasive partial nephrectomies.\n [20] \n\nThe most notable disadvantage of robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy is the added cost of purchasing and maintaining a surgical robot. In 2012, a new robot cost approximately $1.75 million, with a yearly service agreement of $150,000 (da Vinci Surgical System, Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). However, future research is needed to evaluate whether the increased cost of using the surgical robot may be offset by increased utilization of nephron-sparing surgery and better patient outcomes.\n [21, 22] \n\nHistory of robotics in urology\nThe first use of a surgical robot was in orthopaedics in 1983, and the first use of robotics for urologic surgery was in 1988. Initial robots in urology were designed for transurethral surgery, laparoscopic camera holding, or endoscopic applications.\n [23] In 2000, the da Vinci robotic surgical system was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and the first robotic prostatectomy was performed the same year.\n [24] Surgeons quickly adopted this technique, and, by 2007, it is estimated that 60%-70% of all prostatectomies were performed using robotic assistance.\n [25] \n\nFor kidney surgery, robot assistance has been used for various types of surgery but has particular application to partial nephrectomy\n [26] and pyeloplasty\n [27] because of the ease of laparoscopic suturing compared to conventional laparoscopy.\n\nOptimal patient selection for robotic assisted partial nephrectomy\nAs the understanding of renal cell carcinoma has evolved, the role of partial nephrectomy has expanded. Partial nephrectomy was originally offered only to patients with a solitary kidney, bilateral masses, or poor renal function. Gradually, partial nephrectomy became the standard of care among patients with renal masses smaller than 4 cm, and many surgeons argue that partial nephrectomy is currently the standard of care regardless of tumor size, when technically feasible.\n [28]  \n [29] \n\nWhen deciding whether partial nephrectomy is feasible, the ability to safely remove all tumor completely is the primary consideration. The position of the tumor within the kidney with respect to the blood vessels and collecting system are of paramount importance when considering partial nephrectomy. Multiple systems have been developed to help standardize and make this judgement more objective.\n [30, 31]  \n [32] \n\nThe use of robotic assistance may facilitate better control when excising tumors and faster repair of the defect when the tumor is removed. Ideal tumors for robotic excision are exophytic and smaller than 4 cm. Larger tumors and those closer to hilar vessels decrease the ability to successfully perform robotic partial nephrectomy. However, larger central tumors may also be removed robotically based on the location of the tumor and experience of the surgical team.\n [32, 29, 33] \n\nOther patient factors such as severe heart or lung disease may make the robotic approach less suitable.\n\nPreoperative screening\nPotential advantages of robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy include a 3-dimensional stereoscopic vision, articulating instruments, and scaled-down movements, reducing tremor. Such articulating instruments and increased freedom of movement may also allow the surgeon to quickly replicate the well-established open surgical maneuvers.\n [34] However, robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy is a technically challenging procedure because of the time constraints posed by hilar clamping. When the renal hilum is clamped, every minute of ischemia may decrease the patients subsequent renal function.\n [35] Therefore, the surgeon should be well versed with handling and troubleshooting the robotic interface.\n [36] \n\nThe preoperative screening for this relatively complex robot-assisted laparoscopic procedure is identical to that of a laparoscopic nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy. The evaluation is largely based on anesthesia risk and tumor stage, size, and location; any candidate suitable for a laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is suitable for a robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.\n\nPreoperative evaluation should include stratification of cardiovascular risks, serum laboratory studies, and 3-dimensional imaging (CT or MRI) to accurately delineate the relationship of the mass to the renal vasculature and collecting system.\n [37] The number of renal vessels and any aberrant vasculature should be noted and may be further delineated with MRI.\n\nPerioperative antibiotics may be given as per standard laparoscopic nephrectomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Pyeloplasty": "\nBackground\n\n\nThis topic reviews the technique and application of robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RLP). Open pyeloplasty has been the criterion standard for pyeloplasty, achieving excellent long-term success rates of over 90%,\n [1] despite the disadvantages of longer hospital stay, increased postoperative pain, and slower return to normal activities as compared with laparoscopic renal surgery.\n [2] \nTwo other forms of surgical options emerged offering minimally invasive techniques. The first was antegrade endopyelotomy through a percutaneous tract.\n [3, 4] The second was retrograde endopyelotomy, in which retrograde access is obtained by using fluoroscopy and small-caliber ureteroscopes.\n [5, 6] The main attraction of retrograde endopyelotomy is the avoidance of percutaneous access, which allows the procedure to be performed with less morbidity and a shorter inpatient convalescence period or none at all.\n [7] \n\n\nThe first laparoscopic pyeloplasty was reported in 1993.\n [8, 9] Many series showed that laparoscopic pyeloplasty was comparable to open pyeloplasty.\n [10, 11, 12] Long-term series with a minimum of 2 years’ follow-up reported excellent success rates (96-98%).\n [13, 4, 14] Laparoscopic pyeloplasty also achieved good success (eg, 83% in 36 patients) after previous failed procedures (eg, antegrade or retrograde endopyelotomy, balloon dilatation, and open pyeloplasty).\n [15] \nDespite the low morbidity of the procedure, the long-term results of endopyelotomy could not be compared with those of open or laparoscopic pyeloplasty.\n [16] The benefit of quick recovery from surgery after endopyelotomy could also be matched by the minimally invasive laparoscopic approach. For these reasons, endopyelotomy gradually took a smaller role in the first-line management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO).\n [17, 18] \n\n\n\n\nExcellent results notwithstanding, laparoscopic pyeloplasty did not replace open pyeloplasty the way laparoscopic nephrectomy replaced open nephrectomy—mainly because of the steep learning curve required to master advanced laparoscopic skills such as intracorporal suturing, which can be time-consuming and imprecise in the initial learning stages. The development of RLP has reduced the obstacles to learning intracorporeal suturing, which is the main reconstructive step in pyeloplasty. In 2009, RLP surpassed open surgery as the most widely used approach for pyeloplasty in the United States.\n [19] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

This condition is common, being symptomatic in approximately 30% of women 50-89 years of age and requiring a corrective procedure in 11% of women by 80 years of age.\n [2, 3] \nPOP occurs frequently with normal aging in women who have had vaginal delivery or deliveries or prior hysterectomy, and in those who have increasing body mass index, which predispose these women to weakening of the supporting ligaments and muscles in the pelvic floor.\n [1] \n\n\nThe prevalence of POP increases with age.\n [4] Researchers estimate that up to 250,000 surgical procedures to correct POP are performed each year in the United States,\n [5] and, as the proportion of older women continues to rise, the requirement for these procedures is expected to increase by approximately 50%.\n [6] \nSacrocolpopexy is a surgical technique used to treat vaginal vault or uterine prolapse, 2 types of POP. The objectives of the procedure are to reduce prolapse and to restore the anatomy and function of the vagina. During the procedure, the apex of the vagina/fundus of the uterus or stump of the cervix is lifted back up to its natural position by attaching a synthetic mesh from the top and back of the vagina to the sacral promontory. The mesh provides the vagina with the right amount of support to keep it in the correct position (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of the surgical mesh repair \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo particular criterion standard for POP repair exists, yet the open abdominal mesh sacrocolpopexy has been revered as the main abdominal approach\n [7, 8] for correction given its cure rates of 85-100% in recent studies.\n [9, 10] However, when performed via a robotic-assisted laparoscopic (RAL) approach, the procedure is comparable in its clinical results, providing the same long-term durability of open sacrocolpopexy with the added benefits of a minimally invasive surgery, greater precision and control during the procedure, less pain, less blood loss, better cosmesis, and shorter hospitalization.\n [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] Many surgeons are unfortunately limited in their knowledge of how to skillfully perform sacrocolpopexies laparoscopically, but the assistance from a robotic system can significantly reduce the learning curve associated with laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

The etiology of superficial scrotal abscess is infected hair follicles and infections of scrotal lacerations or minor scrotal surgeries. An intrascrotal abscess most commonly arises from bacterial epididymitis, but may also be related to tuberculous infection of the epididymis, a testicular abscess that ruptures through the tunica albuginea, or drainage of appendicitis into scrotum through a patent processus vaginalis.\n [1] Scrotal abscesses can also occur as a result of extravasation of infected urine from the urethra in patients with a urethral stricture and neurogenic bladder using an external collection device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrotal abscess. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nFournier gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis) is a gangrenous process that involves the external genitalia.

The diagnosis of a scrotal abscess is often made by history and physical examination. The scrotum is often erythematous and edematous. Scrotal fluctuance may be palpable. Tenderness of the affected epididymis and/or testis may be present. If epididymitis is the source of the abscess, the scrotal wall may be fixed to the underlying epididymis. Scrotal ultrasound is helpful in diagnosing an intrascrotal abscess when an inflammatory mass is present. Scrotal ultrasound can localize the involvement of the abscess to the scrotal wall, epididymis, and/or testis.\n [2] \n\nIndications\nThe management of an intrascrotal abscess, regardless of the cause, requires surgical drainage (see image below). The abscess cavities must be opened and drained, including the testis if it is involved. The cavity should be left open and packed.

        "Simple Prostatectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nSimple (open) prostatectomy differs from radical prostatectomy in that the former consists of enucleation of a hyperplastic prostatic adenoma, and the latter involves removal en bloc of the entire prostate, the seminal vesicles, and the vas deferens. This article reviews the indications for open prostatectomy, discusses the various approaches for this procedure, weighs the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and provides a brief outline of standard surgical technique.\nWhen medical and minimally invasive options for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) have been unsuccessful, the more invasive treatment options for BPH should be considered, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or open prostatectomy. Patients who present for open (simple) prostatectomy are typically age 60 years or older.\n\n\nThe advantages of open (simple) prostatectomy over TURP include the complete removal of the prostatic adenoma under direct visualization in the suprapubic and retropubic approaches. However, these procedures do not obviate the need for further prostate cancer surveillance because the posterior zone of the prostate remains as a potential source of carcinoma formation.\nOpen (simple) prostatectomy has 3 different approaches: retropubic, suprapubic, and perineal. Simple retropubic prostatectomy is the enucleation of a hyperplastic prostatic adenoma through a direct incision of the anterior prostatic capsule. Simple suprapubic prostatectomy is the enucleation of the hyperplastic prostatic adenoma through an extraperitoneal incision of the lower anterior bladder wall.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nIndications for Open (Simple) Prostatectomy\nThe indications for either TURP or open (simple) prostatectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAcute urinary retention\n\n\n\n\nPersistent or recurrent urinary tract infections\n\n\n\n\nSignificant hemorrhage or recurrent hematuria\n\n\n\n\nBladder calculi secondary to bladder outlet obstruction\n\n\n\n\nSignificant symptoms from bladder outlet obstruction that are not responsive to medical or minimally invasive therapy\n\n\n\n\nRenal insufficiency secondary to chronic bladder outlet obstruction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of retropubic prostatectomy\nAdvantages of the retropubic technique over the suprapubic approach include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperb anatomic prostatic exposure\n\n\n\n\nDirect visualization of the adenoma during enucleation to ensure complete removal\n\n\n\n\nPrecise division of the prostatic urethra, optimizing preservation of urinary continence\n\n\n\n\nDirect visualization of the prostatic fossa after enucleation for hemorrhage control\n\n\n\n\nMinimal to no surgical trauma to the bladder\n\n\n\nAdvantages of suprapubic prostatectomy\nThe major advantage of the suprapubic approach over the retropubic approach is that it permits better visualization of the bladder neck and ureteral orifices and is therefore better suited for patients with the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarged, protuberant, median prostatic lobe\n\n\n\n\nConcomitant symptomatic bladder diverticulum\n\n\n\n\nLarge bladder calculus\n\n\n\n\nObesity (to a degree that makes access to the retropubic space more difficult)\n\n\n\nAdvantages of simple perineal prostatectomy\nAdvantages of perineal prostatectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility to treat clinically significant prostatic abscess and prostatic cysts\n\n\n\n\nLess postoperative pain\n\n\n\n\nAbility to avoid the retropubic space\n\n\n\nWith regard to the last point, above, retropubic or suprapubic surgery is more difficult in patients who have had prior retropubic surgery.\n\nContraindications to Open (Simple) Prostatectomy\nOpen (simple) prostatectomy is contraindicated in the presence of prostate cancer. If cancer is suspected, a formal prostate biopsy should be performed before surgery is considered.\n\nIf cystoscopy findings indicate that the obstructing adenoma primarily involves the median lobe, the suprapubic approach may be preferred to the retropubic technique, because the suprapubic procedure optimizes anatomic exposure.\n\nIn addition, retropubic prostatectomy offers only limited access to the bladder, which is an important consideration if a bladder diverticulum requiring excision coexists or if a large bladder calculus must be directly removed.\n\nThe perineal approach can be contraindicated in patients in whom sexual potency remains important. In this procedure, the perineal neurovascular anatomy is invaded more extensively than it is in the other available open techniques.\n\nDisadvantages of open (simple) prostatectomy\nOpen (simple) prostatectomy does have disadvantages when compared with TURP. These include the morbidity and longer hospitalization associated with the open procedure and the potential for greater intraoperative hemorrhage.\n\nA disadvantage to the use of suprapubic approach relates to reduced visualization of the apical prostatic adenoma and the potential complications of postoperative urinary incontinence and intraoperative bleeding.\n\nOther Considerations\nOther considerations include congestive heart failure, prostate size, and bladder pathology.\n\nThe transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome of dilution hyponatremia is unique to TURP and does not occur with open (simple) prostatectomy. The incidence of TUR syndrome during a TURP is roughly 2%. Thus, in patients with a greater risk of congestive heart failure caused by underlying cardiopulmonary disease, open prostatectomy has a much smaller risk of intraoperative fluid challenge.\n\nConsider open (simple) prostatectomy, using either the retropubic or suprapubic approach, when the prostate is larger than 75 g or larger than the surgeon can resect reliably with TURP in 60-90 minutes.\n\nIn patients with concomitant bladder pathology that complicates their outlet obstruction (eg, a large or hard bladder calculus, symptomatic bladder diverticulum), open prostatectomy remains the procedure of choice. Additionally, patients with musculoskeletal disease that precludes proper patient positioning in the dorsal lithotomy position for TURP may benefit from an open prostatectomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Sperm Retrieval for IVF-ICSI": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA variety of techniques exist for sperm retrieval for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), including percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration, microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration, testicular sperm aspiration, and open testicular sperm extraction. Each procedure is associated with its own risks and benefits, but all provide similar outcomes with appropriate patient selection.\n\n\nWith more refined diagnostic techniques and the development of IVF, surgical sperm retrieval is now often employed as a method to provide needed sperm for IVF (fertilization of the female egg with sperm through incubation in a controlled environment outside of the body) or IVF-ICSI (the direct injection of sperm into the female egg). This technique is used when few sperm are available or sperm of low quality are used, such as in azoospermia.\n [1, 2] \nPrior to IVF and IVF-ICSI, when only intrauterine insemination techniques were available, the harvest of intrinsically nonmotile sperm from the testicle resulted in take-home baby rates close to zero. With the advent of IVF and IVF-ICSI, it is now commonplace to achieve take-home baby rates in excess of 50%, even with nonmotile sperm obtained from testis biopsy.\n\n\n\n\nThe background anatomy in the images below may be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMale infertility. Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis stimulatory and inhibitory signals. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary. FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells to facilitate sperm production, while LH stimulates testosterone release from the Leydig cells. Feedback inhibition is from testosterone and inhibin. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMale infertility. Testicular histology magnified 500 times. Leydig cells reside in the interstitium.

In these men, spermatogenesis is attenuated, leading to testicular hypofunction. However, it will often improve with medical treatment only, negating the need for surgical sperm retrieval.\n\nOutcomes\nMen undergoing vasectomy reversal after failed percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration with IVF (inadequate sperm found or IVF failure) have been shown to have equivalent future success rates of vasectomy reversal compared to men not having undergone percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration despite the theoretical risk of epididymal scarring from the procedure.\n [4] \n\nProponents of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction report increased spermatozoa detection due to the ability to identify more robust and healthy seminiferous tubules for removal. Multiple comparison studies have corroborated this, with the microdissection technique yielding roughly 20% more spermatozoa found.\n [5, 6, 7] \n\nThe number of biopsies performed searching for sperm is variable, but studies have shown that if sperm are present they are often found within the first four biopsies.\n [8, 9, 10, 11] Although on average the first four biopsies will predict successful sperm retrieval, most surgeons will still perform more than this. Risks from the surgery such as hematoma, scarring, or testicular atrophy are similar with or without the use of the microscope. However, it is felt that with the use of the microscope there is less risk of vascular damage to the tunica albuginea since vessels are more readily identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Suprapubic Aspiration": "\nOverview\n\n\nSuprapubic aspiration and catheterization is a procedure to obtain uncontaminated urine from the urinary bladder.\n [1] It is easy to perform in the emergency department and is associated with minimal complications. Huze and Beeson first published this practice in 1956 as an alternative to more traditional methods of obtaining urine for analysis and culture.\n [2] Their findings suggested that suprapubic catheterization and aspiration was superior to clean-catch or transurethral (via catheterization) collection of bladder urine for bacteriologic study.\nThe sensitivity of the aspirated urine for bacteriuria on urinalysis approaches 100% and is rarely associated with contamination.\n [3] In a study comparing contamination rates of various urine collection methods for children less than 24 months old, suprapubic catheterization had a contamination rate of 1% compared to 26% for clean-catch and 12% for catheterized specimens.\n [4]  A study by Breinbjerg et al found that for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in young children, urinary dipstick testing of a sample obtained by suprapubic aspiration had a sensitivity of 78.9% and a specificity of 82.2%, whereas testing of a sample obtained by the midstream clean-catch method had a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 14.4%.\n [5] \n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe adult bladder is located in the anterior pelvis and is enveloped by extraperitoneal fat and connective tissue.

Conversely, the bladder of a child is an abdominal organ and contacts the lower two thirds of the abdominal wall between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus.

        "Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy of the Prostate (TUMT)": "\nOverview\n\n\nTransurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) is one of various procedures used for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) in men. TUMT involves the insertion of a specially designed urinary catheter into the bladder, allowing a microwave antenna to be positioned within the prostate; there, it heats and destroys hyperplastic prostate tissue. An example of a TUMT device is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Targis machine is a small, portable transurethral microwave thermotherapy device. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of TUMT is to provide a 1-time efficacious treatment of LUTS due to BPH as an alternative to pharmacotherapy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP), open prostatic enucleation, or other surgical therapies.\nHistory and development\nMcCaskey used heat in the form of ultraviolet lamps to treat prostatism in 1921. In 1929, Corbus used diathermy probes for the same purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYerushalmi and associates reintroduced microwave therapy for prostatic enlargement in 1985 using a transrectal probe to treat patients with BPH who were otherwise poor operative candidates.\n [1] \n\nThe first TUMT clinical trials used a transurethral catheter in a series of ten 1-hour sessions, although the software and instrumentation allowed only a limited and often interrupted delivery of energy to the prostate. Intraprostatic temperatures reached 40-45°C; symptomatic improvement was suggested to be due to destruction of the alpha-adrenergic nerve fibers around the prostate, since an objective improvement of voiding parameters was not observed and histologic studies revealed that prostatic cells were not destroyed.\n\nIt has since been shown that prostate cells are not reliably destroyed until temperatures reach 45°C (113°F). The term thermotherapy was therefore coined to describe treatment temperatures above 45°C and hyperthermia for those below this level. However, the urethral-pain threshold was shown to be 45°C; therefore, higher energy and higher temperatures were achieved only with the introduction of urethral cooling during therapy.\n\nImprovement in antennae design allowed better distribution of the energy to the transition zone of the prostate, the main source of adenomatous tissue. With thermotherapy, objective and subjective parameters reflected significant improvement. Histologic examination of specimens revealed cell destruction but no reliable cavitation. Patients invariably had severe prostatic edema and urinary retention, requiring the use of a urinary catheter.\n\nHigh-energy thermotherapy has since been introduced; it can achieve temperatures greater than 70°C (158°F), causing thermoablation of prostatic tissue. Unlike thermotherapy, high-energy thermoablation causes prostatic cavities, resulting in greater improvement in symptoms and objective parameters. However, unlike with TURP, patients apparently do not notice an immediate improvement but instead experience a gradual change over a period of months.\n\nIn patients presenting with urinary retention, TUMT was originally considered to be insufficient therapy. Many of these patients, however, were older, had a larger prostate volume, and had more surgical comorbidities, making this subset more likely to benefit from a minimally invasive option. With the advent of high-energy TUMT, patients are now offered this less-invasive therapy, with a catheter-free rate of 82-91% in selected patients, although most also must continue medical therapy.\n\nTUMT and non-BPH pathology\nMicrowave therapy may be of value to treat other types of prostate pathology, such as chronic prostatitis, with one study reporting a 25% complete and sustained improvement and a 50% rate of mild improvement in 45 patients. This article, however, will concentrate on the use of TUMT in the treatment of BPH.\n\nFor patient education information, see eMedicineHealth's Men's Health Center, as well as Enlarged Prostate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Transurethral Needle Ablation of the Prostate (TUNA)": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction to the TUNA Procedure\nTransurethral needle ablation (TUNA) of the prostate is a procedure used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is performed by placing interstitial radiofrequency (RF) needles through the urethra and into the lateral lobes of the prostate, causing heat-induced coagulation necrosis. The tissue is heated to 110°C at an RF power of 456 kHz for approximately 3 minutes per lesion. A coagulation defect is created.\n\n\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was originally developed in the United States between 1920 and 1930 and was generally considered the criterion standard for surgical management of BPH.\nAdvances in the surgical treatment of BPH have come via applications of traditional electrosurgical current. TUNA is one of these minimally invasive treatments of prostatism. It began as a treatment in the early 1990s, with the first preliminary trials on humans in 1993. The first studies in the United States began in 1994, and the US Food and Drug Administration approved TUNA of the prostate in 1996.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a decline in the use of this procedure has occurred as newer techniques to treat BPH (laser ablation/enucleation, thermotherapy) have arisen and become more popular.\n [1]  Contributing to its decline, TUNA has also been noted to have a high retreatment rate at 20 months follow-up.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nThe TUNA system produces thermal tissue ablation by applying low-level RF energy to prostate tissue. The generated RF is in the form of electrical energy and is delivered by the 2 electrodes, which are in contact with the patient. As the prostate cells resist passage of the current, thermal energy is produced by friction and by the heating of water molecules. This leads to tissue heating and, ultimately, coagulation necrosis. Thermal lesions occur only in a localized area, because the RF signal is transmitted into tissue only by direct contact.\n\nAlthough the ideal use of TUNA has been thought to be in patients with large lateral lobes, Naslund and Stitcher reported that TUNA can be used effectively in patients with large median lobes. The key to this form of treatment is to ensure that the needles are in the median lobe and do not protrude into the bladder.\n\nIndications for the Performance of TUNA\nMinimally invasive therapy is an option after failed medical management for benign hyperplasia of the prostate. This therapy is also the primary treatment for patients who are not interested in medical therapy and are unwilling to undergo TURP.\n\nGenerally, the ideal patient for TUNA is thought to be a man with obstructive symptoms and a prostate of 60 g or less with predominantly lateral lobes. Patients found to have larger glands may be offered different forms of treatment.\n\nA small study (N=121) by Law et al showed that TUNA is most appropriate for patients with symptomatic BPH who are unable to tolerate the side effects of medication or are unwilling to commit to long-term medical therapy, are at high risk for complications of general anesthesia, or have a small prostate volume of 20-30 mL.\n [3] \n\nContraindications to the Performance of TUNA\nThe manufacturer lists the following contraindications to TUNA therapy:\n\n\n\n\n\nActive urinary tract infection\n\n\n\n\nNeurogenic, decompensated, or atonic bladder\n\n\n\n\nUrethral strictures or muscle spasms that prevent insertion of the cartridge sheath\n\n\n\n\nBleeding disorders or patients taking anticoagulation medication unless antiplatelet medication has been discontinued for at least 10 days\n\n\n\n\nASA class group V patients\n\n\n\n\nClinical or histological evidence of prostatic cancer or bladder cancer\n\n\n\n\nProstate gland that is less than 34 mm or greater than 80 mm in transverse diameter\n\n\n\n\nPresence of any prosthetic device in a region that may interfere with the procedure\n\n\n\n\nPatients whose prostate has previously been treated with nonpharmacologic therapies\n\n\n\n\nPresence of cardiac pacemaker, implantable defibrillator, or malleable penile implants\n\n\n\n\nPatients with any component(s) of an implantable neurostimulation system\n\n\n\nVery limited experience has been gained regarding the use of TUNA to treat patients with high bladder necks. At this time, these patients should probably be treated with another form of therapy.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nA normal prostate gland is approximately 20 g in volume, 3 cm in length, 4 cm wide, and 2 cm in depth. As men get older, the prostate gland is variable in size secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The gland is located posterior to the pubic symphysis, superior to the perineal membrane, inferior to the bladder, and anterior to the rectum. The base of the prostate is in continuity with the bladder and the prostate ends at the apex before becoming the striated external urethral sphincter. The sphincter is a vertically oriented tubular sheath that surrounds the membranous urethra and prostate. See the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-panel drawing shows normal male reproductive and urinary anatomy and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

        "Transurethral Resection of the Prostate": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nFor most of the 20th century, from 1909 until the late 1990s, the premier treatment for symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) was transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). TURP was the first successful, minimally invasive surgical procedure of the modern era. To this day, it remains the criterion standard therapy for obstructive prostatic hypertrophy and is both the surgical treatment of choice and the standard of care when other methods fail.\n\n\nSince the advent of medical therapy for symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and alpha-adrenergic blockers, the need for immediate surgical intervention in symptomatic prostatic obstruction has been reduced substantially. However, alpha-blockers do not modify prostate growth, and even the use of prostatic growth inhibitors such as finasteride or dutasteride often fails to prevent recurrent urinary symptoms of BPH and retention. In the past, these patients would almost certainly have undergone TURP years earlier.\nThe criteria for performing TURP surgery are now more stringent than before. In general, TURP surgery is reserved for patients with symptomatic BPH who have acute, recurrent, or chronic urinary retention; in whom medical management and less-invasive prostatic surgical procedures failed; who have prostates of an unusual size or shape (eg, a markedly enlarged median lobe, significant intravesical prostatic encroachment); who have azotemia or renal insufficiency due to prostatic obstruction; or who have the most severe symptoms of prostatism.\n\n\n\n\nLess common uses of TURP include intractable prostatitis or for tissue sampling when standard biopsy techniques cannot be used.\n\n\n\n\nThe relative frequency of TURP compared to open prostatectomy in surgical patients varies from country to country. In 1990, the relative frequency rate of TURPs in surgical patients with BPH in the United States was 97%, with similar rates in Denmark and Sweden. The lowest rates of TURP were noted in Japan (70%) and France (69%).\n\nThe average age of patients currently undergoing TURP is approximately 69 years, and the average amount of prostate tissue resected is 22 g. Risk factors associated with increased morbidity include prostate glands larger than 45 g, operative time longer than 90 minutes, and acute urinary retention as the presenting symptom. The 5-year risk rate for a reoperation following TURP is approximately 5%. Overall mortality rates following TURP by a skilled surgeon are virtually 0%.\n\nAfrican Americans more typically present for TURP surgery with urinary retention or urinary infections and have a higher incidence of preexisting medical problems compared to the general population. According to Kang et al (2004), reports from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial indicate that Asian and Asian American men have the lowest overall risk of clinical BPH and eventual TURP.\n [1] \n\nGo to Prostate Cancer, Prostate-Specific Antigen, and Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy for complete information on these topics.\n\nIndications\nAccording to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of BPH and the recommendations of the Second International Consultation on Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, the absolute indications for primary surgical management of BPH are as follows:\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\nRefractory urinary retention\n\n\n\n\nRecurrent urinary tract infections due to prostatic hypertrophy\n\n\n\n\nRecurrent gross hematuria\n\n\n\n\nRenal insufficiency secondary to bladder outlet obstruction\n\n\n\n\nBladder calculi\n\n\n\n\nPermanently damaged or weakened bladders\n\n\n\n\nLarge bladder diverticula that do not empty well secondary to an enlarged prostate\n\n\n\nMost men who present for surgical correction of their urinary outlet obstruction are those in whom medical therapy or alternative procedures have failed or are inappropriate for some reason. In general, patients with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms (American Urological Association [AUA] symptom index >8) who have not responded to alpha-adrenergic blockers and/or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are also candidates for surgical intervention.\n\nA study by Blanchard et al showed that patients in whom alpha-blocker therapy is ineffective or those in whom it has failed tend to have poorer outcomes after TURP than men who proceed directly to a transurethral resection.\n [3] This is presumably from preoperative bladder damage and other risk factors that affect voiding rather than the size of the prostate. Operating time and weight of resected tissue have been documented as the same between the 2 groups; therefore, prostatic size alone does not account for the difference in outcomes.\n\nAlthough persistent, progressive, or bothersome symptoms of urinary obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy that are refractory to medical therapy constitute the most common indication for TURP, 70% of men undergoing the procedure have multiple indications. Patients with prostates larger than 45 g, who present with acute urinary retention, or who require operating times in excess of 90 minutes, are at increased risk for postoperative complications.\n\nSurgical treatment of BPH is also indicated in cases of renal failure or insufficiency secondary to prostatic obstruction. Catheter drainage is usually recommended in such cases until the renal failure resolves. As many as 10% of men with BPH present with some degree of renal insufficiency.\n\nContraindications\nThe only absolute indication for an open prostatectomy over a TURP is the need for an additional open procedure on the bladder that must be performed at the same time as the prostatectomy. Such indications include open surgical resection of a large bladder diverticulum or removal of a bladder stone that cannot be easily fragmented by intracorporeal lithotripsy.\n\nA relative indication for the selection of an open prostate surgery over a TURP is generally based on prostatic volume and the ability of the surgeon to complete the TURP in less than 90 minutes of actual operating time (although < 60 min is considered optimal).\n\nIn general, open prostatectomy can be justified in a patient with a prostate of 45 g or larger, but this is totally dependent on the skill and experience of the endoscopic urological surgeon. Most experienced urologists use a prostatic volume of 60-100 g as the upper limit amenable to endoscopic removal, but some highly skilled resectionists are capable of safely treating a 200-g prostate with TURP in less than 90 minutes.\n\nDeclining Frequency of TURP\nThe new availability of reasonable alternative medical and surgical treatment options means that TURP, once one of the most commonly practiced urological procedures, is now performed much less frequently. In 1962, TURP operations accounted for more than 50% of all major surgical procedures performed by urologists in the United States. By 1986, this had declined to 38%.\n\nThe 1985 Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study estimated the lifetime probability of surgical intervention for prostatic enlargement at 29%, and the 1986 National Health Survey estimated that 350,000 patients in the Medicare age group had a TURP that year, compared to fewer than 200,000 in that same age group by 1998.\n\nThese numbers should be considered within the context that the median age of the typical patient is rising (the number of older men with BPH-related symptoms in the United States is expected to increase from 5 million to 9 million persons by 2025), the size of the average resected prostate gland is increasing, and the typical patient has more comorbidities and is generally less healthy than surgical patients of the past.\n\nA comprehensive review of transurethral prostatectomy in the Medicare beneficiaries by Wasson et al compared a national sample from 1991-1997 to a similar group for the period 1984-1990 found that the more recent group demonstrated a substantial decline in the number of TURP surgeries: 50% for white men and 40% for black men.\n [4] Compared to the peak period of TURP use in the 1980s, a higher proportion of the men undergoing the procedure were older in the more recent period, with 53% aged 75 years or older.\n\nAnother factor that must be considered when evaluating the general decline in the number of TURP procedures performed is the significant reduction in financial reimbursement to urologists for TURP surgeries in the United States.\n\nPhysician reimbursement from Medicare for a TURP has dropped from a high of $2000-$3000 in the past to approximately $650 today, with a 90-day global period that covers all postoperative care by the surgeon for 3 months. In many instances, performing a TURP is simply not profitable for the urologist when office overhead, billing and malpractice costs are considered, especially when complications occur.\n\nAlternative surgical procedures, such as microwave therapy and prostatic laser surgery, are reimbursed at much higher levels, even though they may not be as durable or effective. This creates a strong financial disincentive for urologists to perform TURP procedures, except when no reasonable alternatives exist. A 2002 article by Donnell examined the history of Medicare policies and the effect of changes in Medicare reimbursement on TURP.\n [5] \n\nIn a large Canadian series reported by Borth et al, the number of TURP procedures dropped by 60% between 1988 and 1998, presumably because of medical therapy, despite an increase of 16% in the male population older than 50 years.\n [6] While the number of patients presenting with urinary retention was significantly higher in the 1998 group than in the 1988 cohort (55% vs 23%), no significant difference was noted in their average age, medical comorbidities, operative parameters, average size of prostate tissue resected, or complication rates.\n\nAnatomic Considerations\nThe prostate is divided into 3 zones: peripheral, central, and transition. The peripheral zone is the largest of the zones, encompassing approximately 75% of the total prostate glandular tissue in men without BPH. Most prostate cancers originate in the peripheral zone. It is located posteriorly and extends laterally on either side of the urethra.\n\nThe central zone is smaller and extends primarily around the ejaculatory ducts. It differs from the peripheral zone primarily in cytologic details and architecture.\n\nThe transition zone is usually the smallest of the 3: it occupies only 5% of the prostate volume in men younger than 30 years. This is the zone thought to be the origin of BPH. The transition zone consists of two separate lobes on either side of the urethra and usually involves a small grouping of ductal tissue near the central portion of the prostatic urethra near the internal sphincter.\n\nAs the transition zone expands, it can comprise up to 95% of the prostate volume, compressing the other zones. Intraoperatively, the 2 enlarged lobes of the transition zone can be seen obstructing the prostatic urethra on either side. Thus, the term lateral lobes is often used intraoperatively for this tissue to distinguish it from any hyperplastic periurethral gland tissue.\n\nThe periurethral glands are less commonly involved with BPH, but when they do become enlarged, they can form what is termed a median lobe, which appears as a teardrop-shaped midline structure at the posterior bladder neck. This can ball-valve into the urethra, creating severe obstructive voiding symptoms. Any significant intravesical extension of prostatic tissue can act as a valve when the detrusor pressure increases and presses this tissue against the bladder neck or across the outlet to the urethra, creating a functional obstruction (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy of the lateral and median lobes. Various configurations. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn some earlier jargon, the transition zone and periurethral region were called the central gland or inner gland, and the peripheral and central zones were called the outer gland. This terminology should be avoided both because it is vague and because it creates confusion with the now-standard anatomical label of the central zone.\n\nProstatic calculi are formed from calcification of the corpora amylacea and precipitation of prostatic secretions. They occur between the transition zone and the compressed peripheral zone; in fact, they can be used as a marker for this border. Prostatic calculi are generally composed of calcium phosphate and are not considered clinically significant. Chemical analysis is unnecessary.\n\nAlthough prostatic calculi may arise spontaneously, they also may be formed in response to an inflammatory reaction or as a consequence of another pathological process that produces acinar obstruction. Some practitioners believe that calcifications that form in response to bacterial prostatitis may harbor bacteria that periodically flourish, causing recurrent prostatitis. Proponents of this theory advocate TURP to liberalize these calcifications as a treatment for recurrent prostatitis.\n\nIf a channel is opened during surgery that allows these calculi to be expressed, they often flow out by themselves if the opening is large enough. They can be milked out by using the end of the cutting loop without current to gently press around the opening where the prostatic stones are seen and can be pushed into the opened prostatic fossa. They can be rinsed into the bladder and evacuated with the rest of the resected prostatic chips.\n\nThe prostate is thinnest and most narrow anteriorly (the 12-o’clock position when viewed through a cystoscope). Care should be taken when operating in this area to avoid perforating the prostatic capsule, especially if this portion of the prostate is resected early in the operation. Abundant venous blood vessels are located in the area just anterior to the prostatic capsule, which can cause significant bleeding that cannot be easily controlled if the vessels are damaged during resection.\n\nThe external sphincter muscle tends to be slightly tilted, with the most proximal portion located anteriorly, opposite the verumontanum. The external sphincter can be identified cystoscopically by its wrinkling and constricting action as the resectoscope is withdrawn. Upon reinsertion, the superficial mucosa in front of the telescope tends to bunch up. This is because the external sphincter muscle is imbedded within the urogenital diaphragm, which is relatively fixed in position, while the prostate has some limited mobility.\n\nThe verumontanum is the single most important anatomical landmark in TURP (see the image below). It is a midline structure located on the floor of the distal prostatic urethra just proximal to the external sphincter muscle. It appears as a small, rounded hump that is best seen when withdrawing the telescope through the prostate while visualizing the prostatic floor at the 6-o’clock position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic anatomy of the prostate, sagittal section. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe orifices to the ejaculatory ducts emerge in the verumontanum (see the first image below). Its importance lies in its position immediately proximal to the external sphincter muscle (see the second image below), which allows it to be used as the distal landmark for prostate resection. The precise distance between the verumontanum and the external sphincter demonstrates some slight individual variation and should be verified visually before starting the resection and periodically during the surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the prostate and bladder, posterior view. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the prostate and urethra. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe proximity of the ureteral orifices to the cephalad margin of the hypertrophied prostate varies, particularly in patients with an enlarged median lobe. This distance should be frequently assessed throughout surgery.\n\nThe vascular anatomy of the prostate was accurately described in detail by Rubin Flocks in 1937.\n [7] The blood supply of the prostate comes primarily from branches of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood supply to the prostate. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nWhen the inferior vesical artery reaches the prostate just at the vesicoprostatic border, it branches into 2 groups of arteries (see the image below). One penetrating group passes directly into the prostate toward the interior of the bladder neck. Upon reaching the prostatic interior near the urethra, most of these branches turn distally and parallel the prostatic urethra, while others supply the median lobe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood supply to the prostate. Note the two main branches: urethral and capsular. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nVessels that parallel the prostatic urethra supply most of the blood to the hypertrophied lateral lobes. The second large group of arteries follows the exterior of the prostatic capsule posterolaterally, periodically giving rise to perforating vessels, and supplies the area around the verumontanum.\n\nSee Prostate Anatomy and Male Urethra Anatomy for more information.\n\nDevelopment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia\nMechanisms of disease\n\nThe prostate has been described as the organ of the body most likely to be involved with disease of some sort in men older than 60 years. This statement characterizes any histological evidence of BPH as a disease, which is certainly debatable, but there is no argument that BPH is an extremely common clinical entity.\n\nAs the hyperplastic process increases the volume of the prostate, the urethral lumen is compressed, causing outlet obstruction. An enlarged median lobe may cause relatively more severe symptoms than lateral lobe hyperplasia of similar magnitude because it can act as a valve at which increased bladder pressure may actually cause further obstruction. Intravesical extension of the lateral lobes may act in a similar fashion.\n\nIt has been known for many years, however, that prostate size alone is not a reliable or accurate predictor of the presence or degree of urinary outlet obstruction. The failure of several purely obstructive therapies, such as prostatic balloon dilatation, and the obvious success of alpha-adrenergic blockers eventually led to the description of BPH as having both a dynamic (neurogenic) and a mechanical (obstructive) component.\n\nThus, at the same time as the occurrence of mechanical obstruction, a dynamic component involving the stromal prostatic tissue and bladder is present, which is often more significant in causing urinary symptoms than simple mechanical obstruction from an enlarged prostate. The precise interaction of these two mechanisms, mechanical and dynamic, is not well understood.\n\nWhen a bladder is trying to empty through a blocked outlet from an obstructing prostate gland, the intravesical pressure required to open the bladder neck is increased. The bladder is initially able to produce a higher transitory voiding pressure when required, but loses muscle tone over time.\n\nIsolated muscle bundles hypertrophy in response to the need for a higher intravesical pressure to overcome the increased resistance to voiding, and bladder trabeculation often follows. The spaces between these hypertrophied bundles tend to become thinner, with less functional muscle. Eventually, this can progress to the point at which the bladder becomes almost nonfunctional.\n\nBladder trabeculation is usually graded on a scale of I-IV. When seen on cystoscopy images, it is a relative indicator of the degree and duration of any bladder outlet obstruction (eg, BPH), although any detrusor hyperactivity problem can possibly produce bladder trabeculations, even without an identifiable obstruction. Initial symptomatic changes include increased bladder instability and irritability, which can eventually progress to muscular decompensation with permanent loss of detrusor contractile ability.\n\nEvidence indicates that obstruction causes partial denervation of bladder smooth muscle, which results in further bladder irritability and involuntary detrusor contractions. Fortunately, most of these hyperactive symptoms resolve over time with removal of the prostatic obstruction or with a response to appropriate medications. The detrusor becomes less able to maintain a constant voiding pressure over time, which leads to early termination of voiding, intermittency of the urinary stream, and higher residual urine volume, accompanied by loss of bladder compliance.\n\nOverall bladder mass increases because of detrusor muscle hypertrophy, but collagen deposition is also increased, which eventually contributes to decompensation, urinary retention, and permanent loss of detrusor contractile ability.\n\nProposed causes\n\nBPH is thought to be caused by aging and by long-term testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production, although their precise roles are not completely clear.\n\nHistopathologic evidence of BPH is present in approximately 8% of men in their fourth decade and in 90% of men by their ninth decade. Loss of testosterone early in life prevents the development of BPH. The similarities in presentation, pathological examination findings, and symptoms of BPH among identical twins suggest a hereditary influence.\n\nOnce BPH has developed, it tends to progress. Cross-sectional studies based on cadaver autopsies or consecutive patients seen in urology clinics suggest that the growth rate decreases with age. In patients aged 31-50 years, the prostate doubling time averages 4.5 years. In men aged 51-70 years, the prostatic doubling time is approximately 10 years, while in men older than 70 years, the doubling time increases to more than 100 years. Note that these findings may only reflect a selection bias in the sample group.\n\nA 5-year longitudinal study by Rhodes and colleagues of 631 community men aged 40-79 years from Olmsted County, Minnesota demonstrated an average annual prostate growth rate of 1.6%. This remained essentially constant regardless of age, although men with larger prostates tended to have higher growth rates.\n\nThe average prostate weighs approximately 20 g by the third decade and remains relatively constant in size and weight unless BPH develops. The typical patient with BPH has a prostate that averages 33 g. Only 4% of the male population ever develops prostates of 100 g or larger. (The largest recorded prostatectomy specimen weighed 820 g. This prostate was removed by open suprapubic prostatectomy. Unfortunately, the patient ultimately died of hemorrhage.)\n\nSymptoms of BPH tend to progress slowly over time in most individuals, with an average annual increase of 0.14-0.44 points per year in the AUA symptom index for men aged 60 years and older. Once BPH has begun, the prostate grows an average of 0.6 mL in volume annually, with a mean decrease in average urinary peak flow rate of 0.2 mL per second each year. Men older than 70 years and those with a baseline peak flow rate less than 10 mL/s tend to have a more rapid and dramatic decline in their peak flow rates over time.\n\nDHT has an affinity for prostate cell androgen receptors that is 5 times greater than that of testosterone. The levels of 5-alpha reductase are increased in the stromal tissue of men with BPH compared to controls. This and other data indicate that DHT is much more important in the development of prostatic hypertrophy than testosterone is.\n\nThe success of 5-alpha reductase blockers, such as finasteride and dutasteride, in reducing prostatic size and relieving symptoms seems to confirm this, although it does not explain the relative lack of symptom relief in those with smaller prostate glands treated with these agents.\n\nClinical manifestations and medical treatment\n\nClassic symptoms of BPH include a slow, intermittent, or weak urinary stream; the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying; double voiding (the need to void within a few seconds or minutes of urinating); postvoid dribbling; urinary frequency; and nocturia. Patients may also present with acute or chronic urinary retention, urinary tract infections, gross hematuria, renal insufficiency, bladder pain, a palpable abdominal mass, or overflow incontinence.\n\nUpon physical examination, the bladder may be palpable during the abdominal examination and the prostate may be enlarged during the digital rectal examination. Symptoms are not necessarily proportional to the size of the prostate on digital rectal examination or transrectal ultrasound findings.\n\nAlpha-adrenergic receptors are present and functional in the stromal smooth muscle of the prostate and especially at the bladder neck. Many studies have documented the success of various alpha-adrenergic blockers in relieving symptoms of BPH. Evidence from the Medical Therapy of Prostate Symptoms Trial indicates that combination therapy with both an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor can delay the progression of symptoms and is more effective over time than either medication alone for reducing symptom scores and improving peak urinary flow rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Ureteroneocystostomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nUreteroneocystostomy (UNC) refers to reimplantation of the ureter into the bladder. In the adult population, ureteroneocystostomy is primarily used for disease or trauma involving the lower third portion of the ureter that results in obstruction or fistula. In children, ureteroneocystostomy it is commonly used for surgical treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).\n [1, 2] \nKey considerations\nGenerally, treatment for ureteral injury, stricture, and obstruction depends on the length of the defect, location, etiology, and time of diagnosis.\n [3] Ureteroneocystostomy is the procedure of choice to correct distal ureteral injuries in close proximity to the bladder that measure 3-5 cm. These injuries differ from more proximal injuries in that they are frequently associated with disruption of the blood supply from the iliac vessels and are thus best repaired with a ureteroneocystostomy.\n [4] Modifications, such as a psoas hitch (tacking the posterior bladder wall to the psoas muscle) and a Boari flap (tubularization of a flap of bladder to extend from the bladder to the ureteral orifice), allow for correction of ureteral defects that are longer than 5 cm.\n [1] \n\n\nPrinciples for obtaining successful ureteroneocystostomy outcomes include lack of tension, debridement and spatulation of the ureter, and postoperative drainage.\n [5] Open and minimally invasive laparoscopic approaches to ureteroneocystostomy have been described.\n [6, 1] \n\n\n\n\nIndications\nInjury, stricture, or obstruction of the distal 3-4 cm of the ureter is an indication for ureteroneocystostomy. More extensive loss of the ureter can be bridged with a vesico-psoas hitch or Boari bladder flap. Approximately one third of traumatic injuries and most iatrogenic injuries during pelvic procedures occur in the distal ureter.\n [4] Other indications for ureteroneocystostomy include distal ureteral cancers that cannot be removed endoscopically, pelvic malignancies involving the ureter, and renal transplantation and complications arising from transplanted kidneys.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nIndications for psoas hitch\n\nThe psoas hitch is a useful technique for bridging a defect involving the lower third of the ureter. Indications include distal ureteral injury, ureteral fistulae secondary to pelvic surgery, segmental resection of a distal ureteral tumor, and failed ureteroneocystostomy.\n [8] \n\nIndications for Boari flap\n\nBoari flap is a useful adjunct when the diseased segment of ureter is too long or ureteral mobility is too limited to perform a primary ureteroureterostomy. Boari flaps can be created to bridge a 10- to 15-cm defect. If needed, spiral bladder flaps can be constructed to reach the renal pelvis in some circumstances.\n [1] \n\nIndications in the pediatric population\n\nIn the pediatric population, VUR is the most common indication for ureteral reimplantation. However, ureteral reimplantation with or without ureteral tapering is also performed for obstructive megaureters.\n\nContraindications\nSignificant bladder pathology associated with high intravesical pressures and poor compliance (eg, neuropathic bladder) is a contraindication to ureteroneocystostomy. Individuals with dysfunctional voiding are at an increased risk for complications, including persistent VUR and obstruction. Performing ureteroneocystostomy in an irradiated bladder is also a concern. Ureteroneocystostomy is not recommended in patients with a history of bladder cancer.\n\nThe Politano-Leadbetter ureteral reimplantation is contraindicated after puberty or in patients with megaureters.\n [9] \n\nContraindications to psoas hitch and bladder flap\n\nContraindications to psoas hitch include a small contracted bladder with limited mobilization. In addition, ureteral defects proximal to the pelvic brim usually require more than a simple psoas hitch alone.\n\nSmall bladder capacity is likely associated with difficult or inadequate Boari flap creation, warranting considerations of alternative methods. Also, if bladder outlet obstruction, small capacity/high pressure, or neurogenic bladder is possible, urodynamic studies should precede the operation to determine detrusor capacity and compliance. Any existing bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic dysfunction needs to be addressed preoperatively.\n\nSuccess rates\nThe success rate of ureteral reimplantation with a psoas hitch exceeds 85% in both adults and children.\n [10] \n\nIn experienced hands, the success rate of ureteroneocystostomy in patients with low-grade primary VUR approaches 100%.\n [11] \n\nNerve-sparing robotic extravesical ureteral reimplantation is reported to yield a success rate of 97.6% in the pediatric population.\n [12] \n\nLaparoscopic ureteral reimplantation was associated with a success rate of 95.8% in adults undergoing various procedures including psoas hitch, psoas hitch plus Boari flap, and extravesical ureteral reimplantation.\n [13] \n\nAlthough earlier studies of transvesicoscopic ureteral reimplantation demonstrated lower success rates (62%-79%)\n [14, 15] compared with open techniques, later studies have demonstrated more comparable success rates, ranging from 92%-96%.\n [6, 16, 17, 18] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe ureters are paired muscular ducts with narrow lumina that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The ureter is roughly 25-30 cm long in adults and courses down the retroperitoneum in an S curve. At the proximal end of the ureter is the renal pelvis; at the distal end is the bladder. The ureter begins at the level of the renal artery and vein posterior to these structures. This ureteropelvic junction usually coincides with the second lumbar vertebra on the left, with the right being marginally lower.

        "Ureteroureterostomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nUreteroureterostomy (UU) typically refers to an end-to-end anastomosis of the segments of the same ureter, with excision of the intervening injured or scarred ureter. However, in the pediatric population, UU may also be performed in the setting of obstruction of an upper pole ureter associated with a functioning upper pole, whereby the UU is performed in an end-to-side fashion between the upper pole ureter and the lower pole ureter.\nThe basic concept of transperitoneal ureteroureterostomy (TUU) is to bring the injured ureter from one side across the peritoneal cavity under the mesentery of the intestine to the healthy ureter on the opposite side and to anastomose it.\n [1] \n\n\nKey considerations\nGenerally, treatment for ureteral injury, stricture, and obstruction depends on the length of the defect, location, etiology, and time of diagnosis.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nUreteral insults that require UU or TUU result from various conditions, including both blunt and penetrating trauma, iatrogenic injuries, ureteral strictures, and primary and secondary malignancies of pelvic contents.\n\n\n\n\nLess common indications for UU and TUU include a retrocaval ureter or, in pediatrics patients, a functioning but obstructed upper pole moiety of a duplicated collection system (ie, ectopic ureter or ureterocele).\n\nIn the setting of renal trauma (blunt, penetrating, or iatrogenic), the interval from injury to recognition is important and should guide management. If the injury is diagnosed within the first 7 days without a significant concomitant infection, surgical exploration and repair may be performed. The presence of an abscess, urinoma, or fistula should delay an attempt at definitive operative repair. If recognition of the ureteral injury is delayed, an initial endourologic approach or nephrostomy drainage may be the most appropriate initial approach, with subsequent open repair deferred for 1-3 months to allow for resolution of infection and inflammation.\n [3] \n\nThe principles for obtaining successful outcomes for both UU and TUU include prompt diagnosis of the injury in a situation of acute trauma, spatulation of the ureteral end, lack of tension, stenting of the anastomosis, postoperative drainage, and a watertight anastomosis with fine nonreactive absorbable sutures. Although UU is typically performed via an open technique, laparoscopic and robotic approaches have been described.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] \n\nA retrospective study by Villanueva showed that laparoscopic robotic-assisted UU was a safe and effective approach in infants, and the operative time was similar to that of open UU.\n [9]  In another retrospective study, Mattioli et al reported a 100% success rate at short-term follow-up for robotic UU in the treatment of ureterovesical junction pathologies in children.\n [10] \n\nIndications\nRegardless of the etiology, UU is the treatment of choice for a short (2-3 cm) ureteral injury involving the upper third of the ureter. Traumatic ureteral injuries occur in the upper ureter in 39% of cases, mid ureter in 31%, and distal ureter in 30%.\n [11] In a review of 77 retrospective reviews of ureteral injuries after external trauma, Pereira et al (2010) noted that proximal ureteral injury occurred at a rate of 59.7% (±37), while mid and distal injuries occurred in 25.6% (±30.4) and 20.8% (±24.4) of cases, respectively.\n [12] Most traumatic ureteral injuries involve a short-segment loss of ureter; those in the upper and mid ureter can be repaired with mobilization and UU.\n [13] \n\nIn the setting of an obstructed upper pole moiety (ectopic ureter, ureterocele), an upper pole–to–lower pole UU or ureteropyelostomy may be performed. Upper pole–to–lower pole UU may be performed proximally or distally depending on the surgeon’s preference.\n\nTUU is rarely indicated for traumatic ureteral injuries. However, if more extensive ureteral loss is encountered or when pelvic injuries preclude ureteroneocystostomy (ie, rectal injury, major vascular injury, extensive bladder injury), TUU is an excellent option.\n [11] \n\nTUU may also be considered as a treatment option in patients with advanced primary and recurrent pelvic malignancy with unilateral ureteral obstruction, particularly in the setting of prior pelvic irradiation.\n [2, 14] \n\nTUU is occasionally used in the surgical management of pediatric vesicoureteral reflux. In the setting of a small bladder with bilateral ureteral reflux, bilateral ureteral reimplantation may not be feasible. In this setting, a TUU and single ureteral reimplantation may provide a more successful outcome.\n\nContraindications\nOne major contraindication to a TUU is insufficient length of the donor ureter to reach the contralateral ureter in a tension-free manner or a diseased recipient ureter.\n\nRelative contraindications include a history of nephrolithiasis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, urothelial malignancy, chronic pyelonephritis, or abdominopelvic radiation.\n\nIf reflux to the recipient ureter is present, it is recommended that it be corrected, unless it is low grade. A limitation of TUU is the difficulty in intubating the donor ureteral orifice postoperatively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Urethral Catheterization in Men": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nUrethral catheterization is a routine medical procedure that facilitates direct drainage of the urinary bladder.\n [1] It may be used for diagnostic purposes (to help determine the etiology of various genitourinary conditions) or therapeutically (to relieve urinary retention, instill medication, or provide irrigation). Catheters may be inserted as an in-and-out procedure for immediate drainage, left in with a self-retaining device for short-term drainage (eg, during surgery), or left indwelling for long-term drainage for patients with chronic urinary retention. Patients of all ages may require urethral catheterization, but patients who are elderly or chronically ill are more likely to require indwelling catheters, which carry their own independent risks.\n\n\nThe basic principles underlying urethral catheterization are gender-neutral, but the specific aspects important in the technique of male catheterization are described in this article. For a procedural description for female patients, see Urethral Catheterization in Women.\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe male urethra is a narrow fibromuscular tube that conducts urine and semen from the bladder and ejaculatory ducts, respectively, to the exterior of the body (see the image below). Although the male urethra is a single structure, it is composed of a heterogeneous series of segments: prostatic, membranous, and spongy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMale urethra and its segments. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nKnowledge of male urethral anatomy is essential for all health professionals because urethral catheterization is one of the most commonly performed procedures in health care. The male urethra is susceptible to a variety of pathologic conditions, ranging from traumatic to infectious to neoplastic. Pathophysiologic variants of the urethra may have devastating consequences, such as renal failure and infertility. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Male Urethra Anatomy.\n\nKey Considerations\nProphylactic antibiotics are recommended for patients with prosthetic heart valves, artificial urethral sphincters, or penile implants.\n\nThe maximal recommended volume for urethral balloon inflation can be found on the inflation valve (usually, 10-30 mL).

        "Urethral Catheterization in Women": "\nBackground\n\n\nUrethral catheterization is a routine medical procedure that facilitates direct drainage of the urinary bladder.\n [1] It may be used for diagnostic purposes (to help determine the etiology of various genitourinary conditions) or therapeutically (to relieve urinary retention, instill medication, or provide irrigation). Catheters may be inserted as an in-and-out procedure for immediate drainage, left in with a self-retaining device for short-term drainage (as during surgery), or left indwelling for long-term drainage in patients with chronic urinary retention.\nPatients of all ages may require urethral catheterization, but those who are elderly or chronically ill are more likely to require indwelling catheters, which carry their own independent risks.\n [2] The basic principles underlying urethral catheterization are gender-neutral (see Urethral Catheterization in Men), but certain aspects of the procedure require particular attention in the female urethra.\n\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe developed female urethra is a 4-cm tubular structure that begins at the bladder neck and terminates at the vaginal vestibule (see the image below). It is a richly vascular spongy cylinder and is designed to provide continence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale urinary organs, anterior view. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe female urethra is suspended by the urethropelvic ligament with its 2 sides (the abdominal side being the endopelvic fascia and the vaginal side being the periurethral fascia). The female urethra pierces the pelvic diaphragm and the perineal membrane just posterior to the pubic symphysis. Distally, it exhibits more genital characteristics, becoming rich in glands and developing a squamous epithelium.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Female Urethra Anatomy.

        "Urethrogram": "\nOverview\n\n\nOverview\nA retrograde urethrogram (RUG) is a diagnostic procedure performed most commonly in male patients to diagnose urethral pathology such as trauma to the urethra or urethral stricture.\n [1, 2] \n\n\nIntroduction\nUrethrography is most commonly performed via the retrograde injection of radiopaque contrast into the urethra to elucidate urethral pathology such as rupture of the urethra from trauma or urethral stricture. It is a commonly used procedure in reconstructive urology for operative planning as well as a follow-up procedure after urethral reconstruction. The procedure is less invasive than other diagnostic techniques to examine the urethra, such as urethroscopy.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nTrauma\n\n\n\n\nThe most common indication for a RUG in the setting of trauma is the presence of blood at the urethral meatus after blunt or penetrating trauma. Penile fracture with gross hematuria is also an indication for a RUG to elucidate the presence of a urethral injury. Another relative indication for a RUG is the finding of a “floating prostate” on digital rectal examination, which may indicate urethral disruption. (The prostate normally feels fixed on digital rectal examination, and if the prostate is mobile or “floating,” a urethral disruption may have occurred.) A RUG would diagnose the nature of the injury.\n\nLower urinary tract symptoms\n\nMale patients with a previous history of urethral stricture who have symptoms of urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and poor bladder emptying are at risk for a urethral stricture.\n\nPostoperative evaluation\n\nA RUG is often performed for the imaging and evaluation of the urethral after a surgical procedure such a urethroplasty.\n [3] \n\nContraindications\nRelative contraindications to RUG is a patient allergic to radiopaque contrast. However, because a properly performed RUG does not inject contrast into the vascular system, some practitioners may proceed carefully with RUG in these patients. Premedication with steroids, histamine-1 receptor blockers (such as cimetidine) and histamine-2 receptor blockers (such as Benadryl) may be given preoperatively to decrease the chance of allergic reaction. The procedure should not be performed with patients who have an active urinary tract infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Vaginal Sling Procedures": "\nOverview\n\n\nVaginal/urethral sling is a procedure used to manage stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which is an underdiagnosed and underreported medical problem.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects 15-60% of women. SUI is a disorder that affects both young and elderly individuals. For example, more than one-fourth of nulliparous young college athletes experience SUI when participating in sports.\nBecause of social stigma, an estimated 50-70% of women with urinary incontinence fail to seek medical evaluation and treatment. Of individuals with urinary incontinence, only 5% in the general community and 2% in nursing homes receive appropriate medical evaluation and treatment. Patients with urinary incontinence often endure this condition for 6-9 years before seeking medical therapy.\n\n\nHistorically, female SUI was broadly subcategorized into types I, II, and III, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nType I SUI is defined as urine loss occurring in the absence of significant urethral hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. This is the mildest form of SUI.\n\n\n\n\nType II SUI is defined as urine loss occurring due to urethral hypermobility. This is also known as genuine stress urinary incontinence (GSUI).\n\n\n\n\nType III SUI is defined as urine leakage occurring from an intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). ISD is a more complex form of female SUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subcategories of female SUI can be ascertained by direct physical examination and by measuring an abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP). ALPP, also known as the Valsalva or stress leak point pressure,\n [7, 8] is defined as the lowest abdominal pressure necessary to cause urine leakage.\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely cut-offs vary, but traditionally, an ALPP less than 60 cm water is considered diagnostic of type III SUI, whereas an ALPP of 90-120 cm water is consistent with type II SUI. Values of 60-90 cm water reflect the presence of both type II and type III, in combination. An ALPP greater than 120 cm water is considered diagnostic of type I SUI.\n\nRecent experience suggests that leak point pressures need not be stratified as they were in the past, as slings manage all types of SUI. The types of incontinence just listed are noted for descriptive and historical purposes only.\n [9]  Once thought to be two separate components, urethral hypermobility and ISD are now recognized as two points on a continuum.\n [10] \n\nGo to Nonsurgical Treatment of Urinary Incontinence and Surgical Treatment of Urinary Incontinence for complete information on these topics.\n\nSling procedures\nSlings have excellent overall success and durable cure rates (see the image below). The sling augments the resting urethral closure pressure with increases in intra-abdominal pressure that happen with \"stress maneuvers\" such as coughing, sneezing, and laughing. \n\nSeveral sling options have been described and are used in current practice, including autologous fascial slings and mid-urethral synthetic mesh sling. Whatever sling surgery is performed, one should use the technique that produces the best outcomes in the hands of that particular surgeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLead-pipe urethra (Figure a) converted to normal urethra with excellent mucosal coaptation (Figure b) by means of proper sling surgery. Surgery cured this patient of stress urinary incontinence. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAutologous Pubovaginal Fascial Sling \n\nVon Giordano is usually credited with performing the first pubovaginal sling operation in 1907, using a gracilis muscle graft around the urethra. In 1910, Goebel described treating SUI by rotating the pyramidalis muscles such that their insertion to the pubic bone was conserved, but the ends were joined together below the bladder neck and urethra.\n [11]  In 1914, Frangenheim modified the Goebel’s procedure by incorporating the aponeurosis of the abdominal rectus muscles into the sling of the pyramidalis muscles.\n [12]  Adopting these earlier techniques, McGuire was the first to describe a modern version of the pubovaginal sling (PVS) in the 1970s, using a strip of rectus fascia that remained attached laterally on one side.\n [13]  The contemporary technique of harvesting a free graft from the rectus fascia, developed by Blavias and Jacobs in 1991 allowed for the ability to tension the PVS.\n [14] \n\nHistorically, surgeons have used the rectus fascia or fascial lata pubovaginal sling for the treatment of ISD, complex SUI, or after a failed anti-incontinence operation. There has been a recent increase in the use of the autologous sling given the Food and Drug Administration's Public Health Notification regarding the use of transvaginal mesh for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse.\n [15] \n\nMid-Urethral Slings\n\nBased on the \"Hammock theory\" of stress urinary incontinence, in which the pubocervical fascia provides hammock-like support for the bladder neck and thereby creates a backboard for compression of the proximal urethra during increased intra-abdominal pressure, a new type of sling to treat SUI emerged.\n [16]  The tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) was developed in Europe in the 1990s. The TVT is a polypropylene-meshed tape that is placed at the mid-urethra.\n [17]  With the introduction of the TVT, it became the most common anti-incontinence procedure first in Europe and then in the United States.\n [18]  \n\nThe TVT is placed using a retropubic approach, in which two needles are placed behind the pubic bone, travel through the space of Retzius, and exit through an incision in the anterior vaginal wall. Since the introduction of the TVT, several modifications have been made to the surgical approach. The transobturator tape (TOT) was developed to decrease the risk of bladder injury. More recently, is the development of the single-incision sling (SIS), or \"mini-sling\" in which the mesh is anchored to the endopelvic fascia (with a retropubic approach) or the obturator membrane and muscles (with a transobturator approach). \n\nIndications\nThe indications for sling surgery in women are bothersome SUI that affects the quality of life and potential incontinence in a patient undergoing prolapse repair. When conservative treatment measures, including diet modification, pelvic floor exercises, smoking cessation, and weight loss, have failed, the sling can be considered. \n\nContraindications\nA clear contraindication to sling surgery is pure urge incontinence or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) in which urge is the predominant component. An inherent risk of any sling procedure is de novo or worsening urge symptoms, Thus, surgeons must identify and treat the presence of an urge component before surgery.\n\nConversely, poor detrusor function is a relative contraindication to sling surgery because the potential for urinary retention is increased. Women with absent or poor detrusor function in the presence of SUI are at a higher risk of experiencing prolonged postoperative urinary retention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n"

Left ventricular function can be further evaluated during stress by using atrial pacing, dynamic exercise, or pharmacologic agents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy": "\nBackground\n\n\nCardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), also known as biventricular pacing or multisite ventricular pacing, involves simultaneous pacing of the right ventricle (RV) and the left ventricle (LV). In addition to a conventional RV endocardial lead (with or without a right atrial [RA] lead), CRT involves an additional coronary sinus (CS) lead placed for LV pacing. (See Permanent Pacemaker Insertion.)\n\nCRT has made a dramatic impact on the treatment of most patients with heart failure (HF) and an abnormal QRS duration. It was introduced in the 1990s and revolutionized therapy for many patients with persistent symptoms of systolic HF. The basic goal of CRT is to restore LV synchrony in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and a widened QRS, which is predominantly a result of left bundle branch block, thereby improving mechanical functioning of the LV. (Ie, The aim of CRT is to restore mechanical synchrony by electrically activating the heart in a synchronized manner.) This involves placement of a CS lead for LV pacing, in addition to placement of a conventional RV endocardial lead, with or without a (right atrial) lead.\n\nThere is strong evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that CRT combined with optimal medical therapy improves HF symptoms, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and quality of life (QOL), while decreasing HF hospitalizations and reducing mortality.\n [2] \n\nThe QRS complex on a surface 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) represents ventricular depolarization. The QRS duration (QRSd) is the most readily available marker of ventricular dyssynchrony. A prolonged QRS has been shown to be a marker for atrioventricular, interventricular, and intraleft ventricular dyssynchronies.\n [3] The net result of these disturbances in timing of cardiac contraction is decreased pump function. The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) guidelines recommend use of cardiac resynchronization therapy for a QRS duration longer than 120 ms on the 12-lead ECG as a marker of ventricular dyssynchrony.\n [4, 5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Cardioverter-Defibrillator Implantation": "\nBackground\n\n\nCardiovascular diseases are responsible for approximately 17.7 million deaths in the world every year,\n [4] with 25% from sudden cardiac death (SCD).\n [5]  The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is first-line treatment and prophylaxis for patients who are at risk of SCD. Multiple randomized trials have consistently demonstrated ICD implantation decreases mortality in patients who have suffered cardiac arrest, those with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, and patients with specific structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), sarcoidosis, and others.\n [1, 2, 3] \n\nIndications and techniques for ICD implantation have changed tremendously since the inception of this therapy in 1980.\n [6] Initially, most of the patients who received ICD therapy either showed evidence of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), or they were survivors of SCD.\n [1, 7] At that time, thoracotomy was required for placement of epicardial defibrillation patches, and the large pulse generator (PG)/device size limited implantation sites to the upper abdomen.\n\nThe development of transvenous leads and the miniaturization of the PG allowed for pectoral placement of the defibrillator PG with a very low risk of complications. At present, most ICD placements now occur for primary prevention of SCD.\n [2, 3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Catheter Ablation": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nRadiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has revolutionized treatment for tachyarrhythmias and has become first-line therapy for some tachycardias. Although developed in the 1980s and widely applied in the 1990s, formalized guidelines for its use in clinical practice were not developed until some years later.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \n\n\nCatheters were first used for intracardiac recording and stimulation in the late 1960s, but surgical treatment for refractory tachyarrhythmias was the mainstay of nonpharmacologic therapy until it was superseded by catheter ablation. The initial energy source used was direct current (DC) from a standard external defibrillator. A shock was delivered between the distal catheter electrode and a cutaneous surface electrode; however, this high-voltage discharge was difficult to control and could cause extensive tissue damage.\nRF energy, a low-voltage, high-frequency form of electrical energy familiar to physicians from its use in surgery (eg, electrocautery), quickly supplanted DC ablation. The relative safety of RF energy has contributed to the widespread adoption of catheter ablation as a therapeutic modality.\n\n\n\n\nRF energy produces small, homogeneous, necrotic lesions by heating tissue. Lesion size is influenced, in part, by the length of the distal ablation electrode and the type of catheter (standard vs saline-cooled). With typical power settings and good catheter contact pressure with cardiac tissue, lesions are minimally about 5-7 mm in diameter and 3-5 mm in depth.\n\n\n\n\nCatheter-based cryoablation was developed after RFCA, and it utilizes tissue cooling to cause tissue necrosis. Low-intensity cooling (cryomapping, -10°C) allows assessment of lesion efficacy and safety, prior to delivering the deeper cooling (-70°C) that causes irreversible tissue necrosis. Though not as versatile or widely used compared to RFCA, cryoablation is safer for ablation near the compact atrioventricular (AV) node.\n\nA cryoballoon has been developed for pulmonary vein isolation, the minimal objective in catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, and it appears roughly comparable to point to point RFCA.\n [8, 9, 10] The Fire and Ice Trial demonstrated noninferiority between cryoballoon and RFCA for the treatment of drug-refractory symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, as well as comparable safety and efficacy, but cryoablation had a shorter procedure time, left atrial dwell time, and total fluoroscopy time that RFCA.\n [8, 9, 10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Comparison of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe ideal treatment for ischemic coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a matter of debate. The two primary modalities for revascularization are coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This article briefly discusses the history, indications, applications, and current status of these revascularization procedures. Rapid advances are being made in both PCI and surgical revascularization, and such advances are likely to continue in the years to come.\nSeveral studies have shown that mechanical revascularization by either CABG or PCI is more effective in relieving angina and improving quality of life.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\n\nThe ORBITA (Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation with optimal medical Therapy of Angioplasty in stable angina) trial randomized PCI with placebo in patients with stable coronary artery disease due to single-vessel CAD in the presence of moderate angina.\n [7] This study outlined that symptomatic relief in that cohort might be at least partly due to placebo effect and, importantly, it emphasized the role of optimal medical therapy (OMT).\nWhile bioabsorbable stents have not lived up to the promise and have been pulled out of the market,\n [8] bioabsorbable stents continue to hold promise. Bioabsorbable magnesium stents are being evaluated.\n [9, 10] The advantages of biodegradable polymers include high drug-loading capacity, controlled long-term drug release, and full degradation of the polymer over a defined period, resulting in full release of the drug during a well-controlled time interval.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nThromboresistant polymer coatings based on biologic substances such as fibrin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and biologic oils are being tested. These polymers serve as drug delivery reservoirs for drugs that inhibit neointimal hyperplasia through suppression of platelet activation and the inflammatory response and through inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of variable dose and release kinetics of drugs on neointimal hyperplasia is also being studied.\n [11] Multiple drugs may be delivered at timed intervals through newly designed stents.\n\nGene-eluting stents\n [12] are undergoing experimental and clinical trials; these will be usable either alone or in conjunction with other drug-eluting stents (DESs) and may further reduce in-stent restenosis (ISR). The ABSORB trial studied the safety of the bioabsorbable everolimus-eluting stent.\n [13] At 2 years, the stent was bioabsorbed, with vasomotion restored and restenosis prevented, and was clinically safe, suggesting freedom from late thrombosis.\n\nThe TRITON-TIMI 38 trial\n [14] showed that in patients with acute coronary syndromes with scheduled PCI, prasugrel therapy was associated with significantly reduced rates of ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, but with an increased risk of major bleeding, including fatal bleeding. Overall mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Prasugrel has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Other antithrombotics are in the pipeline.\n\nMost acute coronary syndromes are caused by rupture of unstable plaques of mild-to-moderate stenosis (< 50%).\n [15] Stenting of such vulnerable lesions might result in stabilization and prevention of plaque rupture. Likewise, rapid advances have been made in surgical techniques. In the future, PCI and CABG may come to be seen as complementary techniques for myocardial revascularization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting": "\nBackground\n\n\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is performed for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) to improve quality of life and reduce cardiac-related mortality. CAD is the leading cause of mortality in the United States\n [10] and the developed world,\n [11] and 16.5 million US adults (age ≥20 years) are affected by this disease annually.\n [10]  It alone accounts for 530,989 deaths each year in the United States, and the long-term manifestations of CAD with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure are projected to affect over 8 million people aged at least 18 years by 2030.\n [10] \n\nCABG was introduced in the 1960s with the aim of offering symptomatic relief, improved quality of life, and increased life expectancy to patients with CAD.\n [12, 13] By the 1970s, CABG was found to increase survival rates in patients with multivessel disease and left main disease when compared with medical therapy.\n [14] \n\nThe relatively new paradigm for treatment of CAD calls for a heart team approach that involves the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon evaluating the coronary angiogram together and offering the best possible option to the patient to achieve coronary revascularization, whether it be placement of a percutaneous coronary stent or CABG. It is recommended that Individuals under consideration for CABG undergo Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk stratification.\n [1]  Evaluation of CAD complexity in patients with multivessel CAD using tools such as the SYNTAX (Synergy Between PCI With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) score may be useful in guiding revacularization.\n [1] \n\nAt present, the typical patient for CABG is older, is more likely to have undergone previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and has significantly more comorbidities. Despite these adverse risk factors, CABG continues to be one of the most important surgical procedures in the history of modern medicine and probably has prolonged more lives and provided more significant symptomatic relief than any other major operation in medicine. Newer, less-invasive options, advancement in anesthetic and intensive care unit (ICU) management, and technological advances are pushing the boundaries of this procedure to new heights.\n\nHistorical information\nAlexis Carrel received the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine for his work in 1912. His understanding of the association between angina pectoris and coronary artery stenosis allowed him to anastomose a carotid artery segment to the left coronary artery from the descending thoracic aorta in canine model.\n [15] \n\nIn the late 1940s, the famous Canadian surgeon Arthur Vineberg implanted the left internal thoracic (mammary) artery, directly into the myocardium of the anterior left ventricle in patients with severe angina pectoralis.\n [16, 17, 18] Surprisingly, this procedure produced significant symptomatic relief in a few patients.\n [19] \n\nIn 1962, Sabiston, at Duke University, performed the first planned saphenous vein bypass operation for coronary revascularization.\n [20]  In 1964, Kolessov used the left internal thoracic (mammary) artery to bypass the left anterior descending artery without cardiopulmonary bypass,\n [21] and, in 1973, Carpentier introduced the use of radial artery grafts as conduits for CABG.\n [22, 23] \n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, CABG flourished as the sole therapy for CAD.  With the advent, introduction, and widespread adoption of percutaneous coronary artery stenting in the 1980s and 1990s there was a decline in the number of CABG operations performed. However, several multicenter studies comparing CABG with current stent therapy have clearly demonstrated the superiority of CABG, especially when certain patient characteristics such as diabetes, multivessel CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy are taken into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

In a comparison of prospectively gated 64- and 256-slice CT scanning, the 256-slice scan provided better and more stable image quality, at equivalent effective radiation dose.\n [2] \n\nRadiation dose\nThe reported effective radiation doses for retrospectively gated, single-source, 64-slice CT scanning have ranged from 9.5-21.4 mSv.\n [3] However, various technologies and techniques have made it possible to lower the dose to less than 5 mSv, and doses of less than 1 mSv are possible in some patients.\n\nPatient preparation\nAt the author’s institution, patients are instructed to avoid caffeine and smoking 12 hours prior to the procedure to avoid cardiac stimulation. They are also instructed to avoid eating solid food 4 hours before the study and to increase fluid intake prior to the exam. Standard precautions with regard to contrast allergy history and renal function are taken.\n\nBeta blockers\n\nBeta-blocker administration is often helpful in cardiac CT scanning to lower the heart rate and decrease motion artifact. The level to which the heart rate should be lowered depends on the temporal resolution of the scan.\n\nHowever, heart rate variability may be a more important determinant of image quality than absolute heart rate.\n [4] Beta blockers are also helpful in patients with irregular heart rates, supraventricular tachycardias, and arrhythmias.\n\nSeveral contraindications to beta-blocker therapy exist, including a heart rate below 60 bpm, a systolic blood pressure below 100 mm Hg, and decompensated cardiac failure, among others.\n\nNitroglycerin\n\nThe administration of sublingual nitroglycerin dilates the coronary arteries and increases side branch visualization.\n [5] Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it and in patients who are taking phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction.\n [6] Patients should not have taken a phosphodiesterase inhibitor for at least 48 hours before the exam.\n\nNitroglycerin can cause orthostatic hypotension; it should be used with caution in patients who have low systolic blood pressure (eg, < 90 mm Hg) and who are volume depleted from diuretic therapy.

        "Echocardiography": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe use of echocardiography as an imaging modality has increased substantially over the past decade. Cardiologists perform most echocardiography studies, with internists being the next most common providers of these studies (15% of all Medicare charges submitted for the procedure).\n [1] The objective of this article is to provide clinicians with a brief review of basic principles and instrumentation of echocardiography.\nNeither bone nor air is a good transmission medium for ultrasound waves; accordingly, specific windows (eg, apical, parasternal, subcostal, and suprasternal) are used to image the heart.\n\n\nTwo-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D echocardiography provide real-time imaging of heart structures throughout the cardiac cycle. Doppler echocardiography provides information on blood movement inside cardiac structures and on hemodynamics.\nTissue Doppler imaging (TDI) provides information about movement of cardiac structures. The relation between the dynamics of cardiac structures and the hemodynamics of the blood inside these structures provides information about cardiac diastolic and systolic function. Echocardiography is continuously evolving and constantly being augmented by newer modalities, such as tissue harmonics, speckle tracking, tissue Doppler strain, and tissue characterization.\n\n\n\n\nThe advent of myocardial perfusion echocardiography (MCE) has allowed​ functional evaluation of the coronary microcirculation, including quantitative coronary blood flow and fractional flow reserve.\n [2] This has helped to improve \"the definition of ischemic burden and the relative contribution of collaterals in noncritical coronary stenosis.\" Moreover, MCE identifies no-reflow within myocardial infarctions (MIs) and low-flow around MIs, predicts potential functional recovery of stunned myocardium with appropriate interventions, and appears to have a diagnostic performance comparable to positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in microvascular reserve/dysfunction in angina patients.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nDedicated training for competent performance and interpretation of echocardiography is essential. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have recommended a set of minimum knowledge and training requirements for the performance and interpretation of echocardiography, including a minimum number of 150 performed and 300 interpreted examinations for basic level II (for level III: 300 performed/750 interpreted) in interpreting echocardiography.\n [3, 4, 5]  Similar guidelines have been developed in Canada.\n [6, 7] \n\nBasic principles of echocardiography\nHumans can hear sound waves with frequencies ranging from 20 to 20,000 cycles per second—that is, from 20 Hertz (Hz) to 20 kHz. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz are referred to as ultrasound. Diagnostic medical ultrasonography usually uses transducers with frequencies of 1-20 MHz. Ultrasound waves are described in terms of the following features:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n\n\n\nWavelength (mm)\n\n\n\n\nAmplitude, or loudness (decibels [dB])\n\n\n\n\nVelocity of propagation (m/sec) - This varies according to the type of tissue medium carrying the wave (it is approximately 1540 m/sec in blood)\n\n\n\nThese phenomena are the basis for many of the clinical applications and calculations of echocardiography.\n\nInteraction of ultrasound waves with tissue results in reflection, scattering, refraction, and attenuation of the waves. 2-D echocardiographic imaging is based on reflection of transmitted ultrasound waves. Doppler analysis is based on the scattering of ultrasound waves from moving blood cells, with a resulting change in the frequency of the waves received at the transducer. Attenuation limits the depth of ultrasound penetration. Refraction, a change in the direction of the ultrasound wave, results in imaging artifacts.\n\nBecause wavelength (λ) times frequency (ƒ) equals the propagation velocity (с), or λ × ƒ = с, and the propagation velocity in the heart is 1540 m/sec, the wavelength for any transducer frequency can be calculated as follows:\n\nλ (mm) = 1.54/ƒ (MHz)\n\nWavelength has clinical importance, in that image resolution cannot be greater than 1-2 wavelengths. That is to say, the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength and the better the image resolution.\n\nThe depth to which ultrasound waves penetrate the body is directly related to wavelength (ie, shorter wavelengths penetrate a shorter distance).\n [8] The depth of penetration for adequate imaging tends to be limited to about 200 wavelengths. Thus, an obvious tradeoff exists between image resolution and depth of penetration. Thus, a 1-MHz transducer has a penetration depth of 30 cm and resolution of 1.5 mm, whereas a 5-MHz transducer has a lesser penetration depth, only 6 cm, but a higher resolution, approximately 0.3 mm.\n\n2-D imaging depends on reflection of ultrasound waves. These waves are reflected at tissue boundaries and interfaces, with the quantity dependent on the relative change in acoustic impedance (ie, density) between the two tissues. Optimal return of reflected ultrasound waves occurs at a perpendicular angle (90°).\n\nDoppler flow imaging depends on the scattering phenomenon, and its optimal flow angle is the opposite of that for 2-D imaging (ie, parallel to the flow of interest, rather than perpendicular). The Doppler effect may be simply stated as follows: A person moving toward a sound source will hear a tone with higher frequency than the emitted wave frequency, whereas a person moving away from the source of sound will hear the tone with a lower frequency than the emitted wave frequency.\n\nAdditional common terms and concepts employed in echocardiography include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nDuty factor - The fraction of time during which a transducer is sending an ultrasound impulse\n\n\n\n\nIntensity - Power divided by area, expressed as watts (W)/cm2\n\n\n\n\nAttenuation - Reduction in intensity with travel, resulting from the effects of absorption plus those of scattering; in tissues, attenuation can be calculated by means of the following equation: 0.5 dB/cm-MHz × depth (cm) × transducer frequency (MHz)\n\n\n\n\nRound-trip travel of an ultrasound beam in tissue - 13 μsec/cm\n\n\n\n\nVariables affecting pulse repetition frequency (PRF) - PRF is limited by the following equation: Depth (cm) × number of foci × lines/frame × frames/sec < 77,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Electrocardiography": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used medical studies in the assessment of cardiovascular disease. It is the most important test for interpretation of the cardiac rhythm, detection of myocardial ischemia and infarction, conduction system abnormalities, preexcitation, long QT syndromes, atrial abnormalities, ventricular hypertrophy, pericarditis, and other conditions.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  The use of standardized terminology is recommended to allow application of ECG diagnoses across many different hospital systems and countries.\n [6] \nSee Are You Missing Subtle MI Clues on ECGs? Test Your Skills, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify a variety of ECG abnormalities.\n\n\nHistory of the ECG\nThe ECG has its roots in the seminal work of Galvani, who famously noted the contraction of frog legs when stimulated with electricity.\n [7]  Although he was incorrect in attributing this phenomenon to \"animal electricity,\" his findings ushered in a period of research in the interaction of electricity and biological systems.\n\n\n\n\nMatteucci, and later Kolliker and Muller, demonstrated that the electrical activity of a beating heart caused synchronous contractions in muscle preparations that were connected to the heart by nerve tissue.\n [8, 9]  Gabriel Lippman developed the capillary electrometer, making it possible to measure the minute currents in biological systems.\n [10] With the Lippman electrometer, Agustus Waller performed the first ECG of a human heart at St Mary’s Hospital in London in May 1887.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nWillem Einthoven improved the ECG using the Lippman electrometer and then introduced the string galvanometer, which represented a great leap forward in electrocardiography.\n [12]  With Einthoven’s improvements, the now familiar P, Q, R, S, and T waves were apparent.\n\nNot only did Einthoven reveal the ECG waveforms as we know them today, but his convention for placement of the ECG leads is still in use, with leads on the right and left arms as well as the left leg, using the right leg as an electrical ground. With these leads, he demonstrated the well-known \"Einthoven’s triangle\" (see the image below).\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI, II and III represent the original three leads used by Einthoven. These describe the electrical vector between the right and left arms, right arm and left leg, and left arm and left leg, respectively. R, L, and F represent the augmented limb leads aVR, aVL, and aVF. They are calculated as follows: aVR = (I+II)/2 , aVL = (I-III)/2, aVF = (II+III)/2.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nOne of Einthoven's students, Sir Thomas Lewis, used electrocardiography to reveal the mechanisms behind atrial fibrillation and other conduction abnormalities. In the United States, Wilson and Goldberger pioneered the use of additional leads, namely aVR, aVL, aVF, and the 6 precordial leads (see the images below).\n [13, 14] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hexagonal reference system is the standard method of determining the axis of electrical activation of the heart.

        "Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) Measurement": "\nBackground\n\n\nFractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement involves determining the ratio between the maximum achievable blood flow in a diseased coronary artery and the theoretical maximum flow in a normal coronary artery. An FFR of 1.0 is widely accepted as normal. An FFR lower than 0.75-0.80 is generally considered to be associated with myocardial ischemia (MI).\n [1] \nFFR is easily measured during routine coronary angiography by using a pressure wire to calculate the ratio between coronary pressure distal to a coronary artery stenosis and aortic pressure under conditions of maximum myocardial hyperemia.\n [1] This ratio represents the potential decrease in coronary flow distal to the coronary stenosis. More recently, computed tomography (CT)-based FFR computations have been used to evaluate the functional severity of coronary artery stenoses, with FFRs derived from outflow boundary conditions based on conventional morphology generally agreeing with those based on positron-emission tomography (PET) conditions.\n [2]  However, FFRs measurements based on conventional morphology had a tendency to overestimate functional severity, particularly in the setting of reduced vasodilatory response under hyperemia (and thus abnomal myocardial perfusion).\n [2] \n\n\nOver the past two decades, FFR measurement has been increasingly used in cardiac catheterization laboratories. It provides a quantitative assessment of the functional severity of a coronary artery stenosis identified during coronary angiography and cardiac catheterization.\nA severe coronary artery stenosis can limit myocardial blood flow, resulting in MI. In most cases, the severity of a coronary artery stenosis is judged by visual inspection by the cardiologist during cardiac angiography. A lesion is generally considered severe and flow-limiting if the narrowing of the luminal diameter is estimated to be 70% or greater.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nDuring angiography, the cardiologist typically assesses the patient’s symptoms and clinical characteristics, evaluates the angiographic appearance of the coronary tree, and then decides whether revascularization with angioplasty, stenting, or coronary bypass surgery is most appropriate.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nHowever, the ability of the cardiologist to discriminate between lesions that can cause MI and lesions that are physiologically insignificant on the basis of coronary angiography alone is limited.\n [4] The use of FFR measurement provides the cardiologist with a straightforward, readily available, quantitative technique for evaluating the physiologic significance of a coronary stenosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Heart Sounds": "\nOverview\n\n\nCardiovascular diseases continue to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One of the first steps in evaluating the cardiovascular system after detailed history taking is physical examination. Auscultation of the heart forms the core of cardiac physical examination. Despite significant interobserver variability and need for habituation and training, cardiac auscultation provides important initial clues in patient evaluation and serves as a guide for further diagnostic testing.\nSome of the common mechanisms by which heart sounds are generated include (1) opening or closure of the heart valves, (2) flow of blood through the valve orifice, (3) flow of blood into the ventricular chambers, and (4) rubbing of cardiac surfaces.\n\n\nThe main anatomic areas to focus on while initially evaluating heart sounds include the cardiac apex, the aortic area (second intercostal space [ICS] just to the right of the sternum or the third ICS just to the left of sternum), the pulmonary area (second ICS just to the left of sternum) and the tricuspid area (fourth and fifth ICS just to the left of sternum).\n [1] In addition, auscultation of the left axilla, base of the heart, carotid arteries, and interscapular area should be performed to assess for radiation of heart sounds and murmurs.\nThe patient should be examined in the supine position, in the left lateral decubitus position, and while sitting and leaning forward. Each area should be systematically auscultated for S1, S2, physiologic splitting, respiratory variations, and any accessory sounds during systole and diastole.\n [2] Whenever possible, auscultation should be accompanied by having the patient perform dynamic maneuvers such as standing, Valsalva, squatting, and hand grip, although these maneuvers are falling out of favor with the use of echocardiography.\n\n\n\n\nWhile interpreting the heart sounds, it is essential to understand from which part of the cardiac cycle they are being generated. This can be done by palpating the carotid artery simultaneously while auscultating the heart. The carotid upstroke corresponds to ventricular systole.\n\n\n\n\nMore recently, murmur recognition systems, neural networks, heart sound classification models, and other modalities have been developed and are under investigation to accurately identify heart sound patterns in children and adults, with and without congenital heart disease.\n [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] A real-time heart rate signal detection using an electronic stethoscope is also being evaluated.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Intra-aortic Balloon Counterpulsation": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is the most common form of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) used in the setting of myocardial ischemia and cardiogenic shock.\n [1, 2] This method of temporary mechanical circulatory support attempts to create a more favorable balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand by using the concepts of systolic unloading and diastolic augmentation. As a consequence, cardiac output, ejection fraction, and coronary perfusion are increased, with a concomitant decrease in left ventricular (LV) wall stress, systemic resistance to LV ejection, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). The following review discusses the hemodynamic, clinical, and technical aspects of this important modality for hemodynamic support.\nHistory of the procedure\nThe principle of aortic counterpulsation was originally described by Dr Adrian Kantrowitz in 1959 using a dog model​ in which the hemidiaphragm was wrapped around the thoracic aorta,\n [2, 3] which, by electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve, was made to contract during diastole. Altering the pressure characteristics of the cardiac cycle by augmenting diastolic pressure was postulated to improve coronary perfusion and take over as much as 25% of the pumping burden of the natural heart.\n\n\nThe modern intra-aortic counterpulsation device, which consists of a balloon mounted on a flexible catheter, was described by Moulopoulos et al at the Cleveland Clinic in 1962.\n [2, 4] The original description was of a latex tube tied around a polyethylene catheter with side holes. Carbon dioxide was used to inflate the balloon regulated via a 3-way solenoid valve.\n [2, 4] Balloon inflation occurred for a predetermined duration and was timed using the R wave on the electrocardiogram.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1971, Krakauer et al working with Adrian Kantrowitz described their experience in 30 patients who received intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support for cardiogenic shock secondary to myocardial infarction (MI) refractory to pharmacologic therapy.\n [5] In this series, most patients (25 of 30) achieved hemodynamic stabilization and reversal of shock after the introduction of counterpulsation. In the subgroup of patients developing medically refractory shock within the first 12 hours of infarction, 9 of the 20 survived to hospital discharge.\n [6] \nFrequency\nIn the decades following their introduction, the IABP became an important adjunctive therapy in the management of cardiogenic shock, particularly in the setting of an acute MI. In the seminal SHOCK trial, published in 1999, IABP was used in 86% of patients, regardless of whether they were revascularized or not.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nIn relatively recent years, the efficacy of IABP support in cardiogenic shock has come into question.\n [8] Data from 1998 compared to 2008 showed that IABP support of patients in cardiogenic shock fell from 36.5% in 1998 to 13.4% in 2008 (P< 0.0001).\n [9] In a large 2009-2013 study comprising data from 76,474 patients, Sandhu et al found 39% were supported with IABP while undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the setting of cardiogenic shock.\n [10] The authors noted, however, that there was large variation across centers. In a study using the CathPCI Registry, IABP was used in 10.5% of all high-risk PCIs, whether due to unprotected left main artery as the target vessel, cardiogenic shock, severely depressed LV function, or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\n [11] \n\nMore recently, a study that analyzed ongoing prospective, observational data from the North American COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) Myocardial Infarction (NACMI) registry to determine the frequency and clinical impact of MCS on STEMI that complicated COVID-19 found that IABP was the most frequently used MCS device in those with and those without COVID-19.\n [12]  Those with COVID-19 and STEMI who received an IABP had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality than individuals with STEMI but without COVID. \n\nPathophysiology\nThe IABP improves many of the hemodynamic perturbations of circulatory failure and cardiogenic shock.\n [13] Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of this dramatic manifestation of heart failure is important. Cardiogenic shock is characterized by end-organ tissue hypoperfusion, which initiates a series of counter-regulatory mechanisms. The classic understanding of the interplay between the underlying pathophysiology and counter-regulatory mechanisms is that of a downward spiral in which compensatory mechanisms such as peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and neurohormonal regulatory activation contribute to further worsening of left ventricular failure (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntra-aortic Balloon Counterpulsation. The downward spiral of cardiogenic shock. Myocardial injury leads initially to diastolic dysfunction resulting in increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), LV wall stress, and pulmonary congestion. The onset of systolic dysfunction sets in motion a cascade of reflex mechanisms and consequences of low cardiac output that exacerbate myocardial ischemia and myocardial dysfunction.

Annals of Internal Medicine. 1999; 131(1): 47-59.) \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nWhile a comprehensive discussion of the hemodynamics of cardiogenic shock is beyond the scope of this review, it is worthwhile to note the following:\n\nCardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death from acute myocardial infarction. According to data from the SHOCK registry, the mortality from cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction is 50-80%.\n [14] In addition, data indicate that anterior myocardial infarction is the most common territory leading to cardiogenic shock. In the SHOCK registry, 55% of infarctions were anterior.\n [14] Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed at the bedside by observing the clinical signs of end-organ hypoperfusion such as altered mental status, cool and mottled extremities, and oliguria. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating hemodynamic criteria consistent with myocardial dysfunction.\n\nMechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction can precipitate cardiogenic shock or contribute to preexisting cardiogenic shock. These include acute mitral regurgitation, postinfarction ventricular septal defect, and left ventricular free wall rupture. For more information, see Medscape Drugs & Diseases article Complications of Myocardial Infarction.\n\nCatecholamine vasopressors to treat hypotension in the setting of cardiogenic shock should be used judiciously to maintain coronary perfusion pressure but also minimize additional myocardial oxygen demand through increasing afterload and genesis of dysrhythmias.\n\nReperfusion of ischemic myocardium has been shown to provide long-term survival benefit in the setting of cardiogenic shock related to acute myocardial infarction.\n [14] \n\nThe above highlights of cardiogenic shock pathophysiology set the stage for the following discussion of counterpulsation hemodynamics.\n\nEffects of counterpulsation on systemic hemodynamics\nThe intra-aortic balloon, by inflating during diastole, displaces blood volume from the thoracic aorta. In systole, as the balloon rapidly deflates, this creates a dead space, effectively reducing afterload for myocardial ejection and improving forward flow from the left ventricle. The net effect is to decrease systolic aortic pressure by as much as 20% and increase diastolic pressure.\n [15] In a multicenter trial of counterpulsation in cardiogenic shock, a mean 30 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure was observed with no significant change in heart rate.\n\nThe IABP pressure tracing in the image below shows the systemic hemodynamic effects of counterpulsation in a 2:1 configuration, whereby every other beat is assisted by balloon inflation. Notice the increase in diastolic pressure, the decrease in peak systolic pressure on the postassisted beat, and the decrease in aortic end-diastolic pressure on the assisted beat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntra-aortic Balloon Counterpulsation. Annotated arterial pressure tracing obtained from intra-aortic balloon pump set to a 2:1 ratio. Notice the increase in diastolic pressure, the decrease in peak systolic pressure on the postassisted beat, and the decrease in aortic end-diastolic pressure on the assisted beat. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe net effect on myocardial mechanics is to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, increase cardiac output, and lower peak left ventricular wall stress.\n [16] The magnitude of counterpulsation hemodynamic effect depends on several factors, including the relation of balloon volume to aorta size, heart rate and rhythm, and aortic compliance.\n [17] In addition, diastolic augmentation is most efficient the closer the balloon is to the aortic valve.\n [18] To minimize the risk of cerebral embolism, the ideal IABP position in modern practice is 1 or 2 centimeters distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.\n\nEffect of counterpulsation on coronary perfusion\nIn theory, the augmentation of diastolic pressure by counterpulsation should be transmitted to the epicardial coronary circulation, leading to an increase in myocardial perfusion. However, the data suggest that the degree of coronary artery stenosis and the state of coronary autoregulation cause significant variation in response to counterpulsation. Kimura et al, using an anesthetized dog model, showed that diastolic forward flow in the left anterior descending (LAD) increased by 12% during counterpulsation. However, with partial ligation of the left main to create a critical stenosis, the effect of counterpulsation to augment LAD flow was completely abolished.\n [19] In human subjects, data regarding augmentation of coronary flow by counterpulsation is inconsistent.\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) Doppler tracings from epicardial vessels obtained in patients with an IABP have shown increased Doppler velocities, suggesting augmented coronary flow.\n [20] The effect of diastolic augmentation on post-stenotic coronary flow has also been assessed using a Doppler angioplasty guidewire in patients undergoing angioplasty.\n\nKern studied coronary flow in 15 patients with a mean vessel narrowing of 95%. No significant increase in coronary flow augmentation was demonstrated in the post-stenotic segment, but angioplasty restored the effect of counterpulsation to augment coronary flow.\n [21] Because of the severity of luminal obstruction present in the population studied, the use of a guidewire beyond the stenosis may have adversely affected flow measurements. In addition, conclusions cannot be drawn regarding flow augmentation beyond less severe stenoses, since these were not studied.\n\nTakeuchi addressed this issue by comparing 40 patients undergoing counterpulsation for typical indications using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to measure coronary flow velocity. Analysis of the data stratified by lesion severity showed enhanced distal vessel flow regardless of the degree of stenosis present.\n [22] Nonetheless, a major contributor to the relief of ischemia by counterpulsation is via its effect to decrease afterload, left ventricular wall stress, and myocardial oxygen demand.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe IABP is commonly introduced via the common femoral artery using a Seldinger technique. If placed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, fluoroscopy is often used to confirm correct position of the device, but a chest radiograph can be used to confirm position after placement if fluoroscopy is not available. The tip of the balloon should be positioned 1-2 centimeters distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. In the case of blind placement, the take-off of the left subclavian artery can be identified using the second rib as a landmark. The caudal end of the balloon should be positioned above the origin of the renal arteries. In most patients, the right and left renal arteries arise between the first and second lumbar vertebral bodies.\n [23] \n\nThe first image below shows a chest radiograph from a patient with an IABP in place with the major landmarks vital for proper positioning highlighted. The second image shows intra-arterial positioning of an IABP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntra-aortic Balloon Counterpulsation.

        "Left Ventricular Assist Device Insertion": "\nBackground\n\n\nOver the past several years, there has been a dramatic shift from the use of large pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to the use of smaller continuous-flow devices for the provision of mechanical circulatory support in patients with heart failure.\n [1] However, the fundamental issues related to surgical implantation remain the same. That is, most devices use the apex of the left ventricle (LV) as the inflow site to the pump, which subsequently gives off an outflow graft to the aorta, thus bypassing the ailing LV.\nThis article describes some of the issues related to implantation of LVADs. Although many types of devices are currently available, they do not differ significantly with regard to general implantation technique. Accordingly, this article focuses on the device currently dominant in the United States, the Thoratec HeartMate II. Other devices approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include the Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, New York, NY) and the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System\n [2] (HeartWare, Framingham, MA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Patent Ductus Arteriosus Surgery": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a persistent communication between the descending thoracic aorta and the pulmonary artery that results from failure of normal physiologic closure of the fetal ductus (see the image below). In most individuals, the ductus arteriosus is located on the left side; however, if a right aortic arch is present, the ductus arteriosus may be located on the right or left side. The ductus arteriosus is very rarely bilateral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus Surgery. Patent ductus arteriosus. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nIn normal fetal circulation, the unexpanded lungs receive only 5-8% of the blood entering the pulmonary artery. The ductus arteriosus serves as the predominant route of circulation passing through the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Approximately 55-60% of the systemic circulation passes from right to left through the ductus.\n\n\n\n\nIn the fetus, the oxygen tension is relatively low because the pulmonary system is nonfunctional. This, coupled with high levels of circulating prostaglandins, acts to keep the ductus open. The high levels of prostaglandins result from the little amount of pulmonary circulation and the high levels of production in the placenta.\n\n\n\n\nAt birth, the placenta is removed, eliminating a major source of prostaglandin production, and the lungs expand, activating the organ in which most prostaglandins are metabolized. In addition, with the onset of normal respiration, oxygen tension in the blood markedly increases. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreases with this activity. These events result in contraction of the smooth muscle within the wall of the ductus, which results in its closure.\n\nA preferential shift of blood flow occurs; the blood moves away from the ductus and directly from the right ventricle into the lungs. Until functional closure is complete and pulmonary vascular resistance is lower than systemic vascular resistance, some residual left-to-right flow occurs from the aorta through the ductus and into the pulmonary arteries.\n\nIn normal-birth-weight and full-term neonates, the ductus arteriosus closes within 3 days after birth. However, the ductus arteriosus is patent for more than 3 days after birth in 80% of preterm neonates weighing less than 750 g, and its persistent patency is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, in the presence of a significant left-to-right ductal shunt in low-birth-weight neonates, a decreased peripheral perfusion and oxygen delivery occurs.\n\nAlthough PDA is frequently diagnosed in infants, it may not be discovered until childhood or even adulthood. In isolated PDA, signs and symptoms are consistent with left-to-right shunting. The shunt volume is determined by the size of the open communication and the pulmonary vascular resistance. PDA may exist with other cardiac anomalies, which must be considered at the time of diagnosis. In many cases, the diagnosis and treatment of a PDA is critical for survival in neonates with severe obstructive lesions to either the right or left side of the heart.\n\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment for PDA that does not close spontaneously or with pharmacologic therapy.\n [1] Two forms of surgical therapy are performed: the traditional surgical approach, which entails a thoracotomy (or alternatively, thoracoscopy), and catheter closure.\n\nTranscatheter closure of PDA has become increasingly popular due to the development of more sophisticated catheter methodologies and devices.\n [2, 3, 4] Smaller catheters have improved outcomes in preterm infants, a population previously excluded from the procedure.\n [2, 3] The traditional surgical approach is used when a catheter approach is not possible.\n\nPharmacologic therapy options in the closure of a PDA include intravenous (IV) indomethacin or ibuprofen and, more recently, antenatal corticosteroids and exogenous surfactant.\n [5] Preterm infants who are small for gestational age are more likely to require PDA surgery following pharmacologic treatment.\n [6] \n\nIndications\nIn infancy, congestive heart failure is an indication for closure of the PDA. If medical therapy is ineffective, urgent intervention to close the structure should be undertaken. Repair may be delayed in the patient who is asymptomatic or well controlled on medical therapy. All PDAs should be closed because of the risk of bacterial endocarditis associated with the open structure. Over time, the increased pulmonary blood flow precipitates pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, which is ultimately fatal.\n\nIf an infant has failed to thrive or has overt congestive heart failure, the ductus should be interrupted, regardless of age and size. If the patient is asymptomatic, elective ligation and division can be carried out at approximately age 4 years when the risks of intubation are decreased and the child is more capable of understanding the procedure and process. Some authorities recommend closure any time after age 12 months or when the patient becomes symptomatic.\n\nContraindications\nRelatively few contraindications to closure of a PDA are recognized. The primary contraindication to repair is severe pulmonary vascular disease. If transient intraoperative occlusion of the PDA does not decrease elevated pulmonary arterial pressures with a subsequent increase in aortic pressure, then the closure must be undertaken carefully and may be contraindicated. Closure of the ductus does not reverse preexisting pulmonary vascular disease.\n\nA subset of associated cardiac anomalies—so-called ductal-dependent lesions—depend on flow through the PDA to maintain systemic blood flow. Premature closure of the ductus without concurrent repair of the following defects is contraindicated and may be fatal:\n\n\n\n\n\nPulmonary artery hypoplasia\n\n\n\n\nPulmonary atresia\n\n\n\n\nTricuspid atresia\n\n\n\n\nTransposition of the great arteries\n\n\n\n\nAortic valve atresia\n\n\n\n\nMitral valve atresia with hypoplastic left ventricle\n\n\n\n\nSevere coarctation of the aorta\n\n\n\nIn these patients, all attempts should be made to preserve ductal flow until a more permanent palliative shunt can be constructed or definitive repair can be undertaken.\n\nContraindications to catheter closure currently involve the size of the patient. Very small premature infants still require surgical closure. Contraindications to surgical closure include concurrent uncontrolled sepsis and an inability of the patient to tolerate general anesthesia.\n\nOutcomes\nThe prognosis is generally considered excellent in patients in whom the PDA is the only problem. The mortality from surgical closure is less than 0.5%. No deaths have been reported from catheter closure; however, patients undergoing this procedure are part of a select group and have a generally good prognosis otherwise.\n\nIf additional cardiac anomalies are present, the risk increases. A high risk is reported in the presence of associated lesions, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, or when the ductus is calcified or aneurysmal.\n\nIn premature infants who have other sequelae of prematurity, these sequelae tend to dictate prognosis of PDA. Studies have shown that preterm babies with a gestational age of 30 weeks or younger had a 72% rate of spontaneous closure of PDA. In addition, 28% of children with PDA who were conservatively treated (with prophylactic ibuprofen) reported a 94% closure rate. This rate compared well with rates reported in literature following medical treatment (80-92%). Surgical mortality in premature infants ranges from 20% to 41%.\n\nIn the adult patient, prognosis is more dependent on the condition of the pulmonary vasculature and the status of the myocardium if congestive cardiomyopathy was present before ductal closure. Patients with minimal or reactive pulmonary hypertension and limited myocardial changes may have a normal life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction to ECMO\nThe term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initially used to describe long-term extracorporeal support that focused on the function of oxygenation. Subsequently, in some patients, the emphasis shifted to carbon dioxide removal, and the term extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal was coined. Extracorporeal support was later used for postoperative support in patients following cardiac surgery.\n [1] Other variations of its capabilities have been tested and used over the last few years, making it an important tool in the armamentarium of life and organ support measures for clinicians. With all of these uses for extracorporeal circuitry, a new term, extracorporeal life support (ECLS), has come into vogue to describe this technology.\n\n\nSee Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Complex Clinical Condition, a Critical Images slideshow, for more information on this life-threatening condition characterized by acute respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema.\nThe differences between ECMO and cardiopulmonary bypass are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nECMO is frequently instituted using only cervical cannulation, which can be performed under local anesthesia; standard cardiopulmonary bypass is usually instituted by transthoracic cannulation under general anesthesia\n\n\n\n\nUnlike standard cardiopulmonary bypass, which is used for short-term support measured in hours, ECMO is used for longer-term support ranging from 3-10 days\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of ECMO is to allow time for intrinsic recovery of the lungs and heart; a standard cardiopulmonary bypass provides support during various types of cardiac surgical procedures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA diagram of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nHistory of ECMO\nIn May 1953, Gibbon used artificial oxygenation and perfusion support for the first successful open heart operation.\n [2] In 1954, Lillehei developed the cross-circulation technique by using slightly anesthetized adult volunteers as live cardiopulmonary bypass apparatuses during the repair of certain congenital cardiac disorders.\n [3] In 1955, at the Mayo Clinic, Kirklin et al improved on Gibbon's device and successfully repaired an atrial septal defect.\n [4] \n\nIn 1965, Rashkind and coworkers were the first to use a bubble oxygenator as support in a neonate dying of respiratory failure.\n [5] In 1969, Dorson and colleagues reported the use of a membrane oxygenator for cardiopulmonary bypass in infants.\n [6] \n\nIn 1970, Baffes et al reported the successful use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as support in infants with congenital heart defects who were undergoing cardiac surgery.\n [7] In 1975, Bartlett et al were the first to successfully use ECMO in neonates with severe respiratory distress.\n [8] \n\nIndications for ECMO\nPatients with the following 2 major neonatal diagnoses require the use of ECMO:\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary diagnoses associated with primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), including idiopathic PPHN, meconium aspiration syndrome,\n [9] respiratory distress syndrome, group B streptococcal sepsis, and asphyxia\n\n\n\n\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)\n\n\n\nSelection criteria for neonates include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nGestational age of 34 weeks or more\n\n\n\n\nBirth weight of 2000 g or higher\n\n\n\n\nNo significant coagulopathy or uncontrolled bleeding\n\n\n\n\nNo major intracranial hemorrhage (grade 1 intracranial hemorrhage)\n\n\n\n\nMechanical ventilation for 10-14 days or less\n\n\n\n\nReversible lung injury\n\n\n\n\nNo lethal malformations\n\n\n\n\nNo major untreatable cardiac malformation\n\n\n\n\nFailure of maximal medical therapy\n\n\n\nFailure to meet these criteria is a relative contraindication for ECMO.\n\nQualifying patient criteria for ECMO are applied only when the infant has reached maximal ventilatory support of 100% oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] equals 1) with peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) often as high as 35 cm water. They include the alveolar-arterial gradient, the oxygenation index, and acute deterioration.\n\nThe alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient of 600-624 mm Hg for 4-12 hours at sea level may be computed as follows (where 47=partial pressure of water vapor):\n\n\n\n\n\n(A-a)(Diffusing capacity [D] of O2 equals atmospheric pressure - 47 - (PaCO2 + PaO2])/FiO2\n\n\n\nThe oxygenation index (OI) greater than 40 in 3 of 5 postductal gas determinations obtained 30-60 minutes apart may be computed as follows (where MAP is mean airway pressure):\n\n\n\n\n\nOI = (MAP x FiO2 x 100)/PaO2\n\n\n\n\nPaO2 = 35-50 mm Hg for 2-12 hours\n\n\n\nAcute deterioration may be computed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nPaO2 of 30-40 mm Hg or less for 2 hours\n\n\n\n\npH of 7.25 or less for 2 hours\n\n\n\n\nIntractable hypotension\n\n\n\nPediatric ECMO is indicated or considered in the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\nLow cardiac output resulting from right, left, and biventricular failure following repair of congenital heart defect\n\n\n\n\nPulmonary vasoreactive crisis following repair of congenital heart defect leading to severe hypoxemia, low cardiac output, or both\n\n\n\n\nRarely, as a bridge to cardiac surgery in patients with serious end-organ damage resulting from profound low cardiac output related to congenital heart disease\n\n\n\n\nAs a bridge to cardiac transplant\n\n\n\n\nPossibly, as a bridge to recovery in temporary cardiomyopathy secondary to renal failure, myocarditis, and burns.\n\n\n\nToday, other indications or less strict selection of patients in certain institutions have made the use of this technology more diverse, not only in acute cardiac problems but also in primary pulmonary diseases.\n [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] \n\nContraindications to ECMO\nThe failure to meet selection criteria discussed in Indications for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, above, is a relative contraindication for ECMO.\n\nUnlike the situation in neonates, when ECMO is considered in a pediatric patient, no clear set of inclusion or exclusion criteria exists.

        "Pediatric Pacemaker Implantation": "\nBackground\n\n\nPacemaker therapy in children involves unique issues regarding patient size, growth, development, and the possible presence of congenital heart disease; accordingly, this topic reviews aspects of pediatric pacemaker implantation and follow-up, with particular attention to the difficulties encountered with smaller children and patients with coexistent congenital heart defects.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \nTransvenous pacemaker implantation in young patients was previously limited by generator size and lead diameter in comparison to vascular dimensions and capacitance. Historically, epicardial pacing was more common in children. As technology has improved, generators and leads have become smaller and more advanced, allowing transvenous pacing systems in children; pacemaker therapy is now possible in neonates.\n\n\nPediatric pacemaker implantation is performed primarily to treat abnormalities of sinoatrial (SA) node (ie, sinus node) or atrioventricular (AV) node function that lead to an insufficient heart rate. In addition, pacemakers are used (although less commonly) for other disorders, such as congenital long QT syndrome and cardiomyopathy. A specialized type of pacemaker therapy known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is used adjunctively in pediatric patients with heart failure.\n [6, 7]  In addition, although relatively rare and decreasing in incidence, acute permanent pacemaker implantation after heart transplanation in children can occur and is associated with biatrial anastomosis, antiarrhythmic use, and older donor age; there is also an increased risk for posttransplant infection and dialysis but survival does not appear to be adversely affected by permanent pacemaker implantation.\n [8] \nChronotropic incompetence is the term used to describe the inability of the SA node to increase heart rate adequately as needed for the degree of activity. Sinus node dysfunction is a related term that describes an inappropriately low heart rate (either sinus or nonsinus) due to abnormal activity of the normal SA node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal cardiac conduction system is illustrated. AV = atrioventricular, IVC = inferior vena cava, SA = sinoatrial, SVC = superior vena cava.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAV blocks occur in three degrees of severity, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          First degree: The impulse is conducted through the AV node, albeit delayed.\n         \n\n\n\n          Second degree: Not all impulses are conducted through the AV node.\n         \n\n\n\n          Third degree: AV block is complete, and none of the impulses are conducted across the AV node.\n         \n\n\nCauses of SA or AV node dysfunction can be divided into two distinct categories: congenital and acquired. Congenital causes include congenital AV block and congenital SA node dysfunction, which is notably less common. Congenital heart block is often due to autoantibody production from maternal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n [9] Also, congenital heart block may be associated with congenital heart disease, such as L-transposition of the great arteries.\n\nAcquired forms of heart block or SA node dysfunction are caused by infection or injury, whereas other forms are idiopathic. Infections include viral myocarditis and Lyme disease. Surgical repair of congenital heart disease is the predominant cause of nodal or conduction tissue injury.\n\nPermanent pacing in children is a successful procedure that results in physiologic heart rates. Pacing also allows the pediatric patient to return to normal activity and lifestyle. The prognosis is excellent, because modern generation pacing systems allow physiologic atrial-synchronous, rate-responsive pacing in the vast majority of patients, even small infants and children with congenital heart disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Percutaneous Closure of Patent Foramen Ovale and Atrial Septal Defect": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nPercutaneous closure is a surgical procedure used to treat patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal defect (ASD). Advancements in device technology and image guidance now permit the safe and effective catheter-based closure of numerous intracardiac defects, including PFO and ASD.\n [1, 2] With these catheter-based closure procedures becoming more prevalent in adults, it is imperative that clinicians possess a sound understanding of intracardiac shunt lesions and indications for repair or closure.\n\n\nThe anatomy of PFO and ASD are shown in the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of atrial septal defect.

This figure shows the connection between the left and right atrial when a patent foramen ovale exists, and the location of such a defect. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Considerations\nStudies on annual recurrences after a cerebral vascular accident or a transient ischemic attack reported an incidence ranging from 3% to 16%.\n [3, 4] In a large study, the recurrent stroke rate or mortality from an embolic event was 6% to 8% per year.\n [5] A pooled analysis suggests that the presence of a PFO alone increased the risk for recurrent events 5-fold, with an even higher risk in the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm.\n [6] \n\nOther studies have found no significant influence of an isolated PFO but show a strong influence by a PFO associated with an atrial septal aneurysm. In a trial randomizing patients to acetylsalicylic acid or coumadin, the individual presence of a PFO or an atrial septal aneurysm had no influence on the incidence of recurrent stroke.\n [7] There are differing results on the question of whether a PFO with or without hypermobility of the septum leads to recurrent stroke are presumably related to factors (besides patient selection) such as diagnostic accuracy of the tests and definitions used to identify both the PFO and the atrial septal aneurysm.\n\nHomma et al\n [8] identified other risk factors for recurrent stroke, including the presence of a Eustachian valve directed toward the PFO, the gaping diameter of the PFO, and the number of microbubbles present in the left atrium during the first seconds after release of a Valsalva maneuver during a bubble test.\n\nOutcomes\nThe effectiveness of percutaneous closure compared with surgical closure or medical management in preventing recurrent embolic events is currently unknown. Uncontrolled studies evaluating percutaneous device closure of a PFO or, much less often, an ASD in patients with at least one paradoxical embolic event (ie, transient ischemic attack, stroke, or a peripheral embolism) have reported results similar to those reported for surgical closure.\n [9] A clinical trial is currently ongoing to determine whether percutaneous closure is more effective than medical management in preventing recurrent embolic events.\n\nNagpal et al studied 414 patients who underwent percutaneous closure between 2002-2009. They concluded that the long-term rate of recurrent stroke is low and serious long-term complications are rare, particularly in patients with a single neurological event.\n [10] \n\nSome studies have suggested that PFO closure may reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches in patients with significant right-to-left shunts. This data comes from single-center observational studies.\n [11] In a meta-analysis of 11 studies, Butera et al evaluated a total of 1,306 patients who underwent PFO closure, of whom 40% suffered from migraine. Quantitative synthesis showed complete cure of migraine in 46%, with resolution or significant improvement of migraine in 83% of cases. They concluded that a significant group of subjects with migraine headaches, particularly if treated after a neurological event, may benefit from percutaneous closure of their patent foramen ovale. However, no randomized, controlled studies are currently available to support this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)": "\nBackground\n\n\nSince the first human percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure was performed in 1977, the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased dramatically; it is now one of the most commonly performed medical interventions. Originally developed in Switzerland by Andreas Gruentzig, PCI has transformed the practice of revascularization for coronary artery disease (CAD).\n\nCoronary angioplasty, initially used in the treatment of patients with stable angina and discrete lesions in a single coronary artery, currently has multiple indications, including unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and multivessel CAD. With the combination of sophisticated equipment, experienced operators, and modern drug therapy, PCI has evolved into an effective nonsurgical modality for treating patients with CAD. Ongoing technical advances are allowing more patients with chronic total occlusions (CTOs) to be successfully treated percutaneously.\n\nImprovements in catheter technique and the development of new devices and medications have paralleled our growing understanding of cardiovascular physiology, the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the response to vascular injury. Intracoronary stents and atherectomy devices have been developed to increase the success and decrease the complications of conventional balloon dilation, as well as to expand the indications for revascularization. Interventionalists now can safely treat more complex coronary lesions and restenosis.\n\nThe development of drug-eluting stents (DESs) has substantially reduced the problem of restenosis seen with bare-metal stents (BMSs). At the same time, advances in intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fractional flow reserve (FFR) evaluation have improved the understanding of coronary plaque morphology, plaque vulnerability, and coronary physiology.\n\nFurthermore, many of these technologies are able to help identify patients who will benefit most from PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or medical therapy. Adjunctive pharmacologic therapies aimed at preventing acute reocclusion have also improved the safety and efficacy of PCI.\n\nThe growth of PCI has been remarkable. Stents are now used in more than 80% of PCI cases in the United States. This prominent use of stents will be sustained they result in improved outcomes. Over the past two decades, innovations in PCI have been paralleled by dramatic reductions in 30-day death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target-vessel revascularization rates.

During ventricular systole, the mitral valve closes and prevents backflow to the LA. The normal function of the mitral valve depends on its 6 components, which are (1) the left atrial wall, (2) the annulus, (3) the leaflets, (4) the chordae tendineae, (5) the papillary muscles, and (6) the left ventricular wall.

        "Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nPercutaneous mitral valve repair (MVR) is used to treat mitral regurgitation (see the image below). Percutaneous procedures used to treat valvular heart disease were first developed decades ago; the first pulmonic balloon valvuloplasty was reported in 1982, which was quickly followed by applications to the aortic and mitral valves.\n [1, 2] Mitral stenosis was the first pathologic condition of a heart valve to be treated both surgically\n [3] and percutaneously.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\nPercutaneous Mitral Valve Repair. Mitral regurgitation. \n\n\n\nOver the past 20 years, percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty used to treat mitral stenosis has yielded excellent success rates in patients with suitable valvular and subvalvular morphology.\n [5] However, clinically viable percutaneous treatments for mitral regurgitation have become available only relatively recently.\nNewer approaches have progressed far beyond balloon valvuloplasty to include catheter techniques for emulating surgical annuloplasty and edge-to-edge repair of regurgitant mitral valves.\n\n\n\n\nA multinational study by Nickenig et al of transcatheter MVR in 628 patients in Europe found that such treatment had a high acute procedural success rate (95.4%) and that reduction in the severity of mitral regurgitation persisted at 1 year.\n [6] The study also determined that the acute procedural success rate was similar between patients with functional mitral regurgitation and those with degenerative mitral regurgitation, as were the in-hospital (2.9%) and estimated 1-year mortality (15.3%). However, the patients with functional mitral regurgitation had a significantly higher estimated 1-year rate of heart failure-related rehospitalization than did the other group (25.8% versus 12.0%, respectively).\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nIn a study of the initial US commercial experience with transcatheter MVR using the MitraClip, Sorajja et al analyzed data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry on patients commercially treated with the MitraClip (N = 564).\n [7] Procedural success was achieved in 90.6% of patients, and the majority of patients were discharged home with a moderate or lesser degree of mitral regurgitation. The results support the effectiveness of MitraClip therapy in the treatment of appropriately selected, high-risk patients in a commercial setting.\n [7] \n\nIn a prospective, observational study, Scandura et al compared 1-year outcomes of MitraClip therapy in high surgical risk patients with moderate-to-severe or severe mitral regurgitation between patients aged up to 75 versus those 75 years or older (total N: 180 patients) and found that the primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 41 patients, with similar rates between groups.\n [8] The groups showed no significant differences in cumulative mortality or in the rates of rehospitalization for acute heart failure within 1 year after the MitraClip procedure. Relative to baseline, both groups showed a significant reduction in severity of mitral regurgitation achieved after the procedure at 1-year follow-up and a significant improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class.\n [8] \n\nThe COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial randomized 614 patients with heart failure with moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation and symptoms despite maximally tolerated medical therapy to transcatheter MVR (with MitraClip) plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. Transcatheter MVR was safe; provided a durable reduction in mitral regurgitation+, heart failure hospitalizations (51%) and mortality (33%); and improved quality of life and functional capacity compared with medical therapy alone through 36 months.\n [9] \n\nIn the near term, percutaneous valve intervention will probably have several indications, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nSevere disease deemed inoperable or at high risk of surgical complications owing to comorbid disease\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of secondary mitral regurgitation in patients with severe symptomatic heart failure refractory to medical therapy\n\n\n\n\nEarly-stage regurgitant lesions if less-invasive valve repair may prevent progressive ventricular enlargement\n\n\n\nVarious percutaneous approaches are being evaluated and used. The field will develop rapidly over the next several years, with refinement of the above approaches, emergence of still newer technologies, and better identification of which patients are most likely to derive benefit.\n\nIf these percutaneous techniques are to be considered as alternatives to traditional surgical methodologies in low-risk to medium-risk patients, they must demonstrate hemodynamic effects, safety, and durability comparable to those of the current highly refined surgical techniques. Conversely, these percutaneous techniques may be best applied to patients at the margins of current surgical indications.\n\nSee also Percutaneous Valve Therapies for more information.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe human heart has four valves.

        "Percutaneous Valve Therapies": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe field of percutaneous valve replacement and repair has developed at a rapid pace, particularly in the last decade, and percutaneous treatment of valvular heart disease is one of the fastest evolving areas of cardiology.\nClinical strategies to advance and refine percutaneous catheter-based approaches to cardiac valve repair and replacementwere initiated as early as the 1950s with the introduction of simple catheter devices for treating pulmonic stenosis. In the early 1980s, treatment of stenotic lesions matured with the advent of balloon valvuloplasty, which has become the predominant therapy for primary pulmonic and mitral stenosis lesions. Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty, however, has yielded largely unfavorable results and is performed usually as a bridge to definitive treatment because of its short-lived benefits.\n\n\nThere have been advances over the last decade involving the two most frequent forms of valvular heart disease in the industrialized West, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, which account for more than 70% of the cases of acquired valve disease in the United States and Europe. As the populations of the United States and other industrialized countries continue to age, the need for less invasive and safer methods of treating valvular disease will continue to grow. Careful evaluation comparing percutaneous approaches with conventional surgical approaches have extended the use of the new, less invasive techniques from high-risk patients to other, lower-risk patient groups.\n [1, 2] \nRationale for percutaneous approaches\nThe incidence of valvular heart disease is expected to increase over the next several decades. It is anticipated that treatment of heart disease—primarily valvular heart disease—will represent one of the main areas of focus for improving life expectancy and quality of life in an aging population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the increasing availability of cardiopulmonary bypass, surgical expertise, and intensive care facilities, valve repair and replacement are widely performed to relieve symptoms and improve prognosis of valvular heart disease, despite the associated morbidity and mortality. However, many patients with major comorbidities, particularly elderly patients, still do not undergo potentially beneficial interventions because of the high surgical risk.\n\nInvestigations into the current management of patients with valvular heart disease in Europe and the United States have shown that as many as one third of elderly patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and a similar number of patients with mitral regurgitation, were not referred for surgical management by the attending practitioner. The percentage of nonreferrals from the cardiologist’s office is likely to be even higher, and that from the general practitioner’s office may be higher still.\n\nA catheter-based alternative to surgery allows treatment of higher risk patients with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality, thus making treatment available to patients not currently considered surgical candidates. Moreover, patients show a strong preference for minimally invasive therapies in general, especially those who have undergone many operations.\n\nFinally, successful use of percutaneous approaches to valve replacement and repair could have a substantial positive economic impact by virtue of the associated reductions in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays.\n\nRealization of the potential benefits of percutaneous valve therapies continue to result in a paradigm shift, challenging long-standing traditional principles in the evaluation and treatment of valvular heart disease. Both short-term and long-term data are growing to assess percutaneous approaches compared with conventional surgical approaches with respect to superiority in safety and noninferiority in efficacy.\n\nPatient selection\nThe excellent results of contemporary surgical approaches to valvular heart disease have set a high standard for any new treatment strategies under consideration. However, patients who are considered candidates for less invasive procedures may present a different risk profile than those who are currently referred for surgery (at both the high end and the low end of the risk spectrum); therefore, comparisons with current surgical outcome standards are not always appropriate.\n\nThus, it is essential to keep in mind that patients referred for valvular interventions today tend to be elderly and to have an increased surgical risk associated with congestive heart failure, the emergency nature of the operation, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, coronary disease, previous operations, and (most important) severe comorbidities. Measures of invasiveness and effectiveness will also have to be weighed against the realities of patient expectations in potential patient candidate pools (those who currently may or may not be referred for surgery).\n\nAlthough significant challenges in patient selection and clinical trial design remain to be solved, the patient populations who ultimately benefit most from treatment with these new technologies have become better defined through a rigorous clinical trial process. New transcatheter approaches have changed the face of valve therapy and extend treatment to a larger proportion of the population with valve disease.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe normal human heart contains four valves that regulate blood flow into and out of the heart. The aortic and pulmonic valves are known as the semilunar valves, whereas the tricuspid and mitral valves are referred to as the atrioventricular valves. All the valves are trileaflet, with the exception of the mitral valve, which has two leaflets. All four cardiac valves are surrounded by fibrous tissue that form partial or complete valvular rings, or annuli. These annuli join the fibrous skeleton of the heart to anchor and support the valvular structures.\n\nThe aortic valve is located between the LV outflow tract (OT) and the ascending aorta. It forms the centerpiece of the heart and closely approximates many other important cardiac structures, specifically, the pulmonic valve anteriorly, mitral valve posterolaterally, and tricuspid valve posteromedially.\n\nThe mitral valve connects the left atrium (LA) and the LV. The mitral valve opens during diastole to allow the blood flow from the LA to the LV. During ventricular systole, the mitral valve closes and prevents backflow to the LA. The normal function of the mitral valve depends on its six components, which are (1) the LA wall, (2) the annulus, (3) the leaflets, (4) the chordae tendineae, (5) the papillary muscles, and (6) the LV wall (see Figure 1 below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercutaneous Valve Therapies. Note the components of the mitral valve apparatus. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe pulmonic valve divides the right ventricular (RV) OT from the pulmonary artery. In normal conditions, the pulmonic valve prevents regurgitation of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery back to the RV. It is a semilunar valve with three cusps, and it is located anterior, superior, and slightly to the left of the aortic valve.\n\nThe right atrioventricular valve complex (the tricuspid valve) is made up of the three valve leaflets, the annulus, the supporting chordae tendineae, and the papillary muscles. The atrial and ventricular masses, conduction system tissue, and support structure of the fibroelastic cardiac skeleton allow coordinated actions of the tricuspid valve.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Aortic Valve Anatomy, Mitral Valve Anatomy, Pulmonic Valve Anatomy, and Tricuspid Valve Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pericardial Window": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nPericardial window is used diagnostically and, more often, therapeutically for drainage of accumulated pericardial fluid (a condition that most often occurs after cardiac surgery but has many other possible causes). The pericardium envelops the heart like a cocoon; its cardiac filling can be impaired when this cavity fills with excess fluid. When the limited space between the noncompliant pericardium and heart is acutely filled with blood or fluid, cardiac compression and tamponade may result. Pericardial window in combination with systemic chemotherapy may also prevent accumulation of large fluid volumes in patients with neoplastic pericardial disease.\n [1, 2] \n\n\nPericardial window involves the excision of a portion of the pericardium, which allows the effusion to drain continuously into the peritoneum or chest.\n [3] The fluid can be drained in any of 3 ways: via a small subxiphoid incision, thoracoscopically,\n [4] or via a thoracotomy.\n [5] \nIndications\nThe following are indications for a pericardial window\n [6] :\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptomatic pericardial effusions\n\n\n\n\nAsymptomatic pericardial effusions that warrant a pericardial window for diagnosis\n\n\n\n\nHemodynamically stable patients with an undiagnosed pericardial effusion (a thoracoscopic approach is ideal)\n\n\n\n\nCoexisting pericardial, pleural, or pulmonary pathology that requires diagnosis or therapy (a thoracoscopic approach is ideal)\n\n\n\n\nKnown benign effusions that reaccumulate after aspiration\n\n\n\n\nDrainage of a purulent pericardial effusion\n\n\n\n\nEarly fungal or tuberculous pericarditis in which resection of the pericardium is required to prevent future pericardial constriction\n\n\n\n\nUse as part of the mediastinal debridement, in patients with descending mediastinitis\n\n\n\n\nLoculated effusions situated unilaterally or posteriorly (more easily approached thoracoscopically)\n\n\n\n\nChylopericardium (thoracoscopic window and ligation of the thoracic duct)\n\n\n\n\nDelayed hemopericardium or effusions after cardiac surgery (usually treated via a subxiphoid approach, but a thoracoscopic approach is also used)\n\n\n\n\nAn effusion in a patient with a substernal gastric or colonic conduit in whom a subxiphoid approach is not possible (an unusual indication for a thoracoscopic pericardial window)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThe following is a contraindication for a pericardial window\n [6] :\n\n\n\n\n\nConcomitant cardiac surgery necessitating a sternotomy for which a full pericardiotomy would be performed\n\n\n\nTechnical Considerations\nThe following technical points may improve the performance of pericardial window procedures:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the patient is unstable, employ the subxiphoid approach\n\n\n\n\nUse the Allis clamp to grasp the pericardium\n\n\n\n\nResect an adequate area of pericardium\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that no undrained areas of the pericardial space remain by using a sucker to explore all areas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pericardiocentesis": "\nOverview\n\n\nPericardiocentesis is the aspiration of fluid from the pericardial space that surrounds the heart. This procedure can be life saving in patients with cardiac tamponade, even when it complicates acute type A aortic dissection and when cardiothoracic surgery is not available.\n [1] \nCardiac tamponade is a time sensitive, life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and management. Historically, the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade has been based on clinical findings. Claude Beck, a cardiovascular surgeon, described two triads of clinical findings that he found associated with acute and chronic cardiac tamponade. The first of these triads consisted of hypotension, an increased venous pressure, and a quiet heart. It has come to be recognized as Beck's triad, a collection of findings most commonly produced by acute intrapericardial hemorrhage. Subsequent studies have shown that these classic findings are observed in only a minority of patients with cardiac tamponade.\n [2] \n\n\nThe detection of pericardial fluid has been facilitated by the development and continued improvement of echocardiography.\n [3] Cardiac ultrasonography is now accepted as the criterion standard imaging modality for the assessment of pericardial effusions and the dynamic findings consistent with cardiac tamponade. With echocardiography, the location of the effusion can be identified, the size can be estimated (small, medium, or large), and the hemodynamic effects can be examined by assessing for abnormal septal motion, right atrial or right ventricular inversion, and decreased respiratory variation of the diameter of the inferior vena cava.\n [4] \nMoreover, a 2017 retrospective study (2007-2012) of 18 nontrauma patients diagnosed with large pericardial effusions or tamponade in an emergency department suggests that point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) may be effective in identifying pericardial effusions and guiding appropriate treatment, with a resultant decreased time to pericardiocentesis and decreased length of hospital stay.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nSubxiphoid views of pericardial effusion are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPericardiocentesis.

Although a retrospective study has reported success and no complications with a novel pericardiocentesis technique that uses an in-plane parasternal medial-to-lateral approach with the use of a high-frequency probe in 11 patients with cardiac tamponade, larger studies and further investigation are needed.\n [6] \n\nHistorical background\nPercutaneous pericardiocentesis was introduced during the 19th century. Frank Schuh first described this procedure in 1840. By the 20th century, percutaneous pericardiocentesis became a preferred technique for the treatment of patients with pericardial effusion or for diagnostic purposes.\n\nBefore the advent of 2-dimensional echocardiography, the procedure used a blind-subxiphoid approach. Serious complications were not uncommon (eg, injury to liver, myocardium, coronary arteries, lungs). Because 2-dimensional echocardiography permits direct visualization of cardiac structures and adjacent vital organs, the procedure now is performed with minimal risk. Since 1979, echo-guided pericardiocentesis has been the preferred initial procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of most pericardial effusions. The technique has been modified and refined in the past 22 years. Percutaneous pericardiocentesis now is the procedure of choice for the safe removal of pericardial fluid. Whenever possible, this procedure should be performed by a surgeon, an interventional cardiologist or a cardiologist trained in invasive techniques.\n\nThere is no significant difference in overall mortality between open surgical drainage and percutaneous pericardiocentesis for symptomatic pericardial effusions. There may be more procedural complications following surgical drainage of a pericardial effusion, and the need for repeat procedures may be greater if the effusion is drained using pericardiocentesis.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Permanent Pacemaker Insertion": "\nBackground\n\n\nPermanent pacemaker insertion plays a key role in the management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure.\n [1] The number of permanent pacemaker insertions in the United States has been steadily increasing.\n [2] A pacemaker is an electronic device, approximately the size of a pocket watch, that senses intrinsic heart rhythms and provides electrical stimulation when indicated.\nAt present, three approaches to permanent cardiac pacing are in common use:\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-chamber pacemaker – With this device, one pacing lead is implanted in the right atrium or ventricle\n\n\n\n\nDual-chamber pacemaker – With this device, two pacing leads are implanted (one in the right ventricle and one in the right atrium); this is the most common type of implanted pacemaker\n\n\n\n\nBiventricular pacing (cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]) – With this approach, in addition to single- or dual-chamber right heart pacing leads, a lead is advanced to the coronary sinus for left ventricular epicardial pacing\n\n\n\n\nThe first implantable pacemaker to be used in a human being was inserted by Dr. Ake Senning in 1958; it lasted for only a few hours. Since then, cardiac pacing has evolved to include single-chamber, dual-chamber, and CRT devices. Epicardial lead implantation by thoracotomy has largely been replaced by transvenous placement of right atrial and right ventricular leads, as well as left ventricular epicardial pacing lead placement via the coronary sinus.\n\n\n\n\nRemarkable advances have been made in pacemaker technology, including reduced size, increased battery longevity, and remote monitoring capability, as well as the addition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-safe pacemakers.\n [3] \nPublished guidelines that outline indications for cardiac pacing are available from both the American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology.\n [4, 5] This article outlines the clinical indications for pacing, implant techniques, and common pacing system complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pharmacologic Stress Testing": "\nBackground\n\n\nExercise testing is a cardiovascular stress test using treadmill bicycle exercise with ECG and blood pressure monitoring. Pharmacologic stress testing, established after exercise testing, is a diagnostic procedure in which cardiovascular stress induced by pharmacologic agents is demonstrated in patients with decreased functional capacity or in patients who cannot exercise.\n [1] Pharmacologic stress testing is used in combination with imaging modalities such as radionuclide imaging and echocardiography.\nRadionuclide uptake and ECG images are depicted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal radionuclide uptake (dipyridamole-Cardiolite). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECGs show a normal sinus rhythm and a sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECG depicts electrophysiologic events of left bundle branch block. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdenosine, dipyridamole (Persantine), and dobutamine are the most widely available pharmacologic agents for stress testing. Regadenoson, an adenosine analog, has a longer half-life than adenosine, and therefore a bolus versus continuous administration.\n\nAdenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenosine are cardiac vasodilators. They dilate coronary vessels, which causes increased blood velocity and flow rate in normal vessels and less of a response in stenotic vessels. This difference in response leads to a steal of flow, and perfusion defects appear in cardiac nuclear scans or as ST-segment changes.\n\nDobutamine is a cardiac inotrope and chronotrope. The heart responds to dobutamine similarly to the way it responds to exercise.\n\nAdenosine\nAdenosine is a naturally occurring substance found throughout the body in various tissues. It functions to regulate blood flow in many vascular beds, including the myocardium. The mechanisms by which adenosine is produced intracellularly are the S -adenosyl homocysteine and the adenosine triphosphate pathways; the latter plays a role during ischemia.\n\nOnce transported across cell membranes, adenosine interacts and activates the A1 and A2 cell surface receptors. In the vascular smooth muscles, adenosine primarily acts by activation of the A2 receptor, which stimulates adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Increased cAMP levels inhibit calcium uptake by the sarcolemma, causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Activation of the vascular A1 receptor also occurs, which stimulates guanylate cyclase, inducing cyclic guanosine monophosphate production, leading to vasodilation.\n\nThis direct coronary artery vasodilation induced by adenosine is attenuated in diseased coronary arteries, which have a reduced coronary flow reserve and cannot further dilate in response to adenosine. This is not the case in healthy or less-diseased coronary arteries in the same patient, which produces relative flow heterogeneity throughout the coronary arteries, resulting in relatively more coronary blood flow in the healthy or less-diseased coronary arteries compared with the more-diseased coronary artery. In most cases, coronary blood flow in the diseased coronary arteries does not decrease.\n\nIn cases of severe vessel stenosis or total occlusions with compensatory collateral circulation, a decrease in coronary blood flow may occur in the diseased coronary artery, thus inducing ischemia via a coronary steal phenomenon. This regional flow abnormality also induces a perfusion defect during radionuclide imaging.\n\nDipyridamole (Persantine)\nDipyridamole is an indirect coronary vasodilator that works by increasing intravascular adenosine levels. This occurs by the inhibition of intracellular reuptake and deamination of adenosine. However, the increase in coronary blood flow induced by dipyridamole is less predictable than that of adenosine.\n\nIn one comparative study of dipyridamole and adenosine, 66% of patients (10 of 15) receiving dipyridamole versus 80% of patients (12 of 15) receiving adenosine had a maximal hyperemic response. However, this difference may not be apparent clinically. The mechanism of inducing a perfusion abnormality is similar to that of adenosine (see adenosine discussion above) except true coronary steal occurs more frequently.\n\nDobutamine\nDobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine, which directly stimulates both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. A dose-related increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility occurs.\n\nAs with physical exertion, dobutamine increases regional myocardial blood flow based on physiological principles of coronary flow reserve. A similar dose-related increase in subepicardial and subendocardial blood flow occurs within vascular beds supplied by significantly stenosed arteries, with most of the increase occurring within the subepicardium rather than the subendocardium. Thus, perfusion abnormalities are induced by the development of regional myocardial ischemia.\n\nHyperemic impedance echocardiography (HIE) may have the potential to detect inducible myocardial ischemia for patients in whom exercise or pharmacologic stress testing is contraindicated or not tolerated. In a pilot study involving 20 consecutive outpatients with suspected stable coronary artery disease who underwent clinically indicated dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and then HIE, HIE was 86% sensitive and 67% specific in identifying inducible myocardial ischemia as evaluated by regional wall motion abnormalities, as well as 83% sensitive for detecting significant CAD (≥50% diameter stenosis) on coronary angiography.\n [2] \n\nRegadenoson (Lexiscan)\nRegadenoson is a pharmacologic stress agent approved by the FDA in 2008 as an additional agent for use in stress testing for patients unable to perform the standard exercise stress test.\n [3, 4] \n\nRegadenoson produces maximal hyperemia quickly and maintains it for an optimal duration that is practical for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Regadenoson's simple rapid bolus administration and short duration of hyperemic effect point to an advantage of enhanced control for the clinician.\n\nRegadenoson is an agonist with low affinity (Ki ≈ 1.3 μM) for the A2A adenosine receptor, and at least a 10-fold lower affinity for the A1 adenosine receptor (Ki > 16.5 μM). In addition, it has relatively weak affinity for the A2B and A3 adenosine receptors.\n\nCoronary vasodilation and an increase in coronary blood flow (CBF) results from activation of the A2A adenosine receptor by regadenoson.\n\nEnoximone stress echocardiography\nDobutamine stress echocardiography is frequently used to assess myocardial viability; however, the inotropic response to adrenergic stimulation may be reduced in patients receiving a beta-blocker. In addition, dobutamine may sometimes induce ischemia in patients with a critical coronary stenosis, which might mask hibernation by preventing the improvement in wall motion.\n\nAnother approach is the use of an imidazole phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as enoximone or milrinone, drugs that are relatively unaffected by concurrent use of a beta-blocker and are used for inotropic support in congestive heart failure.\n\nEnoximone stress echocardiography as an additional stress testing modality was evaluated in one study of 45 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction who underwent echocardiography with both dobutamine and enoximone.\n\nBoth increased heart rate, but enoximone did not cause a significant change in systolic blood pressure. The positive predictive value and specificity were similar between enoximone and dobutamine. Concordant results were seen in 85% of affected segments, but enoximone had a higher sensitivity (88% vs 79% for dobutamine) and negative predictive value (90% vs 84%) in predicting functional recovery after revascularization.\n\nAt this time, enoximone is not approved for use in the United States; however, the pharmacology of milrinone is very similar, and this agent could be considered for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in selected patients on beta-blockers. Further investigations will be required to validate this approach.\n\nArm exercise as a potential alternative to pharmacologic stress testing\nArm exercise may have the potential to be an effective and low-cost alternative to pharmacologic stress testing.\n [5] In a 6-year study (1997-2002) with 12 years of follow-up in 446 veterans aged 64 years with lower-extremity disabilities, Martin et al used ergometer stress tests to evaluate exercise variables in predicting long-term all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. None of the exercise variables predicted myocardial infarction, but factors predictive of 12-year all-cause death included arm exercise capacity, heart rate recovery, and delta heart rate, whereas factors predictive of coronary revascularization included stress-induced ST-segment deviations, limiting angina, and an abnormal perfusion imaging finding.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Sternotomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nMedian sternotomy is one of many incisions that can be made in the thorax and gives a wide view of the thoracic cavity. Other incisions which involve the sternum, providing access to the thoracic cavity include the hemisternotomy (upper or lower), bilateral thoracosternotomy (clamshell), thoracosternotomy (hemiclamshell) and modified thoracosternotomy.\n [1, 2, 3] \n\n\nIndications\nAlthough the median sternotomy is predominantly associated with cardiac surgery, it is a useful incision for a number of other operations. The incision also allows access to both pleural spaces, making it useful for some thoracic operations, retrosternal goiter access and esophagectomy.\n [1] The incision for many neurosurgical procedures that require access to thoracic vertebral bodies or discs for treatment of fracture, neoplasm, bone cysts, osteomyelitis, spinal medullary tumors, discitis, or herniated nucleus pulposus.\n [4, 5] \n\n\n\n\nAn upper hemisternotomy is used for minimally invasive aortic and mitral valve surgery, while a lower hemisternotomy can be useful to access the right internal mammary artery and mid or right distal coronary artery for coronary artery bypass grafting.\n [2, 6, 7, 8, 9] \n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nAlthough not an absolute contraindication, previous surgery using the median sternotomy is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. In some cases, an alternative surgical approach should be considered, such as a left lateral thoracotomy or a mini thoracotomy. Other relative contraindications include obesity, COPD, radiation therapy to the chest, and cardiomegaly.\n [1] \n\nIndications for emergency repeat sternotomy\nIn cardiac surgery, a 5% risk exists of bleeding or tamponade following a first cardiac operation. If the patient is having, or at risk of having, a cardiac arrest secondary to these complications, an emergency repeat sternotomy should be performed. Emergency re-exploration is required for excessive mediastinal bleeding, defined as being approximately more than 500 mL over 30 minutes, more than 7 mL/kg for an hour, more than 5 mL/kg for 2 hours, more than 3mL/kg for 3 hours, or more than 2 mL/kg for 5 hours.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Synchronized Electrical Cardioversion": "\nOverview\n\n\nDelivery of direct current (DC) shocks to the heart has long been used successfully to convert abnormal heart rhythms back to normal sinus rhythm. In 1775, Abildgaard reported using electricity to both induce and revive a hen from lifelessness.\n [1] Beck was the first physician to use DC defibrillation on a human to treat ventricular fibrillation (VF, vfib) in a 14-year-old during cardiac surgery in 1947. Fifteen years later, Lown applied synchronized DC shocks to the heart to convert atrial fibrillation (AF, afib) and ventricular tachycardia (VT, vtach) to normal sinus rhythm.\n [2] \nCardioversion is defined as a “synchronized DC discharge, and … does not apply to ventricular defibrillation or to the pharmacologic reversion of arrhythmias.”\n [3, 4]  It is typically used to terminate life-threatening or unstable tachycardic arrhythmia (unstable ventricular and supraventricular rhythms) in patients who still have a pulse but who are hemodynamically unstable.\n [5] The DC electrical discharge is synchronized with the R or S wave of the QRS complex. Synchronization in the early part of the QRS complex avoids energy delivery near the apex of the T wave in the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), which coincides with a vulnerable period for induction of ventricular fibrillation. The peak of the T wave represents the terminal portion of the refractory state when adjacent heart fibers are in differing states of repolarization.\n\n\nDefibrillation refers to an unsynchronized discharge of energy and is only recommended for ventricular fibrillation. It is used in patients who are in cardiac arrest.\n [5] \nBasic principles\nTransient delivery of an electrical current causes a momentary depolarization of most cardiac cells, thereby allowing the sinus node to resume normal pacemaker activity. In the presence of a reentrant-induced arrhythmia, such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and ventricular tachycardia (VT), electrical cardioversion interrupts the self-perpetuating circuit and restores a sinus rhythm. Electrical cardioversion is much less effective in treating arrhythmia caused by increased automaticity (eg, digitalis-induced tachycardia, catecholamine-induced arrhythmia) because the mechanism of the arrhythmia remains after the arrhythmia is terminated and therefore is likely to recur.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt present, two types of defibrillators are in use for external cardioversion and defibrillation: a monophasic sinusoidal waveform (positive sine wave) and a biphasic truncated waveform. In 1997, a low-energy, impedance-compensating biphasic waveform was evaluated for atrial and ventricular arrhythmia management. This defibrillator automatically adjusted to the patient's transthoracic impedance, which is a feature that the monophasic models lack. Currently, there are several biphasic devices with similar efficacy available on the market.\n\nThe more recent use of biphasic cardioversion has shown that less energy is required to convert an arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm than with monophasic cardioversion. Consequently, use of biphasic energy results in fewer delivered shocks to the patient and less cumulative energy delivered. Potential benefits include fewer burn wounds, less tissue damage, and reduced damage to the heart muscle than is found with higher voltage shocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Typically, these techniques are used to gather information about the cardiac conduction system, which can then be used to guide the treatment of heart rhythm disorders.\n [1] As an example of its utility, these techniques demonstrated that most ventricular tachycardia in the setting of ischemic heart disease is reentrant rather than automatic.\n [2] These observations have led to the development of anti-tachycardia pacing as a painless alternative to high-energy implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks and have been instrumental in guiding the ablative therapy of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias.\n [3] \nProgrammed stimulation, which is a means of entrainment, is most commonly used during invasive electrophysiologic studies, although it may also be accomplished to some degree through an existing pacemaker or implanted defibrillator.

        "Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR)": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn 1994, Dake et al first reported the use of thoracic \"stent-grafts\" for the treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) in patients who were believed to be at excessive risk with conventional open surgery.\n [1]  They showed that placement of thoracic stent grafts, otherwise known as thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), could be performed from a technical standpoint with relatively low morbidity; however, they noted that long-term follow-up would be required. The initial stent grafts were actually constructed by the implanting physicians themselves; later, the devices were restricted to those under investigational study.\nIn 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first commercially available thoracic stent graft, the W. L. Gore TAG endograft system (Flagstaff, AZ); in 2008, the FDA approved the Cook Zenith TX2 (Bloomington, IN)\n [2]  and the Medtronic Talent (Santa Rosa, CA) thoracic endograft systems. All three of these devices were approved for use in the treatment of TAAs.\n\n\nThe randomized clinical trial that led to the approval of the TAG device demonstrated that in patients with appropriate anatomy, TEVAR could be performed with lower operative mortality than open surgical repair (2.1% vs 11.7%) and with less spinal cord ischemia (3% vs 14%), respiratory insufficiency (4% vs 20%), and renal failure (1% vs 13%).\n [3]  However, TEVAR yielded more vascular access–related complications. Importantly, a small percentage of patients who were undergoing TEVAR did not have their aneurysms entirely excluded from the aortic circulation at 1- and 2-year follow-up. As in the 1994 study by Dake et al, the authors maintained that all patients undergoing TEVAR required close long-term follow-up.\nDake et al and investigators in Europe later showed that TEVAR was technically feasible in patients with descending thoracic aortic dissections (patients with tears in the wall of their aortas).\n [4]  Nonetheless, ongoing studies are still trying to identify which patients with thoracic aortic dissection can benefit from TEVAR. Patients with complicated dissections, including those involving malperfusion (where a blood supply is impeded by flaps of aortic tissue caused by the dissection), appear to benefit from TEVAR to seal the site of dissection and reappose aortic wall layers.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that historically, open surgical approaches in patients with dissection-related malperfusion have had a high mortality.\n [5] Accordingly, a US clinical trial examined TEVAR for patients with complicated dissection (STABLE trial, Cook Inc, Bloomington, IN). This multicenter study included patients with complicated type B aortic dissection (cTBAD) who were treated with an endovascular system consisting of proximal TX2 thoracic stent grafts and distal bare-metal dissection stents (Zenith Dissection Endovascular System; Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN). Indications for enrollment included the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Branch-vessel malperfusion\n         \n\n\n\n          Impending rupture\n         \n\n\n\n          Aortic diameter ≥40 mm\n         \n\n\n\n          Rapid aortic expansion\n         \n\n\n\n          Persistent pain or hypertension despite maximum medical therapy\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this trial, the 30-day mortality was 5% (2/40); two more deaths occurred after 30 days, leading to a 1-year survival rate of 90%. The investigators noted aortic remodeling with a decrease in false lumen diameter and an increase in true lumen diameter, with complete thrombosis of the false lumen in 31% at 1 year.\n\nIt would seem logical that TEVAR could also be used in patients with uncomplicated dissections. To address this question, a prospective randomized clinical trial was completed in Europe, the INSTEAD XL trial (INvestigation of STEnt grafts in patients with type B Aortic Dissection).\n [6] Initially, at 1 year, this trial did not show a mortality benefit\n [6] ; however, 5-year follow-up revealed an aorta-specific survival benefit in patients treated with TEVAR vs medical therapy (6.9% vs 19.3% risk of aorta-specific mortality), as well as less disease progression risk (27.0% vs 46.1%).\n [7] \n\nSince the 2005 FDA approval of the TAG device for thoracic aneurysms, the use of endovascular stent grafts for thoracic aortic disease has increased dramatically. Surgeons have subsequently devised novel techniques to facilitate the use of TEVAR in higher-risk patients with more complex anatomy. Branch vessels that would have been occluded by the stent grafts can often be bypassed, and the landing zone can be moved more proximally to allow an adequate seal.\n [5, 8, 9]  \n\nAdditionally, trials are currently under way that are aimed at addressing thoracic aortic pathology encroaching on or involving the arch branch vessels, such as the Gore Thoracic Branch Endoprosthesis (Gore TBE) trial (see the first image below), the Medtronic MonaLSA trial (see the second image below), and the Bolton Dual Arch branch graft trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGore Thoracic Branch Endoprosthesis (Gore TBE).

Freedom from all-cause mortality by life-table analysis over the whole follow-up period was 56% in the TAA group, 64% in the CTBAD group, and 42% in the ATBAD group.

        "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)": "\nBackground\n\n\nSevere symptomatic aortic stenosis carries a poor prognosis. Until relatively recently, surgical aortic valve replacement has been the standard of care in adults with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, the risks associated with surgical aortic valve replacement are increased in elderly patients and those with concomitant severe systolic heart failure or coronary artery disease, as well as in patients with comorbidities such as cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic respiratory dysfunction.\nTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was developed as an alternative to the surgical approach in this high-risk and inoperable population. TAVR is a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure to replace the function of the aortic valve. Indicated for patients at intermediate or greater risk for open heart surgery, TAVR may be an excellent option for certain patients because the prevalence of aortic stenosis and comorbidities may increase the risks associated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The entire procedure typically takes approximately 1-2 hours. A heart team comprising cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, and other aortic stenosis experts may determine what the best procedure is as well as take into account other considerations such as whether the patient should receive a mild sedative or general anesthesia.\n\n\nAt the start of the procedure, surgeons make a small incision in one of three places, the groin, the neck, or an intercostal space. A thin, flexible catheter with the heart valve is guided through the incision into the artery and to the diseased valve. The TAVR heart valve is placed in the diseased or failing surgical valve; it begins working immediately. The catheter is then removed and the incision closed.\nCurrently available devices in the United States include the self-expandable Evolut R and Evolut PRO valves, the balloon-expandable Sapien3 and Sapien 3 Ultra valves, and the mechanically-expandable Lotus Edge valve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Transcutaneous Cardiac Pacing": "\nBackground\n\n\nTemporary cardiac pacing can be implemented via the insertion or application of intracardiac, intraesophageal, or transcutaneous leads; this topic focuses on transcutaneous cardiac pacing. Newer techniques (eg, using transcutaneous ultrasound to stimulate the heart) are under investigation.\n [1] The goal in temporary cardiac pacing is to improve cardiac hemodynamics until the underlying problem resolves or a permanent pacing strategy is applied. Transcutaneous cardiac pacing allows fast, efficient, and noninvasive ventricular stimulation in conscious patients to treat symptomatic bradycardias, including atropine-resistant unstable bradycardia in the emergency department.\n [2] \nExternal defibrillators usually have a pacing capability, and, when an external pacemaker or a defibrillator is used, the pacing stimulus can be induced via two large transcutaneous patches; both patches may be applied to the chest, or one patch may be applied to the chest and the other to the back. The video below demonstrates transcutaneous cardiac pacing using a defibrillator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscutaneous Cardiac Pacing.

However, perhaps because of associated diaphragmatic and skeletal muscle contractions, transcutaneous pacing can provide greater cardiac output than endocardial ventricular pacing does.\n [4, 5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Transradial Cardiac Catheterization": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn the hands of experienced operators and high-volume transradial catheterization centers, transradial coronary angiography and intervention offer improved patient comfort, decreased access-site complications, and decreased costs without compromising procedural success or long-term outcomes. Patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), in particular, benefit from a transradial approach to coronary intervention.\nAttaining proficiency in transradial catheterization and intervention, especially for a seasoned practitioner experienced in transfemoral procedures, requires time, effort, and humility. Despite this, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in the past decade in cardiologists willing to “make the leap” to transradial cardiac catheterization. Transradial access has become the default mode of catheterization for a growing number of cardiologists and will undoubtedly continue to be increasingly performed.\n\n\nHistorical background\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) today is not what it was two decades ago. The field of interventional cardiology has seen a dramatic increase in procedural success and declines in ischemic and bleeding complications, largely because of advances in antithrombotic therapies, evidence-based pharmacological strategies, and device technology.\n [1] With these successes, recent attention has turned to reducing complications associated with vascular access.\n [2] The search for a procedural approach to bleeding reduction, coupled with the goal of improving patient comfort, has led to a renewed interest in radial artery access, as opposed to the traditional femoral artery access, for coronary catheterization and intervention.\n\n\n\n\nApproaching the heart from the upper extremity is not a new concept. Indeed, the first human cardiac catheterization was performed via the brachial vein by Werner Forssman in 1929,\n [3] and the first transradial aortic cannulation was described in 1948.\n [4] Initial angioplasties in the 1970s involved large guide catheters, however, which required larger arterial access, so femoral cannulation became the primary mode of arterial access for coronary catheterization and intervention.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the first transradial angiography was reported by Campeau et al in 1989,\n [5] followed shortly thereafter by the first transradial coronary stenting by Kiemeneij and Laarman in 1993,\n [6] transradial coronary catheterization was relegated to “backup” access for patients without alternate arterial access.\n\nThe transfemoral approach has remained the primary route of arterial access for cardiac catheterization in the United States. As recently as 2008, only 1.3% of coronary interventions in the United States were performed via the transradial approach.\n [7] Transradial catheterization is currently much more frequently performed in Europe and Asia.\n [8, 9] However, transradial cardiac catheterization in the United States has seen growing use and enthusiasm over recent years, driven by improved patient comfort, decreased length of stay and hospital costs, and accumulating data showing clinical benefit, primarily in terms of decreased access-site complications. In the United States, the proportion of transradial PCI procedures increased from 1.2% in the first quarter of 2007 to 16.1% in the third quarter of 2012 and accounted for 6.3% of total procedures from 2007 to 2012 (n=178,643).\n [10] \n\nAdvantages of transradial cardiac catheterization and intervention\nThe primary advantage of transradial cardiac catheterization and intervention is reduced access-site complications.\n [7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] Because the radial artery is small and superficial, it is easily compressible, and bleeding complications associated with radial arterial access are extremely rare.\n\nFemoral arterial cannulation, contrarily, carries a significant risk of access-site bleeding complications. Hematomas and pseudoaneurysms at the site of arterial access are frequent and often painful complications of cardiac catheterization that are much less common with transradial access.\n [16] Retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening complication of femoral arterial catheterization. Certain patient populations, such as elderly and obese patients, are at an increased risk of bleeding complications from femoral arterial catheterization.\n\nUp to 80% of all major bleeding events associated with PCI may be access-site related, and both major and minor bleeding with PCI are significant predictors of mortality and morbidity.\n [17, 18, 19] \n\nPatient groups who derive an increased benefit from transradial cardiac catheterization include elderly persons,\n [20] those with acute coronary syndrome,\n [21] and those receiving IIb/IIIa inhibitors.\n [22] \n\nImproved patient comfort is also a significant advantage to transradial cardiac catheterization.\n [13, 14, 15] Even with vascular closure devices, transfemoral cardiac catheterization requires that the patient maintain a supine position for an extended period postprocedure in order to achieve hemostasis. This can be especially uncomfortable in patients with chronic back problems. Transradial catheterization obviates the need for postprocedural flat time, and most patients are able to ambulate immediately following the procedure. Patient preference is clearly in favor of transradial catheterization.\n\nIn the RIVAL trial, 90% of patients randomized to undergo the transradial approach reported preference for the same approach if a repeat procedure was needed, as opposed to 49% in the transfemoral arm.\n [23] Other studies have reported improved quality-of-life measures with transradial versus transfemoral cardiac catheterization.\n [24] \n\nTransradial catheterization also has the potential to reduce procedural costs.\n [13, 14, 15, 25, 26]  Fewer complications equate to shorter hospital stays.\n [13, 14, 15, 24] Additionally, less staffing is needed to care for patients following transradial catheterization. Furthermore, same-day discharge is feasible after coronary intervention, which shortens stays and significantly reduces costs.\n [27, 28] One study showed PCI with transradial access was associated with a cost savings exceeding $800 per patient relative to transfemoral access.\n [29] \n\nAnother advantage of transradial cardiac catherization is that a universal catheter can be used, which saves time, radiation exposure, and contrast.\n [15] \n\nDisadvantages of transradial cardiac catheterization and intervention\nTransradial cardiac catheterization and intervention has a steep learning curve.\n [30, 31] Negotiating the radial artery and aortic arch with guidewires and catheters from the transradial approach is more technically challenging than from the femoral approach. The radial and subclavian arteries are frequently tortuous and require operator proficiency at navigating such vessels.\n\nCatheter manipulation and engagement of coronary arteries from the transradial approach is also technically different than that from the femoral artery and requires a different skillset.\n [15] Studies have shown a significant decrease in procedural failure, access-site crossover, procedural time, and fluoroscopic time with increasing operator volume and experience.\n [23, 32] Jolly et al found that, among experienced transradial operators, the procedural success rate of the transradial approach compared with transfemoral approach did not differ, but, among inexperienced operators, the procedural failure rate was high.\n [11] A substudy of the RIVAL trial further evaluated the role of center and operator volume on clinical outcomes. The authors found a strong interaction between overall and transradial center volumes, and clinical outcomes, but not transfemoral center volumes.\n [33] \n\nOne study found that independent predictors of transradial failure among low-to-intermediate volume transradial operators included patient age older than 75 years, prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and short stature.\n [34] \n\nIncreased procedural time and increased radiation exposure are both a concern with transradial cardiac catheterization.\n [35] Several studies have shown longer procedural time and fluoroscopy time for transradial coronary angiography compared with transfemoral catheterization.\n [36, 37] The gap, however, significantly decreases with operator volume and experience.\n [35] For experienced operators, there is little difference in fluoroscopy time; indeed, procedural times are actually shorter with transradial catheterization.\n [26] Cumulative radiation exposure to the operator with either left or right radial artery approach is well under the annual dose-equivalent limit.\n [38]  Contrast volume is similar between transfemoral and transradial approaches.\n [35] \n\nRadial artery occlusion is a potential complication with transradial catheterization, although it is rarely a clinically significant event. Radial artery occlusion can potentially limit future radial access and limit the use of the radial artery for dialysis fistulas or as grafts for coronary artery bypass, so attempts should be made to avoid occlusion. Procedural techniques have been shown to significantly reduce radial artery occlusion.\n [39, 40, 41] \n\nHand ischemia following transradial angiography is extremely rare.\n [42, 43, 44] Of the estimated 650,000 transradial procedures performed annually around the world,\n [9]  fewer than a dozen incidents of hand ischemia has been reported.\n [45, 46, 47] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Transthoracic Needle Biopsy (TNB)": "\nOverview\n\n\nTransthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) is a safe rapid method used to achieve definitive diagnosis for most thoracic lesions,\n [1] whether the lesion is located in the pleura, the lung parenchyma, or the mediastinum. Diffuse disease and solitary lesions are equally approachable. Most TNBs are performed on an outpatient basis by using local anesthesia with or without conscious sedation. Virtually any location in the chest can be safely accessed by means of TNB. These percutaneous techniques are discussed in this article.\nThis article addresses biopsy of lesions that require transthoracic needle placement. Biopsy of the chest wall, ribs, and thoracic spine is included in Percutaneous Needle Technique Musculoskeletal Biopsy.\n\n\nKlein et al reported computed tomography-guided TNB (CT-TNB) as a safe and accurate technique in the pathologic diagnosis of sarcoidosis, particularly when core tissue specimens are obtained.\n [2] The authors studied the records of 41 biopsies in 41 patients (1997-2007) of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes for sarcoidosis. Core needle biopsy was shown to have a significantly higher yield than fine-needle aspiration cytology (96% vs 78%).\n [2] \nSimilarly, Kallenberg et al found that TNB is a safe diagnostic procedure in patients with hematologic malignancies and has the potential of making specific diagnoses with minimal morbidity.\n [3] In 53 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent TNB during 1999-2007, the most common underlying hematologic malignancy was non-Hodgkin lymphoma (20 patients). Lesions were most frequently located in the left upper lobe (16); 33 lesions were pleural based; and 9 had cavitation. TNB established specific diagnoses in 22 patients (malignancies in 12; infections in 10). Sensitivity for malignancy was 50.0%, sensitivity for infection was 40.0%, and there were no false-positive results. Complications included self-limited small-volume hemoptysis in one patient and pneumothoraces in eight patients, one of whom required chest tube placement. The results of TNB led to changes in antimicrobial therapy for 8 of the 22 patients with specific diagnoses.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nIn a more recent retrospective study (2012-2016) of 227 patients who underwent 223 CT-guided percutaneous TNB (PTNB) for pulmonary lesions, risk factors for hemoptysis during the procedure included lesions being subsolid and lesion depths more than 1 cm.\n [4] However, transversal through the central part of the lesion using PTNB was not a risk factor for procedure-related hemoptysis.\n\n\n\n\nIn a study of 105 patients, Tuna et al concluded that CT-guided biopsy is a safe and easy procedure that provides an accurate diagnosis of benign and malignant lung lesions without resulting in a meaningful increase in complications.\n [5]  Similar data were reported from a 2017 meta-analysis that evaluated complication rates of CT-guided transthoracic lung biopsies comprising data from 8,133 core biopsies procedures and 4,630 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) procedures.\n [6]  Minor complications were more common and more frequent in CT-guided core lung biopsies than FNA, but the rate of major complications was not only low but similar between the two procedures. Although no significant risk factors for complications were identified for core biopsies, those for FNA complications were smaller nodule diameter, larger needle diameter, and increased traversed lung parenchyma.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Transvenous Cardiac Pacing": "\nBackground\n\n\nThis article describes transvenous cardiac pacing. In a healthy heart, electrical impulses are generated in the sinoatrial (SA) node (sinus node), which is near the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right atrium (RA). The specialized cells of the SA node generate electrical impulses faster than other parts of the conduction system and with automaticity; therefore, these cells are usually the dominant natural pacemakers of the heart. The impulse is then conducted through the RA and left atrium (LA) and reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node.\nThe AV junction, which is at the base of the interatrial septum and extends into the interventricular septum, has two main parts: the AV node in the upper part, and the bundle of His in the lower part. In a healthy heart, the AV node is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. The inherent delay in transmitting the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles provides the appropriate diastolic duration to enable ventricular filling.\n\n\nThe His bundle divides into the left and right bundle branches and then into the Purkinje fibers, which conduct the impulse rapidly through the ventricles to produce rapid and simultaneous ventricular contractions. In general, symptomatic abnormalities of the conduction system are the main indications for cardiac pacing, a method by which a small pulsed electrical current is artificially delivered to the heart.\nOf the several methods for temporary pacing of the heart (transcutaneous, transvenous, transesophageal, transthoracic, and epicardial), transvenous and transcutaneous cardiac pacing are the most commonly used. The main factor that dictates the use of one approach instead of another is the urgency of the need for pacing.\n\n\n\n\nIn an emergency where a patient is experiencing cardiac symptoms or asystole, transcutaneous pacing is the method of choice. Nevertheless, transvenous pacing has the following advantages over the transcutaneous method:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Enhanced patient comfort\n         \n\n\n\n          Greater reliability\n         \n\n\n\n          Ability to pace the atrium\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, because transvenous pacing requires central venous access, it cannot be initiated as fast as transcutaneous pacing can, and it is associated with several complications that result from obtaining venous access.\n\nA common scenario is one in which transcutaneous pacing is employed first in an emergency, followed by transvenous placement of a lead that will enable a longer period of pacing and evaluation in patients who may require permanent pacing later during their hospitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Treadmill Stress Testing": "\nBackground\n\n\nExercise testing is a cardiovascular stress test that uses treadmill bicycle exercise with electrocardiography (ECG) and blood pressure monitoring.\n [1] Pharmacologic stress testing, established after exercise testing, is a diagnostic procedure in which cardiovascular stress induced by pharmacologic agents is demonstrated in patients with decreased functional capacity or in patients who cannot exercise. Pharmacologic stress testing is used in combination with imaging modalities such as radionuclide imaging and echocardiography.\n [2, 3] \nExercise stress testing, which is now widely available at a relatively low cost, is currently used most frequently to estimate prognosis and determine functional capacity, to assess the probability and extent of coronary disease, and to assess the effects of therapy. Ancillary techniques, such as metabolic gas analysis, radionuclide imaging (see the images below), and echocardiography, can provide further information that may be needed in selected patients, such as those with moderate or prior risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal radionuclide uptake (dipyridamole-Cardiolite). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal wall motion with radionuclide uptake. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardiovascular exercise stress testing in conjunction with ECG has been established as one of the focal points in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease, specifically coronary artery disease (CAD).\n [4, 5] Findings from the Henry Ford Exercse Testing (FIT) Project appear to indicate a graded, inverse relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and incident atrial fibrillation, particularly for obese patients.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nExercise physiology\nThe initiation of dynamic exercise results in increases in ventricular heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output as a result of vagal withdrawal and sympathetic stimulation. Alveolar ventilation and venous return also increase as a consequence of sympathetic vasoconstriction. The overall hemodynamic response depends on the amount of muscle mass involved, exercise efficiency, conditioning, and exercise intensity.\n\nIn the initial phases of exercise in the upright position, cardiac output is increased by an augmentation in stroke volume mediated through the use of the Frank-Starling mechanism and heart rate. The increase in cardiac output in the later phases of exercise is due primarily to an increase in ventricular rate.\n\nDuring strenuous exertion, sympathetic discharge is maximal and parasympathetic stimulation is withdrawn, resulting in autoregulation with generalized vasoconstriction, except in the vital organs (cerebral and coronary circulations).\n\nRelease of venous and arterial norepinephrine from sympathetic postganglionic nerve endings is increased, and epinephrine levels are increased at peak exertion, resulting in a rise in ventricular contractility. As exercise progresses, skeletal muscle blood flow increases; oxygen extraction increases as much as 3-fold; peripheral resistance decreases; and systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure usually increase. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remains unchanged or may increase or decrease by approximately 10 mm Hg.\n\nThe pulmonary vascular bed can accommodate as much as a 6-fold increase in cardiac output, with only modest increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and right atrial pressure; this is not a limiting determinant of peak exercise capacity in healthy subjects.\n\nMaximum heart rate and cardiac output are decreased in older individuals, in part because of decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness. Maximum heart rate can be calculated by subtracting the patient’s age (in years) from 220 (standard deviation, 10-12 beats/min).\n\nThe age-predicted maximum heart rate is a useful measurement for safety purposes and for estimating the adequacy of the stress to evoke inducible ischemia. A patient who reaches 80% of the age-predicted maximum is considered to have a good test result, and an age-predicted maximum of 90% or better is considered excellent.\n\nIn the postexercise phase, hemodynamics return to baseline within minutes after exercise is discontinued. The return of vagal stimulation is an important cardiac deceleration mechanism after exercise; it is more pronounced in well-trained athletes but is blunted in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.\n\nIntense physical work or important cardiorespiratory impairment may interfere with achievement of a steady state, and an oxygen deficit occurs during exercise. The oxygen debt is the total oxygen uptake in excess of the resting oxygen uptake during the recovery period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Vascular Access in Cardiac Catheterization and Intervention": "\nBackground\n\n\nCardiac catheterization is performed for both therapeutic and diagnostic reasons.\n [1, 2] Like any invasive procedure, cardiac catheterization is associated with complications, so the decision to undertake the procedure should be based on the risks and benefits.\nMore than a million cardiac catheterizations are performed each year in the United States. Several approaches to cardiac catheterization have been developed over the past 40 years. The three most widely used techniques for cardiac catheterization involve access through the femoral, radial, or brachial artery, with access to the brachial artery usually obtained by a cutdown approach and the others via a percutaneous approach.\n\n\nTraditionally, the heart has been accessed via the femoral artery; however, in the last decade, the radial artery has been more widely used, since it (1) is readily accessible (even in obese individuals), (2) is the preferred site of access by many patients, (3) is associated with a lower incidence of hemorrhage, and (4) allows earlier ambulation of the patient following the procedure than a femoral catheterization. Since the radial artery is of a smaller caliber than the femoral artery, the radial artery cannot accommodate large-size catheters, spasms in some cases (thereby preventing catheter passage), and occludes in 5%-10% of patients postprocedure, although this seldom causes symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Ventricular Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nVentricular repair, or cardiorrhaphy, has long been one of the most dramatic and lifesaving procedures performed in the emergency department (ED). Around 3000 BCE, in the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, the first reports of trauma to the thorax were described.\n [1]  The first successful human cardiorrhaphy was performed by the German physician Rehn in 1896 to repair a right ventricular injury sustained during a fencing match.\n [2] \nThe first successful cardiorrhaphy in the United States was performed by Hill in 1902; he operated on a teenage stabbing victim on a kitchen table in Montgomery, Alabama.\n [3]  This began the practice of emergency cardiac repair in patients who sustain life-threatening penetrating trauma to the heart.\n\n\nCardiac trauma is divided into two mechanisms, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nBlunt injuries - Cardiac rupture following blunt thoracic trauma usually causes death at the scene and is not typically encountered clinically\n          \n [4, 5, 6] \n\n\n\n\nPenetrating injuries - These are also commonly lethal but can be salvageable; the most common causes of death from penetrating trauma wounds are \n          cardiac tamponade and exsanguination; in contradistinction to other forms of trauma, preoperative resuscitation plays a limited role, and immediate surgical intervention is a superior determinant of survival\n          \n [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider cardiac injury in the differential whenever penetrating injury has occurred in the thorax or upper abdomen. The area of most concern is known as the cardiac box. This is an area of the trunk in which penetrating injuries risk damage to the heart. Anatomically, it is a triangular region bordered by the midclavicular lines laterally, the clavicles superiorly, and the costal margins inferiorly.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nClinical presentations can vary widely, from hemodynamically stable to cardiac arrest. Cardiac tamponade is commonly thought to correlate with the Beck triad (hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds), but these symptoms are found only in a minority of patients. Signs of shock (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, diaphoresis, and agitation) are better correlated with tamponade and should, therefore, be assessed.\n [7] \n\nThe chest radiograph does not commonly show an enlarged cardiac silhouette, even in the setting of acute tamponade. In cases of suspected penetrating cardiac injury, radiography should be used to assess for clues of cardiac injury, including retained intracardiac foreign bodies, hemothorax, pneumothorax, or pneumoperitoneum.\n [7, 14, 15]  For more information, see Pneumothorax Imaging.

It does have its limitations, however, in that it is both operator- and patient-dependent. It should be used primarily to direct and prioritize management.\n [16] \n\nAn essential part of the management of patients in extremis from cardiac injury is thoracotomy for cardiac resuscitation,\n [17] and possible cardiorrhaphy. The thoracotomy involves making a large incision to expose the heart, aorta and hilum. It allows for internal defibrillation and cardiac massage. Once the heart is exposed, a pericardial incision can be made to release any tamponade. The heart is then examined to look for any penetrating wounds. For a detailed description of this procedure, see Emergency Bedside Thoracotomy.\n\nMultiple methods are used in the emergency management of cardiac wounds, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Digital pressure - This method is used for small wounds and can be used to control bleeding on the way to the operating room (OR)\n         \n\n\n\n          Foley catheter: For larger wounds, a Foley catheter can be inserted through the wound and inflated, and with gentle traction, tamponade can be accomplished; placing a Foley catheter can also stop hemorrhage so that cardiorrhaphy can be performed or a patient can be transported to the OR for repair; an additional advantage of using the Foley catheter is the ability to administer intracardiac medications, fluids, or blood\n          \n [18, 19] \n\n\n\n\n          Immediate cardiorrhaphy (in the ED) - This method has been found to yield a survival rate up to 31% in patients presenting with penetrating cardiac injuries\n          \n [16] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n"

For the emergency medical technician, basic BVM ventilation is most often the only option for airway management.\n [2, 3, 4] \nIn the pediatric population, BVM may be the best option for prehospital airway support.\n [5, 6]  BVM ventilation is also appropriate for elective ventilation in the operating room (OR) when intubation is not required,\n [7]  but it is now often replaced in this setting by the laryngeal mask airway.\n [8] \n\n\nBVM ventilation requires a good seal and a patent airway. Practice with this important skill increases the clinician’s ability to provide effective ventilation. Adjuncts such as oral and nasal airways can aid with ventilation by relieving physiologic obstruction and by opening up the hypopharynx. Certain factors predict difficult BVM ventilation. These include the presence of facial hair, lack of teeth, a body mass index (BMI) greater than 26, age older than 55 years, and a history of snoring.\n [9] \nMasks come in many sizes, including newborn, infant, child, and adult (small, medium, and large). Choosing the appropriate size helps create a good seal and thereby facilitates effective ventilation.\n\n\n\n\nBags for BVM ventilation also come in different types. Newer bags are equipped with a pressure valve. Some bags have one-way expiratory valves to prevent the entry of room air; these allow for delivery of more than 90% oxygen to ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients. Bags lacking this feature deliver a high concentration of oxygen during positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) but deliver only 30% oxygen during spontaneous breaths.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Barotrauma and Mechanical Ventilation": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nBarotrauma is a well-recognized complication of mechanical ventilation.\n [1] Although most frequently encountered in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it can occur in any patient receiving mechanical ventilation.\n [2, 3]  In addition, barotrauma can occur in patients with a wide range of underlying pulmonary conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], interstitial lung disease, or Pneumocystis jiroveci [Pneumocystis carinii] pneumonia).\nIn clinical medicine, barotrauma is used to describe the manifestations of extra-alveolar air during mechanical ventilation. Early descriptions of barotrauma refer to rupture of the lung after forceful exhalation against a closed glottis—for example, pulmonary injury after a deep-sea dive (eg, breath-holding while pearl diving). Although nonmechanically ventilated patients may have barotrauma, most cases occur in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nThe clinical presentation can vary, ranging from absent symptoms with the subtle radiographic findings of pulmonary (or perivascular) interstitial emphysema (PIE) to respiratory distress or cardiac arrest due to a large tension pneumothorax.\n [4]  Other manifestations include subcutaneous emphysema, pneumopericardium, pneumomediastinum, and even pneumoperitoneum, singly or in combination.\nBarotrauma was once the most frequent and easily recognized complication of mechanical ventilation. It is now evident, however, that barotrauma represents only one of the mechanisms underlying the broad category of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).\n [5]  As the term suggests, the lung injury associated with barotrauma is mediated by increased alveolar pressures.\n\n\n\n\nOther manifestations of VILI have been termed volutrauma, atelectotrauma, and biotrauma (cytokine- and chemokine-mediated) to reflect the major pathophysiologic events behind the injury.\n\n\n\n\nImproved understanding of the mechanisms underlying VILI and barotrauma makes it imperative for physicians to adjust ventilator settings to prevent alveolar overdistention. There has been controversy regarding the optimal approach for lung-protective ventilation, but consistent benefit has been noted with low tidal volume and no increased risk with varying levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Whereas low-tidal-volume ventilation has been strongly advocated, plateau pressure may be a more useful parameter to monitor and a better reflection of barotrauma risk in these patients.\n\nLow tidal volume is an effective ventilation strategy, but clinicians have been somewhat slow to adopt this approach. With increasing evidence to support its use, the overall tidal volume used in mechanically ventilated patients had decreased over time, and current practice involves tidal volumes that are lower than those used in the past. Limiting plateau pressures to less than 30 cm H2O is an effective approach for all patients. With volume ventilators, this is best accomplished with low tidal volumes. It also appears that a pressure-limited approach can be effective.\n\nFor more information, see Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Bronchial Thermoplasty": "\nBackground\n\n\nBronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a modality for treating asthma and is thought to prevent the chronic structural changes that occur in airway smooth muscle (ASM) in individuals with asthma.\n [1] BT targets ASM via the delivery of a controlled specific amount of radiofrequency (RF) energy (RF ablation [RFA]) to the airway wall through a dedicated catheter.\nAsthma is a complex inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and variable airflow obstruction. Although advances in clinical and basic research over the past few decades have led to the development of effective treatments and dissemination of detailed disease management guidelines,\n [2, 3, 4, 5] difficult-to-treat asthma continues to affect 5-10% of adults with this disorder.\n [6] \n\n\nTreating these patients is an ever-evolving challenge and is a major source of frustration for the patients and clinicians alike. Most patients with difficult-to-treat asthma require three or four medications and long-term oral corticosteroids or frequent bursts.\n [7] The development of alternative therapies has offered the advantage of avoiding the major side effect of steroids.\n [8] \nDespite these expensive therapies, patients with difficult-to-treat asthma account for a disproportionately high share of asthma-associated morbidity and mortality and continue to experience repeated symptoms, including potentially life-threatening exacerbations.\n [9] This population not only is responsible for a large economic cost but also has a large impact on society in terms of missed work or school.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nCost considerations\nThough patients with severe asthma constitute 5-10% of the asthma population, severe asthma consumes a disproportionate percentage (~50%) of the global asthma budget, secondary to unscheduled physician visits, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations, along with the costs of pharmacotherapy.\n\n\n\n\nThe high use of resources for this group of patients, along with the increased morbidity and mortality, led to the formation of the European, American, and global severe asthma networks with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the pathogenesis and thereby becoming better able to direct optimal management. One of the major challenges in the treatment of asthma is how to select those patients that would respond best to a specific therapy.\n [11] \n\nA 5-year budget impact analysis was performed in Italy.\n [12] This study, the first of its kind, evaluated adding adjuvant BT to the standard care with or without adjuvant omalizumab. The authors concluded that despite the increase in direct costs due to the add-on therapies, the overall long-term cost was less, with a decrease in the number of ED visits and hospitalizations.\n [13, 12] \n\nIn a study of commercially insured patients, based on a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating 5-year healthcare utilization along with patient quality of life and adverse events, BT was shown to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with severe persistent asthma.\n [14] \n\nBecause BT is associated with a very high direct cost, insurance coverage has been a prominent issue.\n [15] In the United States, BT is covered by multiple commercial payers. It is also covered by multiple, though not all, health plans, and some health plans that do not routinely cover it may still consider it on a case-by-case basis and provide coverage on the basis of case-specific medical necessity.\n\nPayers with noncoverage policies have typically used a number of reasons for maintaining such policies. Many plans have described BT as an “experimental and investigational” procedure, suggesting that further study is necessary before coverage is appropriate. It is always recommended that patients confirm commercial insurance coverage before starting this therapeutic modality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Bronchoplasty": "\nBackground\n\n\nBronchoplasty is a reconstruction or repair of the bronchus to restore the integrity of the lumen. Bronchoplasty, or vascular reconstruction, is a technique in which 2 separate pieces of bronchus or vessels are reanastomosed. The most common indication for bronchospasm is lung neoplasm.\n [1]  Various novel techniques have been used to treat a wide range of pathologic conditions. Bronchoplastic procedures for benign and low-grade malignant tumors of the airway and benign stenosis allow preservation of maximum amount of pulmonary parenchyma (see the image below).\n [2, 3] Benign and low-grade malignancies require only minimally clear margins for cure and are ideally suited to bronchoplastic resections. In typical lung resection procedures, any airway involved with tumor is resected with its associated lung parenchyma. This results in extensive resections in the setting of central tumors involving the proximal airways. With bronchoplastic techniques, the involved airway may be resected to negative margins and the remaining ends anastomosed, thus preserving the distal lung parenchyma.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\n\nTracheal stenosis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nBronchoplastic techniques can also be used to repair traumatic airway injuries and benign strictures.\nTypes of bronchoplasty\nSurgical bronchoplasty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgical bronchoplasty involves reconstruction or anastomosis of bronchus after lung procedures such as lobectomy, sleeve resection, wedge resection, and pulmonary artery angioplasty. In its most common form, this procedure involves resection of a portion of the airway without resection of the associated lung parenchyma and reconstruction of the airway with bronchial anastomosis (sleeve resection).\n\nThe typical scenario is a centrally located upper lobe lung cancer involving the origin of the right upper lobe bronchus and the origin of the bronchus intermedius. Without use of bronchoplastic techniques, a pneumonectomy would be required, but a right upper lobectomy may be performed with the resection extending to involve the proximal bronchus intermedius and reanastomosis of the right mainstem bronchus to the bronchus intermedius, thus preserving the right lower lobe. Tumors involving the main branches of the pulmonary artery can similarly be resected with pulmonary artery sleeve resection and reanastomosis.\n\nBalloon bronchoplasty\n\nBalloon bronchoplasty involves the use of balloons for symptomatic airway stenosis. Balloon bronchoplasty is a procedure essential to practice of interventional bronchoscopy. It is performed with both flexible and rigid bronchoscopy. This technique is generally used in conjunction with other techniques (eg, electrocautery, stent deployment).\n\nThermal bronchoplasty or bronchial thermoplasty (BT)\n\nSevere asthmatics have increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) responsible for bronchoconstriction and increased resistance of airway. BT is a novel treatment modality that uses radiofrequency energy to reduce ASM mass and resistance of airway. It is safe, improves quality of life, and decreases severity and frequency of asthma exacerbations.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Bronchovascular Sleeve Resection": "\nBackground\n\n\nDouble sleeve (bronchovascular) lobectomy is a feasible alternative to pneumonectomy if a complete resection can be achieved in patients with centrally located non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involving both the bronchus and the pulmonary artery (PA).\nTraditionally, this technique has mainly been performed through a posterolateral thoracotomy, because of the high complexity of the airway anatomy and of arterial reconstruction. Technical advances and more experience gained in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) over the past few decades have allowed some surgeons to achieve proficiency in performing double sleeve lobectomies by VATS.\n [1, 2]  The introduction of robotic-assisted technology in thoracic surgery has spurred interest in performing more complex operations, and a few cases describing double sleeve resections with a robotic approach have been reported.\n [3, 4, 5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

The most common cause of a lung bulla is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Other conditions associated with lung bullae are alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, cocaine smoking, sarcoidosis, HIV infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, and intravenous (IV) drug abuse.\nBullae increase physiologic dead space and compress surrounding normal lung tissue. Giant bullae also exert pressure on the diaphragm and effect its contractility. The natural history of bullae is one of enlargement causing worsening of dyspnea; however, the rate of expansion is unpredictable. The clinical course of a giant bulla can be complicated by a pneumothorax and fluid accumulation within the bulla.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Decortication": "\nBackground\n\n\nDecortication is a surgical procedure that removes a restrictive layer of fibrous tissue overlying the lung, chest wall, and diaphragm. The aim of decortication is to remove this layer and allow the lung to reexpand. When the peel is removed, compliance in the chest wall returns, the lung is able to expand and deflate, and patient symptoms improve rapidly.\n [1] \nIn most people, the pleural space is less than 1 mm thick. When this space is violated by any number of pathologic disorders, the distribution of certain cells and fluid can be altered, with serious medical consequences.\n [2]  One common pathologic process that affects the pleural space is fibrothorax, which is an abnormal accumulation of fibrous tissues over the lung or visceral pleura. The deposition of fibrous tissues over the lung parenchyma can be so intense that the underlying lung fails to expand. Over time, the lung becomes entrapped or encased.\n [1] \n\n\nAlthough decortication is an effective surgical procedure for this condition, its success depends on careful selection of patients. As in all thoracic surgery procedures, the preoperative workup should be thorough, and the surgery should be done at a particular timed interval. Moreover, the surgeon should also be technically skilled at entering the chest and removing the peel. In some cases, the intercostal space is fused, and it is almost impossible to enter the chest cavity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Diaphragm Pacing": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe history of pacing the diaphragm is not new. The earliest record of phrenic stimulation for the treatment of asphyxia was reported in 1783. In the mid-1850s, French neurologists also proposed such an idea, but it was Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen who performed the first diaphragmatic pacing on a young female patient who had asphyxiated on charcoal vapor. Several decades later, Duchenne also commended the benefits of diaphragmatic stimulation. Diaphragmatic stimulation did not gain any momentum because of the crude nature of surgery and lack of appropriate anesthesia. The technique was revived about a century later by Sarnoff and colleagues at Harvard, where they paced the phrenic nerve in dogs. Later, they applied the technique to a young child with complete respiratory paralysis following an intracranial aneurysm rupture. However, the true beginnings of diaphragmatic pacing started in the 1860s and 70s. The father of modern diaphragm pacing is Dr William W L Glenn from Yale University, who showed that the technique was not only practical but could be used clinically for the treatment for several medical disorders. With advances in technology, more refined and flexible electrodes were developed, and the thoracoscopic method of implantation became practical.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \nThere are 3 commercially available devices that can stimulate the diaphragm—namely, the Synapse Biomedical NeuRx; the Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker, made by Avery Biomedical Devices; and the Atrotech OY's Atrostim PNS. The Avery and the Synapse devices are available in the United States, and the Atrotech device is available only in Europe. The Synapse NeuRx DPS received FDA approval in 2011 for humanitarian use in patients 21 years or older with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the cost may not be reimbursed by Medicaid or Medicare services. The Avery  Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker received full premarket approval by the FDA in 1987 and is reimbursed by Medicaid and Medicare services. A key difference between the two is that the Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker stimulates the phrenic nerve and the NeuRx DPS stimulates the diaphragm.\n [6, 7] \n\n\nCurrently, several clinical centers offer diaphragm pacing for selected patients.\n [1, 2, 8, 9, 3, 4] \nAll currently available systems involve an external transmitter and an implanted receiver, but fully implantable diaphragmatic pacing systems are being developed.

First established in the 1930s, clinical use of EtCO2 measurement became accessible in the 1950s with the production and distribution of capnograph monitors.\n [1, 2] \nWith continuous technologic advancements, EtCO2 monitoring has become a key component in the advancement of patient safety within anesthesiology, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) has endorsed end-tidal capnography as a standard of care for general anesthesia and moderate or deep procedural sedation.\n [3, 4]  \n\n\nStudies showed that during cardiac arrest, EtCO2 values of greater than 10-20 mm Hg are associated with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).\n [5, 6, 7, 8]  Accordingly, other specialties, including critical care and emergency medicine,\n [9] began to implement end-tidal capnography monitoring more frequently, though there remains room for greater uptake of this life-saving technology outside of the operating room.\n [10, 11, 12] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Endobronchial Ultrasound": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a technique that uses ultrasound along with bronchoscopy to visualize the airway wall and structures adjacent to it. The clinical application and diagnostic benefit of EBUS have been established in many studies. EBUS has been incorporated into routine practice in many centers because of its high diagnostic value and low risk. It allows real-time guidance of transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of mediastinal and hilar structures and parabronchial lung masses. As use of EBUS and EBUS-TBNA continues to grow, ongoing education in advanced bronchoscopic procedures is necessary to guarantee competency and successful patient outcomes.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \nTwo types of EBUS exist: radial probe EBUS (RP-EBUS) and convex probe EBUS (CP-EBUS). Physicians should have knowledge of mediastinal lymph node stations and sonographic anatomy of the airway wall. The endobronchial ultrasound image visualizes distinct layers of the bronchial wall with mucosa, submucosa, endochondrium, cartilage, perichondrium, connective tissue, and adventitia. The mucosa, endochondrium, perichondrial layer, and adventitia are hyperechoic, while the submucosa, cartilage, and connective tissue appear hypoechoic.\n\n\nPatients should not eat or drink at least 6 hrs before the procedure, and the patient may need to discontinue blood thinning medications several days before the procedure. \nIndications\nStaging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) has higher diagnostic yield than conventional TBNA in all lymph node stations except subcarinal lymph nodes in determining the lymph node involvement in NSCLC.\n [8] Its ability to precisely visualize the airway wall invasion helps to categorize the tumor (T) component of staging and surgical resection planning.\n [9] It can be combined with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration to near complete sampling of mediastinum using a single endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope.\n [10] It can also be used to restage lung cancer in the mediastinum.\n [11]  A 22- or 21-gauge EBUS needle is recommended for lung cancer diagnosis and staging.\n [12]  In cases in which additional sample tissue is needed, a 19-gauge needle may provide an increased diagnostic yield.\n [13, 14] \n\nIn a study of 209 patients who underwent sampling of hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes for the diagnosis/staging of lung cancer (99 EBUS-TBNA vs 110 c-TBNA), EBUS-TBNA was found to have significantly better results than conventional TBNA in terms of diagnostic accuracy (94.2% vs 89.7%), sample adequacy (70.3% vs 42%), and sensitivity (93% vs 86.4%) for lymph nodes < 2 cm. There were no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy, adequacy, and sensitivity for lymph nodes ≥2 cm.\n [15] \n\nEvaluation of mediastinal lesions, intrapulmonary pulmonary nodules, and endobronchial lesions\n\nEBUS can visualize and allow physicians to sample and diagnose various mediastinal abnormalities,\n [16] including sarcoidosis\n [17, 18, 19, 20] and mediastinal lymphoma.\n [21, 22, 23, 24] It can characterize the intraparenchymal and endobronchial lesions and help to determine the likelihood of malignancy based on appearance. EBUS-TBNA can visualize and allow sampling of pulmonary nodules that are not visualized by fluoroscopy and may avert the need for surgical procedures.\n [25] RP-EBUS is a relatively accurate tool in the investigation of peripheral pulmonary lesions.\n [26] \n\nGuidance of endobronchial therapy\n\nEBUS can provide useful additional information during nterventions such as resection of endobronchial lesions, stricture dilatation, stenting, laser therapy, and argon plasma coagulation.\n [27] \n\nContraindications\nContraindications to endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) are similar to contraindications to flexible bronchoscopy and include following:\n\n\n\n\n\nLife-threatening cardiac arrhythmias\n\n\n\n\nCurrent or recent myocardial ischemia\n\n\n\n\nPoorly controlled heart failure\n\n\n\n\nSevere hypoxemia\n\n\n\n\nUncooperative patient\n\n\n\nAdditional contraindications to EBUS-TBNA are related to bleeding risk and include following:\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent antiplatelet agents\n [28] \n\n\n\n\nCurrent anticoagulant therapy\n\n\n\n\nCoagulopathy\n\n\n\n\nThrombocytopenia\n\n\n\n\nElevated blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine\n\n\n\nPreparation\nAnesthesia\n\nEBUS is usually performed under procedural sedation and local anesthesia. Local anesthesia on airways is done by nebulizing 1% or 2% lidocaine and spraying lidocaine spray in the posterior pharynx. A 1-2 mL of 1% to 2% lidocaine can be installed through the working channel of bronchoscope during insertion and procedure, if needed. EBUS can be done under general anesthesia. The use of a laryngeal mask airway allows access to upper paratracheal nodes, which may not be accessible with an endotracheal tube in place. The size of the endotracheal tube should be at least No. 8 or larger, to accommodate the CP-EBUS bronchoscope. The patient should be NPO for at least 6 hours.\n\nEquipment\n\nRP-EBUS probe\n\nThe RP-EBUS probe has an ultrasound processor and a balloon catheter attached to it. The balloon is fixed at the tip of the probe. If overinflation or excessive pressure occurs, the balloon slips from the tip and a small amount of water is released from the balloon to prevent balloon rupture. The 20 MHz miniature radial probe is the standard probe. The 30 MHz miniature radial probe provides a more detailed image of the airway wall and surrounding structures. These 2 probes have a diameter of 2.5 mm; therefore, a flexible bronchoscope with a working channel of 2.8 mm is required to use it. The 20 MHz ultra-miniature radial probe has a smaller diameter than either miniature radial probe, so it can be inserted through the 2 mm working channel of a bronchoscope and can extend further into subsegmental bronchi than the miniature radial probe.\n\nCP-EBUS bronchoscope\n\nThe CP-EBUS bronchoscope has a linear curved-array ultrasonic transducer of 7.5 MHz at the distal tip, which has the capability of displaying B-mode and color Doppler mode.\n [29] \n\nThe field of view is 80 degrees, and the direction of view is 35 degrees forward oblique. The outer diameter of the bronchoscope is 6.2 mm, and the inner channel diameter is 2 mm. The dedicated 22-gauge needle has an echogenic dimpled tip to enhance visibility by ultrasound. The maximum extruding stroke is 40 mm with a safety mechanism that stops at 20 mm. The needle has an internal sheath that prevents contamination of samples by bronchial wall tissue.\n\nPositioning\n\nEBUS is usually performed with the patient in the supine position, with the operator standing at the head of the bed. The bronchoscopist should have a clear view ofthe  monitor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Eucapnic Hyperventilation (Eucapnic Voluntary Hyperventilation [EVH])": "\nBackground\n\n\nEucapnic hyperventilation (eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation [EVH]) is a provocative indirect stimulus test used to diagnose exercise-induced asthma (EIA) (defined in a patient with preexisting asthma who has an exacerbation of the asthma with exercise) or exercise-induced bronchospasm. Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) is considered if the patient has no evidence of asthma except during or after exercise.\n [1, 2] \nProlonged exercise at high ventilatory rates causes airway cooling and drying. Vessel dilation in response to the cooling induces airway edema, and the drying causes osmotic changes and inflammation at the airway surface resulting in EIB.\n [3] Approximately 90% of people with untreated asthma experience bronchoconstriction during exercise, but individuals without asthma can also be diagnosed with EIB. Rates of EIB are particularly high among elite athletes.\n [1, 4] \n\n\nTraditionally, cardiopulmonary tests (CPET) have been used to diagnose EIB, but indirect bronchoprovocation tests such as EVH can be used to accurately identify individuals who do not have EIB.\n [5] \nThe EVH test was designed to mimic the effect that prolonged exercise has on the airways. The patient breathes a specific gas mixture (21% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and balance nitrogen) at a high minute ventilation for 6 minutes. Spirometry is done at 0, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after the test. A 10% drop in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) at any point after the EVH test is considered positive for EIB.\n\n\n\n\nOriginally developed by the military to evaluate young active-duty soldiers for unexplained shortness of breath, EVH is used approved by The International Olympic committee and World Anti-Doping Code to confirm the diagnosis of EIB for preventive and treatment-related medications to be used in competition.\n [1, 6] EVH is an important tool for clinicians who treat athletes, whether they are elite or recreational. It has also been used to detect EIB in patients with cystic fibrosis.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nThe two types of provocative tests are direct and indirect. Indirect provocation tests such as EVH, mannitol, or hypertonic saline are more specific for asthma than hyperresponsiveness to a direct stimulus such as methacholine.\n [8, 9] Eucapnic hyperventilation is also more sensitive than sport-specific field exercise.\n [8] However, a substantial number of athletes with no symptoms will have a positive EVH test using the 10% criterion. In a review of EVH results from 224 elite or international-level athletes who were completely asymptomatic and had normal lung function, almost every study subject had some degree of bronchoconstriction after EVH, and 20% of subjects met the 10% criterion. Although, given the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, none of these persons would be diagnosed with EIB.\n [10] \n\nEVH can be used among pediatric patients aged 10-16 years to evaluate exercise-induced dyspnea. A good cutoff value for diagnosis is a minimum 10% fall in FEV1.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nOverview\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is breathing 100% oxygen while under increased atmospheric pressure. HBOT is a treatment that can be traced back to the 1600s. The first well-known chamber was built and run by a British clergyman named Henshaw. He built a structure called the domicilium that was used to treat a multitude of diseases.\n [1] The chamber was pressurized with air or unpressurized using bellows. The idea of treating patients under increased pressure was continued by the French surgeon Fontaine, who built a pressurized, mobile operating room in 1879.\n [2] Dr. Orville Cunningham, a professor of anesthesia, ran what was known as the \"Steel Ball Hospital.\" The structure, erected in 1928, was 6 stories high and 64 feet in diameter. The hospital could reach 3 atmospheres of pressure.\n [2] The hospital was closed in 1930 because of the lack of scientific evidence indicating that such treatment alleviated disease. It was deconstructed during World War II for scrap.\n\n\nThe military continued work with hyperbaric oxygen. The work of Paul Bert, who demonstrated the toxic effects of oxygen (producing generalized seizures), as well as the work of J. Lorrain-Smith, who demonstrated pulmonary oxygen toxicity, were used with Navy divers. Exposure times to oxygen at different depths of water (and, hence, different levels of pressure) were quantified and tested based on time to convulsions.\n [2] \nThe United States may have an inadequate number of HBOT treatment facilities. Of the 361 chambers identified nationwide, only 43 were equipped to handle high-acuity patients. HBOT is instrumental in treating decompression sickness, arterial gas embolisms, and acute carbon monoxide poisoning.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nOxygen chambers\nWhen a patient is given 100% oxygen under pressure, hemoglobin is saturated, but the blood can be hyperoxygenated by dissolving oxygen within the plasma. The patient can be administered systemic oxygen via two basic chambers: Type A, multiplace; and Type B, monoplace. Both types can be used for routine wound care, treatment of most dive injuries, and treatment of patients who are ventilated or in critical care.\n\n\n\n\nMultiplace chamber\n\nMultiplace chambers treat multiple patients at the same time, generally with a nurse or another inside observer who monitors the patients and assists with equipment manipulation or emergencies (see images below). Patients in a multiplace chamber breathe 100% oxygen via a mask or close-fitting plastic hood. Multiplace chambers can usually be pressurized to the equivalent of about six atmospheres of pressure.\n\nIf a different mixture of gas (nitrogen or helium mixture) is desired, the mixture can be given, via the mask, to only the patient, not the employee. All equipment used with patients, such as ventilators and intravenous lines, is put into the chamber with the patient. Since the employee is breathing air during the treatment (not using a mask), his or her nitrogen intake must be monitored, as this presents a risk for problems similar to those sometimes developed by scuba divers (eg, decompression sickness [DCS]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRectangular hyperbaric chamber. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior of rectangular chamber. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCylindrical multiplace chamber. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nMonoplace chamber\n\nA monoplace chamber compresses one person at a time, usually in a reclining position (see image below). The gas used to pressurize the vessel is usually 100% oxygen. Some chambers have masks available to provide an alternate breathing gas (such as air). Employees tend to the patient from outside of the chamber and equipment remains outside the chamber. Only certain intravenous lines and ventilation ducts penetrate through the hull. Newer Duoplace chambers can hold two people. Their operation is similar to that of a monoplace chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoplace chamber. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nOther chambers\n\nTwo other types of chambers are worth mentioning, although they are not considered HBOT.\n\nTopical oxygen, or Topox, is administered through a small chamber that is placed over an extremity and pressurized with oxygen. The patient does not breathe the oxygen, nor is the remainder of the body pressurized. Therefore, the patient cannot benefit from most of the positive effects of HBOT, which are systemic or occur at a level deeper than topical oxygen can penetrate (see Hyperbaric Physics and Physiology section below). Topox is based on the concept that oxygen diffuses through tissue at a depth of 30-50 microns.\n [4] This method does not treat DCS, arterial gas emboli (AGE), or carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.\n\nAnother problem with Topox is the design of the unit. A pressure differential must be created between the machine and open atmosphere to compress the machine. In order to keep the extremity from being pushed out of the pressurized machine, the cuff of the box must fit very tightly around the extremity, thereby creating a tourniquetlike effect. Topox is not covered by insurance, nor is it endorsed by the journal Diabetes Care for the treatment of foot ulcers.\n [5] \n\nThe other type of chamber is the portable \"mild\" hyperbaric chamber. These soft vessels can be pressurized to 1.5-1.7 atmospheres absolute (ATA). They are only approved by the FDA for the treatment of altitude illness. The number of these chambers has increased, as they are being used more commonly in off-label indications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Laryngeal Mask Airway": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device developed by British Anesthesiologist Dr. Archi Brain. It has been in use since 1988. Initially designed for use in the operating room as a method of elective ventilation, it is a good alternative to bag-valve-mask ventilation, freeing the hands of the provider with the benefit of less gastric distention.\n [1, 2] Initially used primarily in the operating room setting, the LMA has more recently come into use in the emergency setting as an important accessory device for management of the difficult airway.\n [3, 4] \nThe LMA is shaped like a large endotracheal tube on the proximal end that connects to an elliptical mask on the distal end. It is designed to sit in the patient’s hypopharynx and cover the supraglottic structures, thereby allowing relative isolation of the trachea. The patient should be obtunded and unresponsive before one of these devices is placed.\n\n\nThe LMA is a good airway device in many settings, including the operating room, the emergency department, and out-of-hospital care, because it is easy to use and quick to place, even for the inexperienced provider.\n [5, 6, 7] A success rate for placement of a LMA of nearly 100% occurs in the operating room. A lower rate of achievement for LMA placement may be expected in the emergency setting.\n [8] Its use results in less gastric distention than with bag-valve-mask ventilation, which reduces but does not eliminate the risk of aspiration.\n [9, 10] This may be particularly pertinent in patients who have not fasted before being ventilated.\nLaryngeal mask airways come in several types, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LMA Classic is the original reusable design.\n\n\n\n\nThe LMA Unique is a disposable version, making it ideal for emergency and prehospital settings.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nThe LMA Fastrach, an intubating LMA (ILMA), is designed to serve as a conduit for intubation.\n [12] Although most LMA designs can serve this purpose, the LMA Fastrach has special features that increase the rate of successful intubation and do not limit the size of the endotracheal tube (ETT). These features include an insertion handle, a rigid shaft with anatomical curvature, and an epiglottic elevating bar designed to lift the epiglottis as the ETT passes.\n\n\n\n\nThe LMA Flexible has softer tubing. It is not used the in the emergency setting.\n\n\n\n\nThe LMA ProSeal has the addition of a channel for the suctioning of gastric contents. It also allows for 50% higher pressures without a leak. However, it does not permit blind intubation and is not currently used in the emergency setting.\n\n\n\n\nThe LMA Supreme, which is a newer design, is similar to the ProSeal and has a built-in bite block.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\nAnother newer design is the LMA CTrach, which inserts like the LMA Fastrach and has built-in fiberoptics with a video screen that affords a direct view of the larynx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The light serves to guide the tube into the larynx; direct visualization of the glottis is not required for successful use.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nIntubation under direct vision may be difficult or impossible in 1-3% of surgical patients and 0.05-3.5% of obstetric patients.\n [4, 5]  Light-guided intubation using transillumination has proved to be simple and effective. When the tip of the lightwand is placed inside the glottis, a bright glow can be seen in the anterior soft tissue of the neck. In contrast, if the lightwand is placed in the esophagus, no transillumination is observed.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of light-guided tracheal intubation include utility in obstructed conditions, low acquisition costs, and disposable components that eliminate the need for disinfection of the equipment. A distinct disadvantage is that room lights must be dimmed during the procedure. The procedure also requires a fair amount of user experience.\n [1, 6, 7, 8, 9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Lung Segmentectomy and Limited Pulmonary Resection": "\nBackground\n\n\nAlthough lung segmentectomy has always been popular for resection of suppurative lesions and nonmalignant masses, some experts have also recommended it for very early lung cancer.\n [1, 2, 3] The choice for patients with lung cancer is usually a lobectomy, but in some patients with minimal lung reserve, lung segmentectomy may be an option.\n [4, 5, 6] \nThe essence of lung segmentectomy is to remove the lung disease without removing excess normal lung. Because the technique is technically demanding, some surgeons simply prefer to wedge out the lung lesion using a stapler. However, the recurrence rate after a wedge resection remains higher.\n [7] \n\n\nWith the resurgence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and development of drug-resistant strains, lung segmentectomy is again becoming a popular technique.\n [8] Segmentectomy and extended lung resection are also used to treat various fungal infections and congenital lung malformations.\nBoth lobectomy and pneumonectomy are widely used to treat cancerous lesions of the lung. However, many thoracic patients have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or emphysema and have minimal lung reserve. These patients simply are not able to tolerate extensive lung resections. Segmentectomy is a good option in such patients.\n\n\n\n\nBoth segmentectomy and lesser lung resections can be performed via thoracotomy or via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).\n [9, 10, 11] VATS is fast becoming an option for most patients with thoracic pathology. The technique has been shown to yield better outcomes, less pain, and shorter recovery than traditional techniques.\n\n\n\n\nVATS is currently the criterion standard for both lesser lung resections and segmentectomy. VATS is a better choice than thoracotomy in these settings and is performed with general anesthesia using a camera and a small non-rib-spreading incision. The technique of lesser lung resection and segmentectomy is very similar to the open technique, except that instruments are used to retract and dissect the segmental planes.\n [9] \n\nMany surgeons remove isolated lung lesions with a wedge resection using VATS.\n [12] Wedge resection saves time but involves removal of a significant amount of normal lung tissue. Wedge resection is appropriate only for noncancerous lesions or for resecting metastatic lesions. The standard of care for malignant lesions is still lobectomy.\n [13] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Mechanical Ventilation": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe Roman physician Galen first used mechanical breathing in the second century by blowing air into the larynx of a dead animal using a reed. Author George Poe used a mechanical respirator to revive an asphyxiated dog.\n [1] The Drinker and Shaw tank-type ventilator of 1929 was one of the first negative-pressure machines widely used for mechanical ventilation. Better known as the iron lung, this metal cylinder completely engulfed the patient up to the neck. A vacuum pump created negative pressure in the chamber, which resulted in expansion of the patient's chest. This change in chest geometry reduced the intrapulmonary pressure and allowed ambient air to flow into the patient's lungs. When the vacuum was terminated, the negative pressure applied to the chest dropped to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest and lungs permitted passive exhalation (see image below). \n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the Drinker and Shaw negative-pressure ventilator (iron lung). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nVentilation of the patient was accomplished without the placement of a tracheostomy or an endotracheal tube. Nevertheless, this mode of ventilation was cumbersome and led to patient discomfort. In addition, it limited access to the patient by health care providers. Because the negative pressure created in the chamber was exerted on the abdomen as well as the chest, the cardiac output tended to decrease from pooling of venous blood in the lower torso.\nToday, negative-pressure ventilation is used in only a few situations. The cuirass, or shell unit, allows negative pressure to be applied only to the patient's chest by using a combination of a form-fitted shell and a soft bladder. It provides a suitable and attractive option for patients with neuromuscular disorders, especially those with residual muscular function, because it does not require a tracheostomy with its inherent problems.\n\n\n\n\nConcepts that the military developed during World War II to deliver oxygen and gas volume to fighter pilots operating at high altitude were incorporated into the design of the modern positive-pressure ventilator. With the development of safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume, low-pressure cuffs, positive-pressure ventilation replaced the iron lung.\n\n\n\n\nIntensive use of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation gained momentum during the polio epidemic in Scandinavia and the United States in the early 1950s. In Copenhagen, the patient with polio and respiratory paralysis who was supported by manually forcing 50% oxygen through a tracheostomy had a reduced mortality rate. However, this heroic intervention required the continuous activity of 1400 medical students recruited from the universities. The overwhelming manpower needed, coupled with a decrease in mortality rate from 80% to 25%, led to the adaptation of the positive-pressure machines used in the operating room for use in the ICU.\n\nPositive-pressure ventilation means that airway pressure is applied at the patient's airway through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive nature of the pressure causes the gas to flow into the lungs until the ventilator breath is terminated. As the airway pressure drops to zero, elastic recoil of the chest accomplishes passive exhalation by pushing the tidal volume out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Medical Thoracoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nMedical thoracoscopy or pleuroscopy is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure utilized by pulmonologists to evaluate, diagnose, and treat plueral pathologies of the lung, mainly pleural effusions. The term thoracoscopy creates confusion because it refers to both the medical and surgical procedures. To avoid confusion, some authors suggest that medical thoracoscopy should be referred to as pleuroscopy. Thoracoscopy may be used exclusively for the surgical video-assisted thoracoscopic procedure (VATS).  \n\n\nBackground\nMedical thoracoscopy was initially performed in 1910 by an internist from Sweden named Hans-Christian Jacobaeus. Jacobaeus was the first to use the term thoracoscopy, which he described as \"replacing fluid with air\" in order to examine the pleural surfaces of two patients with tuberculous pleurisy. Jacobaeus later developed a therapeutic application for thoracoscopy by using thermocautery to lyse adhesions and create a pneumothorax to treat tuberculosis.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, thoracoscopy gained popularity with pulmonologists because of the tuberculosis endemic in the United States. The major indications were for pleural and pulmonary biopsies for diffuse lung disease. However, with the advent of effective chemotherapy for tuberculosis, the need for thoracoscopy decreased. Surgeons adopted the procedure after advances in optics, laparoscopic techniques, and video technology. Thoracoscopy grew into the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery that is currently performed by thoracic surgeons.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nThe accepted indications for medical thoracoscopy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and diagnosis of idiopathic pleural effusions \n\n\n\n\nPleurodesis\n\n\n\n\nSite-directed biopsy of parietal pleura\n\n\n\n\nStaging of lung cancer\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nStaging for mesothelioma\n\n\n\nPleural effusion of unknown origin\n\nIdiopathic pleural effusions that have been sampled by thoracentesis are ideal for medical thoracoscopy. The direct visualization of the pleura allows for site-directed biopsy of abnormal parietal pleura. Additionally, it allows for examination of the visceral pleura and any clues that may lead to the diagnosis of the pleural effusion. Most interventional pulmonologists limit biopsy to the parietal pleura due to the risk for injury to the lung when sampling the visceral pleura.\n\nCytologic examination of pleural fluid is diagnostic in only 60-80% of patients with metastatic pleural involvement and in less than 20% in patients with mesothelioma.\n [3] In cases for which the initial evaluation of a pleural effusion is nondiagnostic and malignancy is suspected, medical thoracoscopy and parietal pleural biopsy should be considered.\n [4] Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy establishes a diagnosis in more than 90% of the cases.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiopsy forceps sampling parietal pleura. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nMalignant pleural effusion/pleurodesis\n\nIn cases with an established malignant diagnosis, medical thoracoscopy also has a therapeutic role in the form of pleurodesis.\n [6] Complete evacuation of pleural fluid, with maximization of lung expandability by removing adhesions and pleurodesis by talc insufflations has short- and long-term success rates greater than 90%.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalc pleurodesis on lung and parietal pleura. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe benefits of pleurodesis include improvement of functional status as well as improving the quality of life, especially for patients with advanced malignant disease. In patients who are undergoing further treatment for malignancy, improving the functional status may allow for increased treatment options overall.\n\nIn addition, patients who do require further treatment can be excluded from certain chemotherapeutics because of chemotherapeutic tendency to distribute into the pleural effusion and affect serum levels. The classic examples of this are methotrexate, fludarabine, and possibly pemetrexed.\n [7, 8, 9] \n\nSurvival of patients with advanced pleural disease is often limited, from weeks to months. The benefits of medical thoracoscopy versus repeated thoracentesis should be carefully considered for the individual patient.\n\nLung cancer\n\nIn the patient with known lung cancer and an effusion with a negative cytology, medical thoracoscopy is an excellent tool. It allows for direct visualization of the pleura and a thorough examination for evidence of metastasis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBulky metastasis on parietal pleura. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamination for evidence of metastasis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe sensitivity of pleuroscopy-guided biopsy in malignant pleural effusions is 95%, compared with 62% for cytology from thoracentesis and 44% for closed pleural biopsy.\n [10] By allowing for a more accurate diagnosis and staging, unnecessary procedures may be prevented on a patient who is inappropriately categorized into a lower stage.\n\nMalignant mesothelioma\n\nThe yield of cytology for malignant mesothelioma is even lower than most malignant effusions, as low as 41% in one study.\n [11] It can be difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis without complete visualization of the pleural space. Medical thoracoscopy is favored over thoracotomy for two reasons. First, the pleural specimen obtained with the minimally invasive 5-mm forceps is comparable to the specimen achieved with open biopsies. Second, the site-directed nature of pleural biopsies through the semirigid pleuroscope allows for a minimally invasive approach.\n\nTuberculous pleural effusion\n\nThere is controversy regarding if medical thoracoscopy is warranted when the suspicion for tuberculosis is high. In these cases, the diagnostic yield from closed-needle pleural biopsy is approximately 69%, with some studies reporting rates as high as 88%.\n [5] The consensus is that medical thoracoscopy should be reserved for special circumstances, such as lysis of adhesions or more effective drainage of loculated effusions, as well as when larger quantities of tissue are needed for sensitivities.\n [5] \n\nRecurrent pleural effusions of benign origin\n\nRecurrent pleural effusions are often caused by heart failure, cardiac surgery, nephritic syndrome, connective tissue diseases, and other inflammatory disorders. When these effusions are not well controlled by repeat large-volume thoracentesis, pleural biopsies can be obtained through medical thoracoscopy, and pleurodesis can be performed if necessary.\n\nEmpyema and complicated parapneumonic effusions\n\nSome interventional pulmonologists have used medical thoracoscopy for drainage of uncomplicated empyema and chest tube placement. Additionally, it can be used carefully for lysis of thin fibrous adhesions.\n [12] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPleural adhesions on medical thoracoscopy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nCurrently, this is not routinely performed or the standard of care, mainly because timing is key in these procedures and they should be considered early if chest tube drainage is inadequate.\n [5, 13] In later stages of the empyema, there may be thick fibrous adhesions, pleural peel, or trapped lung. In these cases, video-assisted thoracoscopic decortication is required for treatment.\n [14, 15] \n\nPneumothorax\n\nMedical thoracoscopy can offer definitive treatment or diagnostic inspection of a patient with a recurrent pneumothorax. In patients who are not candidates for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, pleural abrasion or talc pleurodesis can be performed. For patients suitable for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, bullectomy, pleural abrasion, and pleurectomy in the operating room are superior and preferred.\n [15] \n\nContraindications\nThe major contraindications are related to the ability to perform the procedure. As long as no contraindication exists for the ability to insert instruments into the pleural space, it can be performed safely. Even when the lung is adherent to the chest wall, the use of transthoracic ultrasound by interventional pulmonologists can allow identification of safe areas to insert the trocar and pleuroscope.\n\nA pleural separation of at least 10 mm is recommended to minimize injury to the lung. In patients with small effusions, a pneumothorax may need to be induced by cannulating the pleural space and asking the patient to inspire deeply while the catheter is open to the atmosphere. The presence of a pneumothorax can then be confirmed with either chest radiograph or thoracic ultrasound at the bedside. This procedure is limited by the ability of the patient to tolerate a pneumothorax. In patients who already have an effusion, the concern regarding tolerance of a pneumothorax is not as worrisome because an equal volume of fluid would be replaced by air.\n\nThe following relative contraindications may be corrected and accounted for:\n\n\n\n\n\nRefractory cough\n\n\n\n\nHypoxia\n\n\n\n\nCoagulopathy\n\n\n\n\nThrombocytopenia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Noninvasive Ventilation": "\nOverview\n\n\nNoninvasive ventilation (NIV) refers to the administration of ventilatory support without using an invasive artificial airway (endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube). The use of noninvasive ventilation (see the video below) has markedly increased over the past two decades, and noninvasive ventilation has now become an integral tool in the management of both acute and chronic respiratory failure, in both the home setting and in the critical care unit. Noninvasive ventilation has been used as a replacement for invasive ventilation, and its flexibility also allows it to be a valuable complement in patient management. Its use in acute respiratory failure is well accepted and widespread. It is the focus of this review. The role of noninvasive ventilation in those with chronic respiratory failure is not as clear and remains to be defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoninvasive ventilation. Courtesy of Therese Canares, MD, and Jonathan Valente, MD, Rhode Island Hospital, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nHistorical background\nAn interest in the methods of artificial respiration has long persisted, stimulated by attempts at resuscitation of drowning victims. Reports dating from the mid 1700s document a bellows-type device being the most commonly used form of respiratory assistance. Negative-pressure tank-type ventilators came into use in the next century, with a prototype developed by Dalziel in 1832. This spawned a variety of cuirass and tank negative-pressure ventilators, with the general principle of enclosing the thorax, creating negative pressure to passively expand the chest wall and lungs. This led to the Drinker-Shaw iron lung in 1928, which was the first widely used negative-pressure ventilator. In 1931, Emerson modified these large devices, and the Emerson tank ventilator became the standard for ventilatory support. The Emerson tank ventilator was especially crucial in the treatment of poliomyelitis victims.\n\n\n\n\nRudimentary devices that provided continuous positive airway pressure were described in the 1930s, but the negative-pressure ventilators were the predominant method of ventilatory support until the polio epidemics overwhelmed their capacity in the 1950s. Development of positive-pressure valves delivered through tracheostomy tubes permitted the delivery of intermittent positive pressure during inspiration. This quickly replaced the negative-pressure ventilators, further supported by the development of the cuffed endotracheal tube and bedside ventilators. However, positive-pressure ventilation delivered through either a translaryngeal endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube was also associated with a host of complications, specifically injury to the larynx and trachea, as well as other issues involving the timing of extubation, preservation of speech, and the ability to continue swallowing.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1980s, increasing experience with positive-pressure ventilation delivered through a mask in patients with obstructive sleep apnea led to this type of ventilatory support, initially in patients with neuromuscular respiratory failure. Success led to its adoption in other conditions, and noninvasive ventilation became especially promising in the treatment of patients with decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

        "Noninvasive Ventilation Procedures": "\nBackground\n\n\nNoninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be defined as a ventilation modality that supports breathing by delivering mechanically assisted breaths without the need for intubation or surgical airway.\n [1] It is a popular method of adult respiratory management in both the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care unit (ICU), and it is increasingly used in the care of pediatric patients.\n [2]  Besides avoiding the adverse effects of invasive ventilation, NIV has the added advantage of patient comfort. It has become an important mechanism of ventilator support both inside and outside the ICU.\n [3, 4, 5] \nNIV is divided into two main types, negative-pressure ventilation (NPV) and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV); the latter is further subdivided into several subtypes, including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and volume-assured pressure support (VAPS). This article addresses these methods and briefly discusses heliox adjunct therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Nuss Procedure for Pectus Excavatum": "\nBackground\n\n\nPectus excavatum, also known as sunken or funnel chest, is a congenital chest-wall malformation in which several ribs and the sternum grow abnormally, producing a concave or caved-in appearance of the anterior chest wall and sternum. (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical appearance of (A) teenaged boy with severe pectus excavatum and (B) young girl with pectus deformity.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nPectus excavatum occurs in an estimated one in 300-500 births, with a 3:1 male predominance. The condition is typically noticed at birth, and more than two thirds of cases are diagnosed within the first year of life. Worsening of the chest’s appearance and the onset of symptoms are usually reported during rapid bone growth seen in puberty and early teenage years.\n [1] Many patients are not brought to the attention of a pediatric surgeon until the patient and the family have noticed such changes. Despite the lack of an identifiable genetic marker, the familial occurrence of pectus deformity is reported in 35% of cases.\n [2] \nThis topic focuses on the operative technique known as minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). It was originally described by Donald Nuss and thus is also known as the Nuss technique or pectus bar procedure. Nuss performed the first minimally invasive operation for the correction of pectus excavatum in the 1980s, but it was not until 1997 that this innovative technique was introduced to the American Pediatric Surgical Association and subsequently published in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nBecause of the early excellent results of the Nuss procedure and because of its less radical nature (as compared with the open Ravitch technique),\n [4, 5, 6, 7] the popularity of this operation has grown dramatically.\n [8]  (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuss procedure.

        "Open Pleural Drainage": "\nBackground\n\n\nOpen pleural drainage is an uncommon modality in the current era of appropriate antibiotic coverage and multiple means of closed pleural drainage. It is usually reserved for very ill patients for whom thoracoscopy or thoracotomy would be too morbid.\n [1, 2] In its extreme form, open pleural drainage results in a thoracoplasty\n [3] by removing ribs from the chest wall, which brings the chest wall to the lung and achieves obliteration of an empty space.\nIn the preantibiotic era, pleural infections were a challenging entity, with many complications and difficult management. At that time, open pleural drainage was an important treatment of chronic empyemas. Because of advances in medical technology, including radiographic imaging and antibiotics, today most pleural infections are successfully treated with closed suction drainage or video-assisted thoracoscopy.\n [4, 5] However, in view of the historical importance of open pleural drainage, it is worthwhile to review the indications for and techniques of this operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate Measurement": "\nBackground\n\n\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is the maximum flow rate (expressed in liters per minute [L/min]) generated during a forceful exhalation, starting from full inspiration.\n [1] PEFR primarily reflects large airway flow and depends on the lung recoil, voluntary effort, and muscular strength of the patient.\nMaximal airflow occurs during the effort-dependent portion of the expiratory maneuver; thus, low values may be caused by a less than maximal effort rather than by airway obstruction. However, PEFR is variable among individuals with a similar body build; such variation has to do with airway size versus lung size. Nevertheless, the ease of measuring PEFR with an inexpensive small portable device has made it popular as a means of following the degree of airway obstruction in patients with asthma and other pulmonary conditions.\n\n\nForced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV1) is a dynamic measure of flow used in formal spirometry. It represents a truer indication of airway obstruction than does PEFR. Although PEFR usually correlates well with FEV1, this correlation decreases in patients with asthma as airflow diminishes.\n [2] \nPEFR monitoring can be accurately performed by most patients older than 5 years. It is most commonly measured by a portable flow gauge device (peak flow meter [PFM]) but may also be obtained by a transducer that converts flow to electric output during spirometry (pneumotachometer).\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nThe most frequent use of PEFR measurement is in home monitoring of asthma, where it can be beneficial in patients for both short- and long-term monitoring. When properly performed and interpreted, PEFR measurement can provide the patient and the clinician with objective data on which to base therapeutic decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Percutaneous Transtracheal Jet Ventilation": "\nBackground\n\n\nAirway management is a priority in the resuscitation of critically ill patients. Generally, this can be achieved by means of basic or advanced airway maneuvers. As a bridge to a definitive airway, supraglottic devices such as a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or a King laryngeal tube (LT) can be employed. In a minority of patients, tracheal intubation fails, and a surgical airway is required in order to secure the airway.\n [1] This group includes patients with upper-airway foreign bodies or neoplasms, maxillofacial trauma, laryngeal edema, or infection.\nA surgical airway can be obtained in the emergency setting through one of the following two principal methods\n [1, 2] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Open surgical \n          cricothyroidotomy\n\n\n\n\n          Needle cricothyroidotomy\n         \n\n\n\nNeedle cricothyroidotomy has commonly been held to provide simpler, faster, and safer access,\n [2, 3]  though open cricothyroidotomy has been gaining favor.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nPercutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation (PTJV) was introduced in the 1950s by Flory et al.\n [5] In the early 1970s, intermittent PTJV was successfully used for airway management during routine general surgical procedures lasting up to 2 hours. PTJV was also advocated as an alternative in the management of the difficult airway, in conjunction with laryngoscopy.\n [5] \nSome reports have recommended PTJV only as a transient resuscitative measure for emergencies in which endotracheal intubation or other ventilation methods are not feasible.\n [6, 7] PTJV is widely thought of as a temporizing procedure to be maintained for 30 minutes at most. However, animal experiments and clinical studies have demonstrated that transtracheal ventilation is an effective, quick, fairly simple, and safe way to obtain and maintain an airway for a prolonged period.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\nAt first, PTJV was not widely accepted, because of initial reports of high complication rates.\n [3, 9] It was also noted that PTJV does not provide definitive airway protection against copious secretions or aspiration.\n\nNevertheless, in a life-threatening situation where tracheal intubation and bag-mask-valve ventilation cannot be performed to restore adequate gas exchange during acute respiratory failure, it is reasonable to consider PTJV as a viable interim maneuver. Under such circumstances, PTJV with a large-bore needle provides immediate oxygenation and ventilation by providing adequate gas exchange and ensuring the patency of the airway until a definitive procedure (eg, oral intubation with bronchoscopy followed by surgical tracheostomy) can be performed\n [10] ; it requires fewer instruments than surgical cricothyroidotomy and can be performed more quickly.\n\nTranstracheal jet ventilation has been used extensively as a means of ventilation during surgery and procedures of the upper airway.\n [11, 12, 13]  It may be used even with partial airway obstruction.\n [14] PTJV can force oropharyngeal secretions out of the proximal trachea and may force a foreign body out of the proximal trachea (in cases of partial airway obstruction). However, upper-airway patency is required for exhalation during PTJV, and an open cricothyroidotomy is preferred if significant obstruction exists.\n\nPTJV is a rapid means for obtaining airway control in both elective and emergency situations for patients of all ages and in many clinical situations.\n [15, 16, 17] It is the surgical airway of choice for children younger than 12 years because of the small tracheal diameter, which often renders an open cricothyroidotomy impossible. Although rarely performed, needle cricothyroidotomy is a potentially life-saving procedure.\n\nThe range of adapted equipment presently used for needle cricothyroidotomy is diverse. This article describes and demonstrates a method of PTJV and oxygen delivery for needle cricothyroidotomy that is easily accessible, simple to assemble, easy to use, and readily available in every emergency setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pleural Biopsy": "\nOverview\n\n\nPleural diseases involve the parietal and visceral pleura and may be of infectious, inflammatory, or malignant origin, often resulting in pleural effusions. The diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions should include pertinent history, clinical course, and radiographic abnormalities and take into account the patient’s desire to pursue aggressive workup. Initial evaluation begins with a thoracentesis and characterization of the fluid as a transudate or exudate, its appearance, turbidity, and even odor (ie, urinothorax). Further analysis includes chemical, microbiological, cytological, and disease-specific analyses depending on the suspected etiology. Transudative pleural fluid is misclassified as an exudate in up to 25% of cases.\n [1] In order to reduce misclassification, special attention should be paid to the serum-to-pleural protein and serum-to-pleural albumin differences. Differences of more than 3.1 g/dL and more than 1.2 g/dL, respectively, indicate a transudate.\n [1] Rarely, neoplastic pleural diseases can present as a transudate.\n [1] However, 40% of pleural effusions remain undiagnosed after an initial thoracentesis.\n [2, 3] \nPrimary pleural malignancies tend to originate from the parietal pleura and spread to the visceral pleura, while metastatic disease (ie, bronchogenic carcinoma) starts on the visceral pleura and spreads to the parietal pleura.\n [4, 5] Contrast-enhanced CT scanning of the thorax is indicated for an undiagnosed exudative effusion to assess for parenchymal abnormalities and the extent of pleural involvement.\n [6] Subsequent pleural biopsy is indicated to evaluate and exclude infectious and malignant etiologies, particularly malignant mesothelioma.\n [7, 6] Connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid disease can also present with pleural involvement, requiring pleural biopsy for diagnosis. In addition, pleural thickening in the absence of pleural effusion may require further histological evaluation. Despite extensive workup, the etiology of pleural effusion remains unclear in nearly 20%-25% of cases.\n [7, 8] \n\n\nKarpathiou et al performed a retrospective analysis of 100 cases of nonspecific pleuritis attributed to benign etiologies and proposed a histopathologic scoring system to further characterize the underlying disease state. The semiquantitative scores were based on the degrees of inflammation, fibrosis, vascular proliferation, hemorrhage, fibrin, edema, and mesothelial hyperplasia on pleural biopsy. The highest overall scores were associated with bacterial and autoimmune diseases, followed by drugs and viruses, while the lowest scores were associated with pneumothorax and cardiac etiologies. Higher degrees of fibrosis and vascular proliferation were associated with bacterial etiologies. The authors propose that the scoring system and patterns seen histologically may assist with identification of the underlying etiology.\n [9] \nOnce pleural biopsy is indicated, various biopsy techniques are available to diagnose pleural disease. These range from older techniques, such as “blind” or closed pleural biopsy, to image-guided and thoracoscopic biopsy. The latter techniques have higher diagnostic yield and provide better diagnostic sensitivity. In addition, the use of immunohistochemistry provides increased diagnostic accuracy.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

This procedure helps to prevent fluid from collecting in the affected area and is used for the treatment of mesothelioma, a pleural mesothelial cancer.\n [1] Pleurectomy provides symptomatic relief but does not appear to benefit survival rates.\nMalignant pleural effusions generally result from metastatic spread of disease to the pleura and are commonly seen in the course of many tumors. Less frequently, effusions are associated with primary tumors of lung, pleura, or mediastinum.\n\n\nMany nonsurgical methods have been proposed to control effusion and to improve respiratory function. Nonetheless, many studies have demonstrated the benefits of pleurectomy in patients with malignant effusions secondary to various cancers.\n [2] \nPleurectomy reduces the risk of symptomatic pleural effusions and recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Plication of the Diaphragm": "\nBackground\n\n\nPlication of the diaphragm is a surgical procedure that has been performed since the 1920s for the treatment of diaphragmatic paralysis.\n [1] Diaphragmatic paralysis is a serious problem for individuals suffering from the respiratory abnormalities, reduced energy levels, and sleep disturbances that are commonly associated with the disorder. The inability of the lung to expand fully in patients with diaphragmatic paralysis also makes these individuals more susceptible to pleural effusions, pneumonia, and atelectasis.\nThe goal of diaphragm plication is to flatten the dome of the diaphragm, providing the lung with greater volume for expansion. Since its original description, diaphragm plication has been performed with numerous modifications, including the minimally invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) approach.\n [2, 3] Laparoscopic robot-assisted diaphragm plication has also been reported.\n [4] Diaphragm plication surgery using both transabdominal and transthoracic approaches has been performed in both children and adults.\n\n\nAlternatives to diaphragm plication for the successful treatment of diaphragmatic paralysis include diaphragm pacing and phrenic nerve grafting.\n [5] Recently, there has been progress in the area of phrenic nerve surgery, which repairs injuries to the phrenic nerve using nerve grafts or nerve transfers.\n [6, 7] Alternatively, patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis from spinal cord injury may be better served with a diaphragm pacemaker to restore function to the diaphragm. Patients with diaphragmatic paralysis now have options for treatment, including both phrenic nerve grafting and diaphragm plication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Thus, the lungs are susceptible to a wide variety of pathologic conditions, both malignant and benign, that may require pneumonectomy (complete resection of a lung).\n [1, 2] \nExtrapleural pneumonectomy is an expanded procedure that includes resection of the parietal and visceral pleurae, diseased lung, ipsilateral hemi-diaphragm, ipsilateral pericardium, and mediastinal lymph nodes.\n [3, 4]  Although the procedure carries a risk for morbidity, including cardiac and pulmonary complications, it can be beneficial in patients with malignant mesothelioma and extensive thymomas.\n [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] This surgical approach often is coupled with radiation and chemotherapy to improve survival in both diseases.\n [2, 5, 7, 8] \n\n\nSarot described the first extrapleural pneumonectomy in 1949,\n [1] and it was initially used in the treatment of tuberculosis empyema, but became more commonly used in the 1980s and 1990s in the treatment of mesothelioma.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pulmonary Function Testing": "\nSpirometry\n\n\nDescription\nSpirometry assesses the integrated mechanical function of the lung, chest wall, respiratory muscles, and airways by measuring the total volume of air exhaled from a full lung (total lung capacity [TLC]) to maximal expiration (residual volume [RV]). This volume, the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the forced expiratory volume in the first second of the forceful exhalation (FEV1), should be repeatable to within 0.15 L upon repeat efforts in the same measurement unless the largest value for either parameter is less than 1 L. In this case, the expected repeatability is to within 0.1 L of the largest value. The patient is instructed to inhale as much as possible and then exhale rapidly and forcefully for as long as flow can be maintained. The patient should exhale until one of the criteria defining the end of a forced exhalation has been reached. At the end of the forced exhalation, the patient should again inhale fully as rapidly as possible. The FVC should then be compared with that inhaled volume to verify that the forced expiratory maneuver did start from full inflation.\n\n\nReduction in FEV1 may reflect reduction in the maximum inflation of the lungs (TLC); obstruction of the airways; respiratory muscle weakness; or submaximal expiratory force due to poor coaching, poor understanding, or malingering. Airway obstruction is the most common cause of reduction in FEV1. Airway obstruction may be secondary to bronchospasm, airway inflammation, loss of lung elastic recoil, increased secretions in the airway, or any combination of these causes. Response of FEV1 to inhaled bronchodilators is used to assess the reversibility of airway obstruction, although it is now widely appreciated that a response showing a lack of a significant increase in FEV1 does not indicate the patient will not benefit clinically from bronchodilator therapy. A significant increase in the inspiratory capacity (IC) and/or vital capacity (VC) after bronchodilator therapy can occur even when the FEV1 fails to show a significant change.\n [1] \nThe standards used to describe the quality of spirometry measurements are from the Standardization of Spirometry 2019 Update.\n [2]  This document provides examples of the most common technical problems associated with spirometry testing. See Standardization of Spirometry 2019 Update. An Official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society Technical Statement for more information.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nSpirometry is used to establish baseline lung function, evaluate dyspnea, detect pulmonary disease, monitor effects of therapies used to treat respiratory disease, evaluate respiratory impairment or disability, evaluate operative risk, and perform surveillance for occupational-related lung disease. It may also be used in research and clinical trials and epidemiological surveys.\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nRelative contraindications (no absolute contraindications) for spirometry are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Conditions that may be negatively impacted by the increases in myocardial demand or changes in blood pressure associated with spirometry: These include recent (< 1 week) myocardial infarction, systemic hypotension or severe hypertension, significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmia, noncompensated heart failure, uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension, acute cor pulmonale, clinically unstable pulmonary embolism, and a history of syncope associated with forced exhalation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Conditions that may be negatively impacted by the increase in intracranial/intraocular pressure associated with spirometry: These include cerebral aneurysm, recent (< 4 weeks) brain surgery, recent concussion with continuing symptoms, and recent (within 1 week) eye surgery.\n         \n\n\n\n          Conditions that may be negatively impacted by increased sinus and middle ear pressures: Examples include recent (< 1 week) sinus or middle ear surgery or infections.\n         \n\n\n\n          Conditions that may be negatively impacted by increased intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures: Examples include the presence of pneumothorax, recent (< 4 weeks) thoracic or abdominal surgery, and late-term pregnancy.\n         \n\n\n\n          Infection control issues, including active or suspected transmissible respiratory or systemic infections including tuberculosis, or physical conditions predisposing to transmission of infections such as hemoptysis, significant secretions or oral lesions or bleeding\n         \n\n\nPatient care/preparations\nTwo choices are available with respect to bronchodilator and medication use prior to testing. Patients may withhold oral and inhaled bronchodilators to establish baseline lung function and evaluate maximum bronchodilator response, or they may continue taking medication as prescribed. If medications are withheld, a risk of exacerbation of bronchial spasm exists.\n\nInterpretation\nInterpretation of spirometry results should begin with an assessment of test quality. Failure to meet performance standards can result in unreliable test results (see the image below). The American Thoracic Society (ATS) defines acceptable spirometry as an expiratory effort that has the following characteristics:\n\nPulmonary function tests require patients to successfully perform respiratory maneuvers in a standardized manner in order to obtain clinically meaningful results. Spirometry is perhaps the most technically and physically demanding. The patient is required to inhale as fully as possible, exhale with as much force as possible, and continue their expiratory effort until they empty their lungs as completely as possible or are unable to continue.\n\nThe performance standards for acceptable spirometry are summarized below. The comments of the technologist administering the test can assist the interpreting physician in determining if results of a testing session that fail to meet some of the standards can still provide clinically useful data.\n\n \n\n\n\nTable 1.

Readers are directed to Spirometry Quality Assurance: Common Errors and Their Impact on Test Results. A booklet can also be obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services. It provides examples of common spirometry performance errors and their impact on test results.\n\nIn patients that have significant loss of lung elastic recoil (pulmonary emphysema, COPD), spirometry may show negative effort dependence of forced expiratory flow. The effort that has the highest peak expiratory effort may produce a lower FEV1 because of the dynamic compression of the airways that results from the loss of elastic recoil support of airways that is characteristic of emphysema. In this circumstance, reporting the highest FEV1 coming from an effort with submaximal expiratory effort can lead to confusing results, particularly if a setting of assessing spirometric response to bronchodilators. Although not yet a spirometry acceptability standard, it appears that when reporting the FEV1 considering only efforts that have a time to peak flow (TPEF) less than or equal to 0.12 seconds helps eliminate this effect. This parameter can be displayed on most laboratory-based spirometry testing systems. \n\nInspection of the volume-time tracing aids in identification of early termination of expiration by evaluating the presence of an expiratory plateau. In the absence of an expiratory plateau, a 15-second expiratory time ensures the quality of the FVC. Inspection of the start of the volume-time tracing can help identify a hesitant start, which can result in a falsely low FEV1. Repeatability of the FVC and the FEV1 helps ensure that the results truly represent the patient's lung function. Attention should be focused on the repeatability of two key parameters: FVC and FEV1. It should be noted that while repeatability of the FVC and FEV1 strengthens the confidence that the forced exhalations started from full inflation, it is possible to demonstrate repeatability of these parameters even when forced exhalations start from a lung volume below full inflation. Demonstration that the difference between the largest FIVC and the FVC is no more than the larger of 0.100 L or 5% of the largest FIVC is a key acceptability criterion.\n\nThe reference equations published in 2012 by the Global Lung Initiative (GLI), a Task Force of the European Respiratory Society, provide normative values for males and females from age 3 to 95 years across a wide range of ethnicities,\n [3] and these should be used as the default set of reference values for spirometry. The use of these predicted values for spirometry has been supported globally, including endorsements from the European Respiratory Society, the ATS, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Australian and New Zealand Society of Respiratory Science, and the Asian Pacific Society for Respirology. The report is in accordance with the previously published recommendations of the ATS that called for the elimination of a fixed percent of predicted cut point to determine normality and a fixed lower limit of normal of the FEV1/FVC ratio to identify airway obstruction, both of which have been shown to result in significant misclassification of spirometry results.\n [2] Guidelines for a standardized report format have been published and should be the default report format. The use of Z scores to determine severity of spirometric abnormalities is encouraged.\n\nAbnormalities can be classified by the physiologic patterns outlined below.\n\nObstructive defects\nDisproportionate reduction in the FEV1 as compared with the FVC is reflected in the FEV1/FVC ratio and is the hallmark of obstructive lung diseases. This physiologic category of lung diseases includes but is not limited to asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiolitis. The forced expiratory flow at any given lung volume is reduced. The mechanism responsible for the reduction in airflow can be bronchial spasm, airway inflammation, increased intraluminal secretions, and/or reduction in parenchymal support of the airways due to loss of lung elastic recoil. Poor understanding and effort on the part of the patient is also a cause for reduced flows, and the diagnosis of airway obstruction should be limited to measurements composed of acceptable efforts demonstrating repeatability of FVC and FEV1.\n\nThe use of a fixed lower limit of normal for the FEV1/FVC ratio as proposed by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lacks a scientific basis and results in significant misclassification of patients at either end of the age spectrum. Young patients are classified as \"normal\" when airflow obstruction is present, and older patients are classified as showing obstruction when no airflow obstruction is present. The use of the GOLD threshold for identifying airway obstruction should be discouraged in clinical practice where or when computerized predicted values are available.\n\nThe recommended practice for identifying a spirometric abnormality is to use the predicted lower limit of normal for that individual based on the sex, age, height, and ethnicity. The GLI reference equations provide lower limits of normal for spirometric parameters.\n\nAssessment of reversibility of airway obstruction\nWhen airway obstruction is identified on spirometry, assessing response to inhaled bronchodilators is useful. The ATS has recommended that the threshold for significant response be demonstration of an increase of at least 12% and 0.2 L in either FVC (provided the expiratory time for both sessions agree within 10%) or FEV1 on a spirogram performed 10-15 minutes after inhalation of a therapeutic dose of a bronchodilating agent. New standards recommend the use of four inhalations (100 mcg each, 400 mcg total dose) of albuterol administered through a valved spacer device. When concern about tremor or heart rate exists, lower doses may be used. Response to an anticholinergic drug may be assessed 30 minutes after four inhalations (40 mcg each, 160 mcg total dose) of ipratropium bromide. Failure to respond to bronchodilator challenge does not preclude clinical benefit from bronchodilators. A positive response to the bronchodilators may correlate with response to steroid therapy.\n\nRestrictive defects\nReduction in the FVC with a normal or elevated FEV1-to-FVC ratio should trigger further evaluation of total lung capacity (TLC) to rule out restrictive lung disease. Measuring the TLC and residual volume (RV) can confirm restriction suggested by spirometry (see Lung Volume Determination below). See the chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a graph of lung volumes in health and in disease, showing the various lung subdivisions. Normal aging results in an increase in functional reserve capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) and a normal total lung capacity (TLC) percentage. Obstructive lung diseases cause hyperinflation (increase in RV and FRC) with a relatively normal forced vital capacity (FVC). In severe emphysema, the TLC percentage can exceed 150%, with the RV impinging on the FVC. Restrictive lung diseases exhibit reduced TLC percentage with relative preservation of the RV/TLC percentage in fibrosis, a reduced inspiratory capacity and expiratory reserve volume (ERV) in neuromuscular disease, and severe reduction of the ERV in extreme obesity. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nQuantification of impairment by spirometry\nIn normal spirometry, FVC, FEV1, and FEV1 -to-FVC ratio are above the lower limit of normal. The lower limit of normal is defined as the result of the mean predicted value (based on the patient's sex, age, and height) minus 1.64 times the standard error of the estimate from the population study on which the reference equation is based. If the lower limit of normal is not available, the FVC and FEV1 should be greater than or equal to 80% of predicted, and the FEV1 -to-FVC ratio should be no more than 8-9 absolute percentage points below the predicted ratio. The ATS has recommended the use of lower limits of normal instead of the 80% of predicted for setting the threshold that defines abnormal test results.\n\nA reduced FVC on spirometry in the absence of a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio suggests a restrictive ventilatory problem. An inappropriately shortened exhalation during spirometry can (and often does) result in an artifactually reduced FVC. Causes of restriction on spirometry include obesity, cardiomegaly, ascites, pregnancy, pleural effusion, pleural tumors, kyphoscoliosis, pulmonary fibrosis, neuromuscular disease, diaphragm weakness or paralysis, space-occupying lesions, lung resection, congestive heart failure, inadequate inspiration or expiration secondary to pain, and severe obstructive lung disease. One scheme for describing the severity of reductions in the FVC and/or the FEV1 is shown below: \n\n\n\n\n\nMild - Greater than 70% of predicted\n\n\n\n\nModerate - 60-69% of predicted\n\n\n\n\nModerately severe - 50-59%\n\n\n\n\nSevere - 35-49% of predicted\n\n\n\n\nVery severe - Less than 35% of predicted\n\n\n\nThe lower limit of normal for the FEF25-75% can be less than 50% of the mean predicted value, making it important to use the lower limit of normal defined by the 95% confidence limit of the mean predicted value rather than a threshold defined by a fixed percentage of the predicted value. The FEF25-75% is also very dependent on expiratory time. If expiratory times of spirometry efforts vary by more than 10%, comparisons of the FEF25-75% before and after bronchodilator challenge are difficult to interpret. Early termination of expiration shifts the middle 50% of the exhaled volume toward the start of the exhalation, artifactually raising the FEF25-75%. For these reasons, the use of the FEF25-75% to assess airway function in adults is discouraged.\n\nThe FVC is a reliable means of assessing the clinical status in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A minimum clinically important difference of the FVC, expressed as a percentage of the mean predicted normal value, of 2-6% of has been established. This obviates the need to obtain a total lung capacity (TLC) measurement to assess disease progression or the effects of medical therapy.\n\nSpecial assessments\nSitting versus supine vital capacity\n\nEvaluation of diaphragm strength can be accomplished by measuring the vital capacity in an upright or sitting position followed by a measurement made in the supine position. A reduction in the vital capacity to less than 90% of the upright vital capacity suggests diaphragm weakness or paralysis. Interpreting an increased reduction in vital capacity in the supine position as diaphragm dysfunction should be made cautiously if the patient's body mass index is greater than 45 kg/m2.\n [4] Studies reporting the normal reduction of the vital capacity of less than 10% from upright to supine were conducted with individuals who were not obese. Slightly greater reductions in obese individuals in a supine position may not indicate diaphragm dysfunction, but rather an increase in the resistive forces against which the diaphragm descends. Reductions in the supine vital capacity more than 20% of baseline indicate hemidiaphragm or diaphragm dysfunction or paralysis.\n\nIdentifying central airway obstructions\n\nThe configuration of the flow-volume curve of a properly performed spirometry test can be used to demonstrate various abnormalities of the larger central airways (larynx, trachea, right and left mainstem bronchi). Three patterns of flow-volume abnormalities can be detected: (1) variable intrathoracic obstructions, (2) variable extrathoracic obstructions, and (3) fixed upper airway obstructions. Reproducing these findings on every effort is important because spurious nonreproducible reductions in inspiratory flow are not uncommon after completion of forced expirations in subjects without upper airway obstruction. Examples of variable intrathoracic obstruction include localized tumors of the lower trachea or mainstem bronchus, tracheomalacia, and airway changes associated with polychondritis.\n\nVariable upper airway obstructions demonstrate flow reductions that vary with the phase of forced respirations. Variable intrathoracic obstructions demonstrate reduction of airflow during forced expirations with preservation of a normal inspiratory flow configuration. This is observed as a plateau across a broad volume range on the expired flow limb of the flow-volume curve. The reduction in airflow results from a narrowing of the airway inside the thorax, in part because of a narrowing or collapse of the airway secondary to extraluminal pressures exceeding intraluminal pressures during expiration.\n\nVariable extrathoracic obstructions demonstrate reduction of inspired flows during forced inspirations with preservation of expiratory flows. Again, the major cause of the reduced flow during inspiration is airway narrowing secondary to extraluminal pressures exceeding intraluminal pressures during inspiration. Causes of this type of upper airway obstruction include unilateral and bilateral vocal cord paralysis, vocal cord adhesions, vocal cord constriction, laryngeal edema, and upper airway narrowing associated with obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nFixed upper airway obstructions demonstrate plateaus of flow during both forced inspiration and forced expiration. Causes of fixed upper airway obstruction include goiters, endotracheal neoplasms, stenosis of both main bronchi, postintubation stenosis, and performance of the test through a tracheostomy tube or other fixed orifice device. (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow reduction must be consistent on every effort to be considered actual flow limitation. Fixed upper airway obstruction may be caused by postintubation stenosis, goiter, endotracheal neoplasms, and bronchial stenosis. Variable intrathoracic obstruction may be caused by tracheomalacia, polychondritis, and tumors of the lower trachea or main bronchus. Variable extrathoracic obstruction may be caused by bilateral and unilateral vocal cord paralysis, vocal cord constriction, reduced pharyngeal cross-sectional area, and airway burns. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAssessment of operative risk\nWhile no single test can effectively predict intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality from pulmonary complications, the FEV1 obtained from good quality spirometry is a useful tool. When the FEV1 is greater than 2 L or 50% of predicted, major complications are rare.\n\nOperative risk is heavily dependent on the surgical site, with chest surgery having the highest risk for postoperative complications, followed by upper and lower abdominal sites. Patient-related factors associated with increased operative risk for pulmonary complications include preexisting pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, dyspnea upon exertion, heavy smoking history, respiratory infection, cough (particularly productive cough), advanced age (>70 y), malnutrition, general debilitation, obesity, and prolonged surgery.\n\nAssessment for lung surgery typically involves prediction of a postoperative FEV1 by using the preoperative FEV1. In a borderline case, consideration of the contribution of the remaining portions can be assessed by a perfusion scan. The relative percentage of perfusion (Q) of the remaining lung or lung segments usually is proportional to its contribution to ventilation and can be used to estimate postoperative function as shown in the following equation:\n\n\nPostoperative FEV1 = Preoperative FEV1 × Q% of the remaining lung\n\n\nFor example, if the preoperative FEV1 is 1.6 L and the lung to be resected demonstrates 40% perfusion, the postoperative FEV1 would be 1.6 × 0.6 = 0.96 L. An estimated postoperative FEV1 of less than 0.8 L often is associated with chronic respiratory failure and may indicate an unacceptable degree of operative risk. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing may help evaluate operative risk in patients who have a preoperative FEV1 below 2 L or 50% of predicted.\n\nThe algorithm for clearance of candidates for lung resection proposed by Bolinger and Perruchoud\n [5] has been successfully evaluated in 137 consecutive patients who were referred for resection by Wyser et al\n [6] with an overall mortality of 1.5% and is detailed in Cardiopulmonary Stress Testing. Patients with a negative cardiac history and ECG that demonstrate an FEV1 and a diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) that are greater than 80% of predicted are judged to be able to undergo pneumonectomy safely.\n\nTechnical considerations\nThe ATS has published guidelines for a standardized technique that includes spirometer performance standards. A reasonable end-point for the maneuver in the absence of true flow cessation (ie, airway obstruction is present) is 15 seconds. Patients often discontinue the forced exhalation prematurely because of the discomfort of prolonged forced exhalation. A modified technique in which the patient exhales with maximum force for four seconds followed by continued relaxed exhalation has been shown to enhance the patient's ability to sustain expiration, thereby yielding a larger FVC in patients with airflow obstruction. It should be noted that, strictly speaking, the FVC obtained from using this technique is not a true FVC because maximum expiratory effort was not sustained during the entire exhalation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pulse Oximetry": "\nBackground\n\n\nPulse oximetry is a rapid, noninvasive method of estimating oxygenation and is continuous, allowing detection of sudden changes in a patient’s clinical status. Modern pulse oximeters measure the amount of red and infrared light in an area of pulsatile blood flow. Because red light is primarily absorbed by deoxygenated blood and infrared light is primarily absorbed by oxygenated blood, the ratio of absorption can be measured. Because the amount of light absorbed varies with each pulse wave, the difference of measurement between 2 points in the pulse wave occurs in the arterial blood flow, with more than several hundred measurements per second. This is compared against baseline values, giving both the pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) and the pulse rate.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \nPulse oximeters extract and display SpO2 and heart rate from the photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform every 3 to 6 seconds, and some display the PPG waveform. One side of the pulse oximeter probe contains 2 light-emitting diodes that transmit 2 wavelengths of light, and the other side contains a photodetector. Red light at 660 nm and near-infrared (NIR) light at 940 nm is transmitted through tissue (skin, arteries, capillaries, veins, bone, and fat), and the light that is not absorbed is detected by the photodetector on the opposite side.\n [7] \n\n\nPulse oximetry is a standard monitoring parameter by the American Society of Anesthesiologists for all anesthesia cases. It is also used in hospitalized patients who are receiving medications that may impair respiration, particularly opioids. Pulse oximetry is used to rapidly diagnose hypoxia, as well as to titrate treatment for hypoxia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pulse oximetry has been a useful device in helping establish the need for supplemental oxygen during triage.\n [4, 6, 9, 10] \nOngoing research is being undertaken to allow pulse oximeters to also measure methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin levels, total hemoglobin, and oxygen levels above 100% saturation.\n [4, 5, 8] \n\n\n\n\nThe equipment used for pulse oximetry includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring unit\n\n\n\n\nProbe sensor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the 2 basic types of pulse oximeter probes are transmission probes and reflectance probes.\n\nInterfering factors include nail polish and artificial fingernails, as well as intravenous dyes such as methylene blue and indocyanine green, which can color the serum in the blood and interfere with the light absorption spectrum and affect readings. Dyshemoglobinemias change the color and absorption spectrum of blood and therefore cause false readings. In that case, a co-oximeter should be used for confirmation. Light pollution such as ambient light and light emitted from other probes can cause interference and inaccurate readings. The site or the probe should therefore be convered.\n [4, 11, 12, 6] \n\nTransmission probes\nWith transmission probes, the light emitter and sensor are placed opposite each other on pulsatile tissue such as a digit or ear. The lights used to measure tissue oxygenation are typically placed across from a detector surrounding approximately 5-10 mm of tissue that contains pulsatile blood flow, such as a fingertip or ear lobe.\n\nReflectance probes\nWith reflectance probes, the light emitter and sensor are placed side by side on a flat body surface. The detector lies adjacent to the light source on a flat surface such as the forehead. This information can be used noninvasively to help evaluate the hemodynamic status of a patient and to detect hypoxemia in various clinical settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Rapid Sequence Intubation": "\nBackground\n\n\nAirway management is arguably one of the most important skills for an emergency physician to master because failure to secure an adequate airway can quickly lead to death or disability.\n [1] Endotracheal intubation using rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the cornerstone of emergency airway management.\n [2, 3] \nThe decision to intubate is sometimes difficult. Clinical experience is required to recognize signs of impending respiratory failure. Patients who require intubation have at least one of the following five indications:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Inability to maintain airway patency\n         \n\n\n\n          Inability to protect the airway against aspiration\n         \n\n\n\n          Failure to ventilate\n         \n\n\n\n          Failure to oxygenate\n         \n\n\n\n          Anticipation of a deteriorating course that will eventually lead to respiratory failure\n         \n\n\n\nRSI is the preferred method of endotracheal tube intubation (ETTI) in the emergency department (ED). This is because it results in rapid unconsciousness (induction) and neuromuscular blockade (paralysis). This is important in patients who have not fasted and because of this are at much greater risk for vomiting and aspiration. To this end, the goal of RSI is to intubate the trachea without having to use bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation, which is often necessary when attempting to achieve intubating conditions with sedative agents alone (eg, ketamine, etomidate, propofol).\n\n\n\n\nInstead of titrating to effect, RSI involves administration of weight-based doses of an induction agent (eg, ketamine, etomidate) immediately followed by a paralytic agent (eg, rocuronium, succinylcholine) to render the patient unconscious and paralyzed within 1 minute. These medications share commonality in short onset/offset times and potent efficacies. This method has been proven safe and effective in EDs over the past 4 decades, and it is considered the standard of care. When administered by experienced, well-trained emergency physicians, use of neuromuscular blocking agents in patients undergoing emergent tracheal intubation is associated with a significant decrease in procedure-related complications.\n [4] \nRSI is not indicated in a patient who is unconscious and apneic. This situation is considered a \"crash\" airway, and immediate BVM ventilation and endotracheal intubation without pretreatment, induction, or paralysis is indicated.\n\n\n\n\nRSI should be approached with caution in a patient with a suspected difficult airway. If difficulty is anticipated, then an awake technique or the use of airway adjuncts (eg, fiberoptic intubation) is recommended. Alternatively, anesthesia personnel may be called upon to assist in securing the airway of a difficult-to-intubate patient.\n\nExtrapolating known techniques and procedures that are intuitive and evidence-based from the emergency department to the field often makes sound clinical sense. However, the same standards that govern such modalities should apply wherever they are practiced. Recent literature has questioned the benefit of RSI in the prehospital setting.\n [5] Contributing factors may be the inducement of hyperventilation and hypoxia, both of which have been shown to increase mortality in trauma patients undergoing prehospital RSI.\n [6] \n\nAdditional studies have shown that the use of prehospital RSI is associated with an increased incidence of transient and prolonged hypoxia (57% of patients with a median hypoxic time of 60 s), often going unnoticed by the paramedic.\n [7] Lack of initial and ongoing training, national variability in paramedic protocols, and inadequate experience must be studied and monitored. Randomized prospective studies are needed to better delineate and define the use of prehospital RSI. The ubiquitous use of video-assisted laryngoscopes (VALs) in EDs has been shown to decrease complications in RSI, and, as more prehospital personal train in this modality, similar results may be shown. Indeed, the amount of training required in VAL compared with direct laryngoscopy is less and glotic visualization has been proven to be easier.\n\nThere is a general lack of clinical evidence in several areas of RSI, including use of atropine as an adjunct agent for children, the role of lidocaine in pretreatment, the role of a \"defasciculating\" or priming dose of a nondepolarizing paralytic agent, relative contraindications for use of succinylcholine, and even the amount and methods of preoxygenation and the need to use cricoid pressure (Sellick maneuver). Use of the Sellick maneuver in preventing aspiration has never been proven, but it has been confirmed in increasing airway resistance and decreasing tidal volumes. Also, MRI studies have shown that the esophagus more consistently lies to the right of the trachea than posterior. This article highlights some of these controversies, and the interested reader can also review El-Orbany's 2010 article.\n [8] \n\nThis article focuses on direct laryngoscopy using a traditional direct laryngoscope.  VAL is discussed as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Ravitch Procedure for Pectus Excavatum": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe Ravitch procedure was developed for the surgical treatment of congenital chest-wall deformities, including pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum. These congenital abnormalities are thought to result from abnormal overgrowth of the rib cartilage adjacent to the sternum, displacing the sternum (1) anteriorly, resulting in pectus carinatum; (2) posteriorly, resulting in pectus excavatum; or (3) both anteriorly and posteriorly, resulting in an asymmetric deformity.\n [1, 2] \nPectus excavatum is usually observed at birth and may become more pronounced when the child experiences rapid skeletal growth during adolescence. The exact mechanism underlying abnormal cartilage growth in pectus deformities is unknown. Familial inheritance patterns are present in 37% of cases.\n [3] Most of the remaining cases are idiopathic.\n [4] \n\n\nPectus deformities are also known to be associated with connective-tissue diseases, including Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and can be associated with other skeletal abnormalities, including scoliosis and Poland syndrome.\n [5] \nThe goal of the Ravitch procedure is to remove abnormal rib cartilage while preserving the perichondrium, allowing regrowth of rib cartilage to the sternum in a more anatomic fashion.\n [6]  (See the image below.) Other key elements of the operation include performing a sternal osteotomy to allow redirection of the sternum and stabilization of the sternum with a metal bar, when necessary. Safe performance of concomitant cardiac surgery, if necessary, appears to be possible.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ravitch repair, deformed cartilage anchoring sternum is removed, and sternum is stabilized with metal bar.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nuss procedure is a minimally invasive alternative to the Ravitch procedure for the treatment of pectus deformities. It involves only internal bracing without resection of the abnormal cartilage. A study of the procedural preferences of 135 patients with pectus excavatum found that 62.2% preferred the modified Ravitch procedure and 37.8% the Nuss procedure; it thus appears desirable for surgeons to be experienced with both.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Sleep-Disordered Breathing and CPAP": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nUpper-airway obstruction occurring during sleep—that is, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)—was first demonstrated in the 1960s. SDB represents a group of physiopathologic conditions that are characterized by an abnormal respiratory pattern during sleep that can be isolated or can coexist with other respiratory, nervous, cardiovascular, or endocrine diseases. SDB is now known to be widely prevalent in the general population, and it is responsible for or contributes to numerous problems, ranging from fragmented sleep patterns to hypertension to traffic accidents.\n [1] \nSDB includes obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\n [2] which consists of breathing cessations of at least 10 seconds occurring in the presence of inspiratory efforts during sleep. Central sleep apnea (CSA) is a distinct condition that consists of similar apneas\n [3] ; however, these instead take place in the absence of inspiratory efforts.\n\n\nOSA syndrome (OSAS) is a potentially disabling condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness,\n [4]  disruptive snoring, repeated episodes of upper-airway obstruction during sleep, and nocturnal hypoxemia. It is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; the total number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep), or respiratory disturbance index (RDI), of 5 or higher in association with excessive daytime somnolence.\nRisk factors for sleep apnea include obesity, increased neck circumference, craniofacial abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly. Daytime consequences include not only excessive sleepiness but also impaired cognitive performance and disturbed moods with a reduced quality of life. Excessive daytime sleepiness is reported to be associated with a higher risk of motor vehicle accidents and work place injuries or poor work performance.\n\n\n\n\nIn general, everyone with SDB snores, but not everyone who snores has SDB. Snoring in the absence of SDB is termed primary or simple snoring. However, some evidence indicates that snoring is one end of a clinical continuum, with severe OSA at the opposite end. Some health problems may be associated even with primary snoring. The relation between snoring sounds and severity of OSAS has been widely investigated.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nUpper-airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is characterized by snoring with increased resistance in the upper airway, resulting in arousals during sleep. This can disturb sleep architecture to the point of causing daytime somnolence. No distinct diagnostic criteria exist for this entity. Patients with UARS can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)—specifically, nasal CPAP (n-CPAP).\n [6, 7] \n\nTreatment of SDB involves elimination of contributing factors and provision of n-CPAP. n-CPAP is effective in improving sleep quality and reducing daytime sleepiness. Long-term treatment with n-CPAP reduces both mortality and the acute blood pressure elevation that occurs with SDB.\n [8]  Over time, a trend develops toward baseline blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients with SDB. Medical and surgical interventions may also be indicated.\n\nGo to Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Childhood Sleep Apnea, Central Sleep Apnea Syndromes, Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Home Sleep Monitoring, Surgical Approach to Snoring and Sleep Apnea, Oral Appliances in Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and Upper Airway Evaluation in Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea for more information on these topics.\n\nFor patient education information, see the Sleep Disorders Center, as well as Snoring and Narcolepsy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Thoracic Incisions": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe evolution of the surgical incision has been closely correlated to the major developments in the field of surgery, medicine, and technology. In the early days, before the development of general anesthesia and positive-pressure ventilation, the incisions were mostly small and were used predominantly to drain localized infectious complications, or else they were ingeniously designed to be used via an extrapleural approach (especially to lower thoracic structures).\nWith the use of general anesthesia, incisions became bolder and larger, and the posterolateral thoracotomy was the most widely used approach. The ability to isolate the ipsilateral lung for surgery and the introduction of new stapling devices allowed the use of smaller, more focused incisions with muscle-sparing techniques and minimal rib-spreading.\n\n\nSubsequently, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) introduced a whole new array of minimally invasive options. Thus, in a sense, thoracic surgeons have come full circle, once again using the same small incisions in the chest that were employed in years past, but now with the ability to do much more complex resections than were possible many decades ago.\n [1] \nWith the continued evolution of cardiac surgery, the median sternotomy and its many variations are currently among the most widely used incisions for cardiac procedures; they are occasionally used for thoracic procedures as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Thoracoscopic Wedge Resection": "\nBackground\n\n\nThoracoscopic wedge resection (TWR) is a minimally invasive (non–rib spreading), nonanatomic limited resection of a lung portion. The technique involves a video thoracoscope for access. The only difference between TWR and open resection in terms of technique is that the former involves minimal invasiveness. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a safe procedure, even in high-risk patients such as elderly individuals and those with limited cardiopulmonary reserve.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] It is a parenchymal-sparing procedure that results in earlier recovery than conventional thoracotomy and that is associated with fewer postoperative complications (wound healing, dehiscence, intercostal nerve damage and pain).\nPrecise resection presents unique challenges and localization of the pathology site is arduous in some patients. For example, when the tumor is in the deep parenchyma, tumor identification is very difficult. Prior CT-guided localization is helpful. Margin distance in TWR affects local recurrence and securing a sufficient surgical margin is very important. Use of TWR is more limited when the tumor location is deep to the visceral pleura because it is difficult to secure an adequate surgical margin.\n [5] Overall, TWR is safe and reliable and very useful for lesions at the lung periphery or small lesions at the outer one third of the lung.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Tracheal Resection": "\nBackground\n\n\nTracheal resection with primary reanastomosis for tracheal tumors and stenosis is a well-described procedure.\n [1, 2, 3, 4]  It is most commonly indicated for postintubation lesions but is also performed for malignancies, secondary tracheal tumors, and tracheoesophageal and tracheal innominate fistulas. Approximately half of the trachea can be safely removed with a low incidence of anastomotic complications.\n [2, 3, 4, 5] \nBecause of the lack of suitable replacement material for the trachea, various mobilization and release maneuvers have been demonstrated to increase the length of the tracheal resection by elevating the carina. These include hilar, suprahyoid, and suprathyroid laryngeal release\n [2, 6, 7] ; anterior and posterior digital tracheal dissection; and constant neck flexion. Research into the use of bioprosthetic materials for tracheal replacement is ongoing.\n [8] \n\n\nConstant neck flexion by a suture between the skin of the point of the chin and midline of the chest over the manubrium has been widely considered paramount for successful tracheal resections. An orthosis has also been used as a more comfortable alternative to utilizing the traditional suture between the chin and the midline of the chest over the manubrium.\n [9] The use of tracheal retention sutures on the proximal and distal-lateral edges of the anastomotic line has also been suggested as an alternative to the traditional chin suture for reducing tension on the anastomosis.\n [10] \nThoracoscopic and robotic-assisted tracheal resections, though not as common at present, have also been described.\n [11, 12] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Tracheobronchial Sleeve Resection": "\nBackground\n\n\nMasses located in the proximal airway remain a challenge for the thoracic surgeon. Because of the proximal location, the tenets of preservation of lung function and oncologic resection would seem to be at odds, and in many cases, traditional resection (often meaning pneumonectomy) is not a feasible option for patients who have poor pulmonary reserve at baseline. Additionally, masses located at the level of the carina would be unresectable without a tracheoplastic procedure to restore airway patency.\nThe presence of such complicated problems resulted in the creation of specialized surgical procedures, pioneered first by Price-Thomas in 1947\n [1] to meet the need of a right main bronchus carcinoid mass, and further advanced and popularized by Mathey\n [2]  and then by Paulson and Shaw.\n [3] The current derivation of these techniques is surgical resection that allows both adherence to oncologic principles and preservation of airway anatomy and lung parenchyma, which has been shown to be a valid option in most cases.\n [4] \n\n\nTracheobronchial sleeve resection has made great strides as a viable surgical option for patients requiring extensive pulmonary resections. The benefits make it a desirable surgical approach for many individuals in whom a larger resection either would not be feasible or would cause significant residual morbidity. As with any pulmonary resection, successful management of these patients requires utilization of a team composed of experienced surgeons, oncologists, clinic staff, and hospital nurses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Tracheostomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nTracheostomy is an operative procedure that creates a surgical airway in the cervical trachea.\n [1, 2] It is most often performed in patients who have had difficulty weaning off a ventilator, followed by those who have suffered trauma or a catastrophic neurologic insult.\n [3] Infectious and neoplastic processes are less common in diseases that require a surgical airway.\nTracheostomy is a utilitarian surgical procedure of access; therefore, it should be discussed in light of the problem it addresses: access to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is a conduit between the upper airway and the lungs that delivers moist warm air and expels carbon dioxide and sputum. Failure or blockage at any point along that conduit can be most readily corrected with the provision of access for mechanical ventilators and suction equipment. In the case of upper airway obstruction, tracheostomy provides a path of low resistance for air exchange.\n\n\nThe traditional semantic difference between tracheostomy and tracheotomy is now blurred because the hole is variably permanent. If a cannula is in place, an unsutured opening heals into a patent stoma within a week. If decannulation is performed (ie, the tracheostomy cannula is removed), the hole usually closes in a similar amount of time. The cut edges of the tracheal opening can be sutured to the skin with a few absorbable sutures to facilitate cannulation and, if necessary, recannulation can be performed. Alternatively, a permanent stoma can be created with circumferential sutures. The term tracheostomy is used, by convention, for all these procedures and is considered to be synonymous with tracheotomy.\nThe trachea is nearly but not quite cylindrical but is flattened posteriorly. In cross-section, it is D-shaped, with incomplete cartilaginous rings anteriorly and laterally, and a straight membranous wall posteriorly. The trachea measures about 11 cm in length and is chondromembranous. This structure starts from the inferior part of the larynx (cricoid cartilage) in the neck, opposite the 6th cervical vertebra, to the intervertebral disc between T4-5 vertebrae in the thorax, where it divides at the carina into the right and left main stem bronchi.

        "Tracheostomy Tube Change": "\nBackground\n\n\nTracheostomy has been performed since 1500 BCE and is one of the oldest reported surgical procedures in the medical literature.\n [1, 2]  Before the 19th century, however, the procedure was fraught with difficulty, and only a limited number of successful tracheostomies were reported. During this early period, the indications for tracheostomy were few, but beginning in the early 20th century, with the work of Chevalier Q Jackson, the procedure was refined and standardized.\n [3] \nAs experience with the procedure grew within the surgical community, its morbidity and mortality decreased, and its indications were broadened. In 1999, more than 83,000 tracheostomies were placed in the United States, most commonly for purposes of mechanical ventilation in chronically ill patients.\n [3]  A 2015 study by Mehta et al found that tracheostomy use in mechanically ventilated patients in the United States rose substantially between 1993 and 2008 (to 9.8% of these patients) but decreased somewhat by 2012 (to 8.7%).\n [4] \n\n\nChanging of the tracheostomy tube may warranted for any of several reasons (see Indications).

Compared with open lung biopsy, transbronchial biopsy has lower morbidity and mortality. Biopsy of the lung was performed by means of open surgical methods until 1963, when Anderson performed bronchoscopic lung biopsy with a rigid bronchoscope. In 1974, Levin et al published their experience with transbronchial biopsy using flexible bronchoscopy. This approach has two main rare complications: pneumothorax and severe pulmonary bleeding.\nAdvances in technology are leading to improved yields with fewer complications. Endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS)-guided needle aspiration can be used for mediastinal lymph nodes if these are present and can replace transbronchial biopsy, especially for suspected sarcoidosis. Cryobiopsy of the lung provides a larger specimen without crush artefacts and may replace open lung biopsy.\n\n\nCurrent technology includes three-dimensional (3D) preprocedural computed tomography (CT) planning, radial ultrasonography (with a small fiber), and possibly navigational bronchoscopy. Dual bronchoscopy, with one bronchoscope for cryobiopsy and a second with a balloon-tip catheter, will avoid pneumothorax and massive bleeding.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

The list of specific treatable etiologies is extensive (see Indications), but without intervention, patients are at great risk for major morbidity or mortality.\n\n\nEditor's note: Targeted guidewire and trocar-guided placement are other techniques that are used; however, these are considered high risk for complications in the emergency department setting. Therefore, the classic technique described in this article is the highly recommended one for emergency department thoracostomy tube placement. Additionally, using ultrasound to assess tube placement is an emerging technology; however, chest radiography is the current criterion standard of care, as studies have not yet proven ultrasound to be safer or superior to radiography.

        "Tube Thoracostomy Management": "\nBackground\n\n\nTube thoracostomy is often used to treat pleural effusion, pneumothorax, hemothorax, hemopneumothorax, and empyema.\n [1] The use of chest tubes was described as long ago as the time of Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE), when metal tubes were placed to treat empyema.\n [2, 3] Playfair, treating a child with empyema thoracis in 1873, is credited with being the first physician to use a water-sealed chest drainage system. Chest-tube placement techniques evolved and were perfected during the 1918 flu epidemic and subsequently in the management of combat injuries during World War II.\n [3] \nPhysiologically, a potential space exists between the parietal pleura (abutting chest wall) and the visceral pleura (abutting lung parenchyma), which normally contains less than 25 mL of pleural fluid. The presence of excess fluid, air, blood, chyle, or pus in this pleural space results in displacement of pulmonary volume, which disrupts gas exchange. Prompt drainage of this abnormal intrapleural collection is required to restore normal pulmonary mechanics.\n\n\nIn other scenarios, indwelling chest tubes may be placed for postoperative management of patients after lung resections in order to facilitate creation of space for lung reexpansion. Because chest tubes are used to treat patients with both medical and surgical diagnoses, physicians should be familiar with the appropriate management of patients with these drains.\nDespite the widespread use of tube thoracostomy, management of patients with chest tubes remains subjective.\n [4] There remains a need for more high-quality prospective data to guide postplacement management of chest tubes, and management has been driven mainly by anecdotal experience and institutional protocols.\n [5, 6]  Improper management of inserted chest tubes results in premature or delayed removal, both of which may be associated with increased morbidity, hospital stay, and costs.\n\n\n\n\nThis article discusses the essential and pragmatic concepts of postplacement management of patients with chest tubes.

Ventilator graphics have the added advantage of not producing the noise from the oropharynx that occurs with routine pulmonary function tests, because the endotracheal tube bypasses the oropharynx.\n\n\nPatient-ventilator asynchrony is common and may be seen in as many as 25% of patients within 24 hours after the initiation of mechanical ventilation.\n [4, 5, 6] This article will enable the reader to understand ventilator waveforms and to identify and correct patient-ventilator asynchrony.\n [7, 8] \nThe following Medscape Drugs & Diseases articles may be of interest:\n\n\n\n\n\nBarotrauma and Mechanical Ventilation\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Ventilation\n\n\n\n\nNoninvasive Ventilation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Ventilator Management": "\nIntroduction to Ventilator Management\n\n\nIntubation, with subsequent mechanical ventilation, is a common life-saving intervention in the emergency department (ED). Given the increasing length of stay of ventilated patients in EDs, it is necessary for emergency practitioners to have a good understanding of techniques to optimize mechanical ventilation and minimize complications.\nMany different strategies of positive-pressure ventilation are available; these are based on various permutations of triggered volume-cycled and pressure-cycled ventilations and are delivered at a range of rates, volumes, and pressures. Poor ventilatory management can inflict serious pulmonary and extrapulmonary damage that may not be immediately apparent.\n\n\nBecause many of the effects of ventilator-induced lung injury are delayed and not seen while patients are in the ED, much of our understanding of the adverse consequences of volutrauma, air-trapping, barotrauma, and oxygen toxicity has come from the critical care literature. While the fundamental principles underlying mechanical ventilatory support have changed little over the decades, much progress has been made in our understanding of the secondary pathophysiologic changes associated with positive-pressure ventilation.\nVentilatory strategies have been devised for different disease processes to protect pulmonary parenchyma while maintaining adequate gas exchange, and they may be responsible for the increased rates of survival for pathologies such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Several recent clinical trials have demonstrated that optimizing ventilatory parameters reduces overall duration of mechanical ventilation and organ failure. Additionally, an upsurge in utilization of noninvasive ventilation has permitted many patients to avoid the risks and complications of tracheal intubation.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Images are magnified when displayed on the monitor, allowing for detailed examination of the larynx. Video laryngoscopy is the premise of fiberoptic intubation.\n\n\n\n\nFiberoptic intubation involves threading an endotracheal (ET) tube over the shaft of a flexible fiberoptic scope. The scope is passed through the mouth or the nose of the patient, into the pharynx, and through the vocal folds into the patient’s trachea. Upon visual confirmation of tracheal rings and carina, the fiberoptic scope is held steady while the ET tube is advanced over the fiberoptic bundle into the patient's airway. Once the tube is in place, the scope is removed, and the patient is ventilated.\n\n\n\n\nFiberoptic intubation is often performed with the endoscopist looking through the eyepiece of the fiberoptic scope. However, connecting the scope to a monitor is often advantageous. In this setting, others can observe the procedure, making it an excellent teaching adjunct.\n [3, 4] \n\nVideo laryngoscopy is also used with rigid transoral laryngoscopy. Tools such as the Airtraq laryngoscope (Prodol Meditec, Spain), the GlideScope (Verathon, Bothell, WA), and the Pentax-AWS (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) are variations of a rigid laryngoscope with a digital camera that allows view of the larynx on a screen.

        "Antiepileptic Drugs": "\nOverview\n\n\nModern treatment of seizures started in 1850 with the introduction of bromides, which was based on the theory that epilepsy was caused by an excessive sex drive. In 1910, phenobarbital (PHB), which then was used to induce sleep, was found to have antiseizure activity and became the drug of choice for many years. A number of medications similar to PHB were developed, including primidone.\nIn 1938, Houston Merrit and Tracy Putnam described animal models for screening multiple compounds for antiepileptic activity in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In 1940, phenytoin (PHT) was found to be an effective drug for the treatment of epilepsy, and since then it has become a major first-line antiepileptic drug (AED) in the treatment of partial and secondarily generalized seizures.\n\n\nIn 1968, carbamazepine (CBZ) was approved, initially for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia; later, in 1974, it was approved for partial seizures. Ethosuximide has been used since 1958 as a first-choice drug for the treatment of absence seizures without generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Valproate (VPA) was licensed in Europe in 1960 and in the United States in 1978, and now is widely available throughout the world. It became the drug of choice in primary generalized epilepsies and in the mid 1990s was approved for treatment of partial seizures.\nThese anticonvulsants were the mainstays of seizure treatment until the 1990s, when newer AEDs with good efficacy, fewer toxic effects, better tolerability, and no need for blood level monitoring were developed. A study of live-born infants in Denmark found that exposure to the newer-generation AEDs lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, and levetiracetam in the first trimester was not associated with an increased risk in major birth defects.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nThe new AEDs have been approved in the United States as add-on therapy only, with the exception of topiramate and oxcarbazepine (OXC); lamotrigine (LTG) is approved for conversion to monotherapy. A meta-analysis of 70 randomized clinical trials confirms the clinical impression that efficacy does not significantly differ among AEDs used for refractory partial epilepsy.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nAntiepileptic drugs should be used carefully, with consideration of medication interactions and potential side effects.

        "Blood Substitutes": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe attempt to develop a viable blood substitute spans more than 7 decades. These efforts have essentially focused on the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. Hence, most of the products that are in advanced-phase clinical trials are derivatives of hemoglobin and are known as hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs).\n [1, 2] \nToday, an increase in the number of elective surgeries and the still prevalent but small risk of transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as HIV have served as a stimulus to develop a synthetic substitute for human blood, more specifically for development of a red blood cell substitute.\n\n\nHowever, to date, no oxygen-carrying blood substitutes are approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. This fact highlights not only the challenges that exist in formulating an effective blood substitute but also the immense potential that exists in this field.\nThe physiology of oxygen transport can be described as follows:\n\n\n\n\nOne gram of adult hemoglobin binds to 1.39 milliliters of oxygen. The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (see the image below) has a characteristic sigmoid shape due to the cooperative effect that exists between the multiple oxygen binding sites on the hemoglobin molecule. Factors that modify the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen include body temperature, pH of blood and the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve plots the proportion of hemoglobin in its saturated form on the vertical axis against the prevailing oxygen tension on the horizontal axis.

        "Botulinum Toxin": "\nOverview\n\n\nBotulinum toxin (abbreviated either as BTX or BoNT) is produced by Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium.\n [1] The clinical syndrome of botulism can occur following ingestion of contaminated food, from colonization of the infant gastrointestinal tract, or from a wound infection.\nBoNT is broken into 7 neurotoxins (labeled as types A, B, C [C1, C2], D, E, F, and G), which are antigenically and serologically distinct but structurally similar. Human botulism is caused mainly by types A, B, E, and (rarely) F. Types C and D cause toxicity only in animals.\n\n\nThe various botulinum toxins possess individual potencies, and care is required to assure proper use and avoid medication errors. Recent changes to the established drug names by the FDA were intended to reinforce these differences and prevent medication errors. The products and their approved indications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®, Botox Cosmetic®) \n          See the list below:\n\n\n\nBotox® - Cervical dystonia, severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis, strabismus, blepharospasm, neurogenic detrusor overactivity, chronic migraine, upper limb spasticity\n\nBotox Cosmetic® - Moderate to severe glabellar lines, moderate to severe lateral canthal lines, known as crow’s feet\n\n\n\n\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®) - Upper and lower limb spasticity, cervical dystonia, and moderate-to-severe glabellar lines in adults; it is also indicated for lower limb spasticity in children aged 2 years or older\n         \n\n\n\nIncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) - Upper limb spasticity, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, moderate to severe glabellar lines, chronic sialorrhea\n         \n\n\n\nPrabotulinumtoxinA (Jeuveau®) - Moderate-to-severe glabellar lines \n         \n\n\n\nDaxibotulinumtoxinA (Daxxify®) - Moderate-to-severe glabellar lines \n         \n\n\n\nRimabotulinumtoxinB (Myobloc®) - Cervical dystonia\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nThe BoNT molecule is synthesized as a single chain (150 kD) and then cleaved to form the dichain molecule with a disulfide bridge (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBotulinum toxin structure (schematic diagram). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe light chain (~50 kD - amino acids 1-448) acts as a zinc (Zn2+) endopeptidase similar to tetanus toxin with proteolytic activity located at the N-terminal end (see image below).

        "Botulinum Toxin in Pain Management": "\nOverview\n\n\nDiagnosis and treatment of painful muscle syndromes can be a difficult and frustrating task for any clinician. Typically, the mainstay of therapy for such conditions is therapeutic exercise, analgesics, and a tincture of time. Unfortunately, not all patients respond to this paradigm, and, despite heroic efforts on the part of the treating clinician, some conditions are refractory to this approach.\nReports have described the purported effectiveness of using a biologic neuromuscular blocking agent, botulinum toxin, in the treatment of painful conditions associated with skeletal muscle. While incompletely understood and at times controversial, use of botulinum toxin in the treatment of conditions associated with involuntary muscle contraction, such as focal dystonia and spasticity, is supported by prospective, randomized clinical research; however, while the volume of comparable studies in pain syndromes is growing, the number of clinical randomized trials is limited. Moreover, not all such reports have demonstrated clear efficacy of the use of botulinum toxin under all circumstances. Therefore, in view of our current understanding of the nature of muscle-induced pain and the paucity of prospective research regarding neuromuscular blockade and/or inhibition of nociception in such conditions, critical and careful analysis of the data and opinions presented in this section is appropriate.\n\n\nThis article provides general direction and practical details for the clinician considering botulinum toxin for treatment of pain. Anatomic drawings for injection localization and dosing information are intended only as general guidelines; therapy with botulinum toxin always must be individualized, accounting for the patient's needs and the clinician's expertise. In addition, information presented should be used as a convenient reference source, not as a substitute for clinical training in the use of botulinum toxin.\nFor excellent patient education resources, see eMedicineHealth's patient education articles BOTOX® Injections and Chronic Pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Chemical Restraint": "\nOverview\n\n\nMany physicians and healthcare workers will be or have been threatened by an agitated patient. Workplace violence is increasing. Between 1993 and 1999, 1.7 million episodes of workplace-related violence were reported annually in the United States; in 12% of these episodes, the victim was a healthcare or mental health worker.\n [1] \nSuch threats are often underreported in the emergency department (ED). Gates et al reported that most of the emergency care workers in 5 midwestern hospitals had experienced verbal abuse and that 51% of physicians and 67% of nurses had been physically assaulted at least once in the preceding 6 months.\n [2] In addition, up to 25% of ED staff feel unsafe, and 20% of EDs reported that guns or knives were brought to the ED on a daily or weekly basis.\n [1] Furthermore, a survey of psychiatry residents showed that 73% had been threatened and 36% had been physically assaulted during residency.\n [3]  Despite an increase in hospital security measures in recent years, more than 38% of emergency physicians reported that they had experienced physical assault.\n [4] \n\n\nAgitation in the violent patient that manifests in an acute care setting likely has many contributing causes. Agitation is generally multifactorial and can be the result of long wait times, confusion, substance intoxication and withdrawal, significant illness, and mental health crisis. The possible physical causes of agitation (eg, hypoxia, dementia) must be assessed. Behavioral emergencies are frequently complex and dangerous and require prompt control to prevent injury to the patient, staff, and others present in the department.\nUltimately, a patient who poses a threat to himself or others requires some form of restraint. Physical and chemical restraints can be used as a last resort to help control a violent situation. The 3 main classes of medications used to chemically restrain a patient are benzodiazepines, typical or classic antipsychotics, and atypical antipsychotics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Diuretics and Heart Failure": "\nBackground\n\n\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the most common chronic conditions in the United States, affecting an estimated 5.7 million people\n [1] and is the leading diagnosis for hospitalized patients. The most frequent presenting symptom for patients with CHF is dyspnea, which is often attributed to pulmonary edema and occurs in 93% of patients.\n [2] The second most frequent symptom is peripheral edema, occurring in 70%.\n [2] Naturally, one of the mainstays of therapy has been to target hypervolemia through the use of diuretics.\nThe therapeutic effects of diuretics have been known for centuries, and they were perhaps the first treatment available for CHF. As early as the 1600s, mercurial-based diuretics were used for the treatment of edema, termed dropsy. The 20th century saw the advent of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, followed by thiazide diuretics, and finally loop diuretics. Currently, diuretics remain some of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States. Diuretics have proven to be an integral component to the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure, and their use has been extensively studied. Their efficacy in improving symptoms such as dyspnea and edema is clear; however, little data support a mortality benefit or an alteration in disease progression.\n\n\nFor many years, diuretics have been the cornerstone for treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure. Guidelines for the use of diuretics in both the inpatient and outpatient setting are largely based on expert opinion. Diuretics clearly improve hemodynamics and symptoms, although many studies have not been able to demonstrate a mortality benefit. In part, their effectiveness may be limited by adverse effects including electrolyte imbalances and neurohormonal activation. As new treatments for heart failure emerge, future research must address how diuretics fits into the armamentarium.\nPharmacology\nKnowledge of the pharmacology of diuretics is essential in understanding their function in the management of heart failure. The current available loop diuretics are furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, and ethacrynic acid. They inhibit the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. By effectively inhibiting sodium reabsorption, they also reduce water reabsorption. The loop diuretics bind to the luminal surface of the transporter; thus, they must be secreted into the tubular lumen. As the glomerular filtration rate is reduced, luminal secretion is decreased, and less drug reaches the active site.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOral absorption of furosemide widely varies. Bumetanide and torsemide have greater bioavailability and more predictable pharmacokinetics. All of the loop diuretics except ethacrynic acid contain a sulfonamide group. Individuals who are allergic to sulfonamide antibiotics may be allergic to sulfonamide diuretics, although recent research suggests that the cross-reactivity is low.\n [4] Ethacrynic acid is rarely used other than in individuals with sulfa allergies.\n\nThiazide diuretics are most commonly used to treat hypertension, although they can be adjuncts in the management of heart failure. They inhibit the Na-Cl symporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to decreased sodium and water reabsorption. Spironolactone inhibits the aldosterone receptor in the cortical collecting duct, also limiting sodium and water reabsorption. Its diuretic effect is relatively weak, and its onset of action is slow.\n\nMechanism of action\nThe pulmonary and peripheral edema seen in CHF are the result of multiple physiologic disturbances. Decreased cardiac output leads to relative renal hypoperfusion that stimulates neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Sodium and free water retention occur, resulting in an increase in both volume and pressure in capacitance vessels. Hydrostatic pressure elevation leads to fluid extravasation into peripheral tissues as well as the lungs.\n\nThe Frank-Starling law describes the mechanism whereby a normal heart under a physiologic range of filling pressures increases stroke volume proportionally with an increase in preload. In contrast, in acute decompensated heart failure, a myopathic heart subjected to very elevated filling pressures is not able to effectively increase stroke volume. Acute elevation of left ventricular preload (end-diastolic pressure) directly leads to elevated left atrial pressures and pulmonary edema. Diuretics reduce intravascular volume, leading to a decrease in central venous pressure, right and left heart filling pressures, and pulmonary vascular pressures. Venous capacitance increases, and intrapulmonary fluid returns to the circulation. The left ventricular volume is smaller, and cardiac output typically increases. In the setting of mitral regurgitation, the reduced left ventricular volume improves mitral leaflet coaptation and decreases the regurgitant volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Endocannabinoids": "\nOverview\n\n\nHumans and animals alike naturally synthesize endocannabinoids, chemical compounds that activate the same receptors as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component of marijuana (Cannabis sativa).

Consequently, inhibition of endocannabinoids may be a tool in reducing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and augmenting the benefits of physical exercise.\n [3, 4] Furthermore, modulation of the endocannabinoid system may be a cure for more chronic neurologic and immune conditions. Research in animal models suggests the possible use of cannabinoids as anticancer drugs.\n [5, 6] \n\nThe endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a unique and ubiquitous cell-signaling system that is just beginning to be understood. The biochemistry of endocannabinoid synthesis, metabolism, and bioactivity has been difficult to study in the past. Newer techniques such as genetically modified animals, pharmacologic probes, and molecular biology promise to reveal some of these mysteries. The greater promise is that with this understanding, the ECS will yield insights into the mechanisms of health and disease and provide important new therapeutic options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Estrogen Therapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nEstrogen therapy, with or without a progestogen (progesterone and progestin), has long been prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms. It has been extensively studied, and it is the most consistently effective therapy for vasomotor symptoms.\n [1] Data from numerous studies suggest that oral, transdermal, or vaginal hormone therapy reduces the severity of hot flashes by 65-90%.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  \nEstrogen, a steroid hormone, is derived from the androgenic precursors androstenedione and testosterone by means of aromatization. In order of potency, naturally occurring estrogens are 17 (beta)-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3). The synthesis and actions of these estrogens are complex.\n\n\nIn brief, these forms of estrogen can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nEstradiol - Primarily produced by theca and granulosa cells of the ovary; it is the predominant form of estrogen found in premenopausal women\n\n\n\n\nEstrone - Formed from estradiol in a reversible reaction; this is the predominant form of circulating estrogen after menopause; estrone is also a product of the peripheral conversion of androstenedione secreted by the adrenal cortex\n\n\n\n\nEstriol - The estrogen the placenta secretes during pregnancy; in addition, it is the peripheral metabolite of estradiol and estrone; it is not secreted by the ovary\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 summarizes normal concentrations of the various estrogens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

ECP, also known as extracorporeal photochemotherapy and extracorporeal photoimmunotherapy, is performed at over 200 centers worldwide.\n [1, 2, 3] \nIn addition to CTCL, ECP has been shown to have efficacy in the treatment of other disorders, including graft versus host disease (GVHD), solid organ transplant rejection, scleroderma, atopic dermatitis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, lichen planus, lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, Crohn disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n [4, 5] Extracorporeal photopheresis may also have some use in the treatment of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, and scleromyxedema.\n [1, 6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Over the past 50 years, the medical community has witnessed great advances in the care of patients receiving organ transplants. Improved therapeutic strategies have been associated with better patient and graft survival rates; however, the adverse effects associated with these agents and the risks of long-term immunosuppression present a number of challenges for the clinician. With all the successes of immunosuppressive therapies come the obligations to tailor treatments to meet the individual patient's characteristics and to balance the risks and benefits of these medications.\nThe image below depicts the points of action of immunosuppressive drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplified diagram illustrating the points of action of immunosuppressive drugs. Corticosteroids inhibit production of interleukin-1. Macrolides (ie, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) inhibit production of or use of interleukin-2, thus inhibiting stimulation of a clone of cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against specific human lymphocyte antigen types. Antimetabolites (ie, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine) inhibit purine production, thus impairing cell proliferation. Antibodies impair normal function of cell surface markers, thus inhibiting stimulation of T-lymphocyte clones directed against foreign antigens. Diagram provided by David A.

        "Immunotherapeutic Targeting in Children": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe backbone of cancer therapy in pediatric oncology has been stepwise integration of multimodality therapies (eg, chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy) into carefully designed treatment regimens tested sequentially through multicenter randomized trials. Although chemotherapy has been effective in eradicating micrometastatic disease in some conditions and remains a principal determinant of success, the toxicity associated with current cytotoxics is substantial, and current agents have not proven curative in several clinical groups.\nHence, the need is growing for the development of effective, alternative anticancer therapies for use in children with tumors. Dramatic progress in technology has improved our understanding of the basic biology of tumor immunology, and immune-based therapies represent one approach that could be integrated into current multimodal regimens to eradicate micrometastatic disease.\n\n\nImmunotherapeutic targeting of cancers is an attractive, novel modality that could be used either in conjunction with conventional therapies or separate from these therapies. Evidence currently suggests that the mechanisms responsible for resistance to cytotoxic agents generally do not confer resistance to immune-mediated mechanisms of tumor-cell killing.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nThe immune system participates in immunosurveillance of tumors, as evidenced by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients develop spontaneous innate and acquired immune responses to their tumors.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nOne positive prognostic indicator of patient survival in many histologies is infiltration of lymphocytes within a tumor.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nImmunosuppressed transplant recipients display higher incidences of nonviral tumors than age-matched immunocompetent controls.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nVarious murine studies have reported that both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors occur more frequently in mice that lack various elements of innate and adaptive immunity.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\nTumors are less able to survive in immunocompetent mice.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last observation provides evidence that the development of immune-evasive properties occurs in response to immune pressure early during the period of oncogenesis. Merchant and colleagues also suggest that T-cell–depleting cancer therapies may eliminate beneficial immune responses and that immune reconstitution of patients with lymphopenic cancer could prevent metastatic recurrence of solid tumors.\n [9] \n\nIn summary, current models hold that tumor antigens are present and induce immune reactivity during incipient tumor growth and that tumors subsequently develop properties to evade these immune responses. The challenge to the current field is to elucidate the biology of host-tumor interactions at the time of clinical presentation with cancer and to develop approaches that diminish the capacity for tumors to evade immunity and amplify host antitumor immune responses. In pediatric oncology, the ability to apply such therapies during a period of minimal residual disease is compelling and can often be accomplished with modern multimodality therapies.\n\nThe immune system consists of multiple levels of defense against invading pathogens. It consists of physical barriers, mechanisms of innate immunity as well as adaptive immunity. The physical barrier can be mechanical, chemical, or biological and located at different sites in the body including skin, secretions within the respiratory tract, and in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract as flora. The cells that have the inherent property of innate and adaptive immunity within the body are present at different sites including the blood, lymphatic system (lymph, lymphoid nodules and lymphoid organs), epithelium, and connective tissues. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Immune System Anatomy.\n\nCurrent immunotherapies may involve either innate or adaptive (acquired) immunity.\n\nInnate immunity does not induce immunologic memory. It can directly kill tumor cells. This immunity plays a critical role in initiating adaptive immune responses. Innate immunity includes the role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in improving antitumor and vaccine responses, muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE) in osteosarcoma, and natural killer (NK) cell–killer immunoglobulinlike receptor (KIR) mismatch. This can also augment tumor growth and invasion.\n\nAdaptive immunity induces immunologic memory and can directly kill tumor cells or recruit other effectors through cytokine production. B cells are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that generate antibodies in response to a foreign antigen.\n\nT cells are potent tumor cell killers that recognize peptides derived from the target cell (extracellular or intracellular) but must be presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Activation of T cells also requires a second signal provided by a costimulatory molecule. T cells used in a donor lymphocyte infusion or as part of a stem cell transplant can have potent graft-versus-leukemia effects.\n\nVaccines have been designed as a means of providing a targeted tumor antigen with an appropriate costimulatory signal to enhance T-cell responses. Cytokines and growth factors have been used on pediatric tumors as a means of directly killing tumors or improving host antitumor responses but with limited success.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) target only cell surface antigens and can induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement fixation; they can be directly cytotoxic or serve as targeting agents to deliver lethal “hits.” mAbs have been used as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy and can be conjugated with radioisotopes or toxins to enhance their potency.\n\nGo to Induction of Tolerance for information on this topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Immunotherapy for Allergies": "\nBackground\n\n\nAllergen immunotherapy can provide significant improvements in allergic symptoms and reduce the need for additional pharmacotherapy. Allergen immunotherapy has been clinically demonstrated to provide long-term clinical benefits, including symptomatic disease remission and a reduction in allergic disease progression from rhinitis to asthma.\n [1] \nThe first report describing immunotherapy was published in 1911, when Noon described that the subcutaneous injection of a pollen extract suppressed allergen-induced symptoms. Since then, allergen immunotherapy has been used in medical practice to successfully treat hypersensitivity to many allergens, including dust mites, grass, ragweed and tree pollen, insect venom, and animal dander. Allergen immunotherapy is appropriate for patients suffering from immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated allergic diseases such as seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial rhinitis, allergic asthma, and insect venomanaphylaxis.\n\n\nAside from allergen immunotherapy, the other available treatment options for allergic diseases include aeroallergen avoidance and pharmacotherapy. In addition, surgery may be offered as an adjunct in appropriate patients (eg, septoplasty for nasal septal deviation, sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis, turbinate reduction for turbinate hypertrophy, nasal polypectomy for nasal polyps).\nEffective treatment reduces symptoms and medication utilization while improving quality of life. Allergen immunotherapy has demonstrated long-term effectiveness in symptom reduction more than 3 years following treatment cessation and has prevented the development of new sensitizations in children.\n\n\n\n\nAllergic pathophysiology and method of action\nWithin seconds to minutes of allergen exposure, mast cells initiate granule exocytosis, releasing preformed histamine, serine proteases, and proteoglycans. These series of cellular events give rise to immediate allergic symptoms that peak within 15-30 minutes and affect the skin, eyes, and both upper and lower respiratory systems. Mast cells also synthesize prostaglandins and leukotrienes and release additional proinflammatory mediators and cytokines, which increase vascular permeability and promote recruitment of other effector cells.\n\n\n\n\nA second, or late phase, of allergic inflammation can occur approximately 6-12 hours after allergen exposure. This late allergic response is the result of activated CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and basophils leaving the bloodstream and infiltrating the local tissue upon allergen exposure. Each of these cell types contains important mediators in the allergic response: Basophils have histamine-containing granules; eosinophils contain major basic protein and leukotrienes, particularly leukotriene C4; and neutrophils produce lipids, cytokines, and proteases that directly damage tissues, including mucosal membranes, and further augment mast cell and eosinophil activity.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] \n\nAllergen immunotherapy suppresses the allergen-induced late response and diminishes the immediate phase via prevention of allergen-driven Th2 responses, including reductions in levels of interleukin (IL)–4, IL-13, IL-5, and IL-9. Perhaps more importantly, the decrease in Th2 response is complemented by a change in the immune response to one favoring the “protective” Th1 pathways. Allergen immunotherapy induces IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β–secreting T regulatory cells, which appear to suppress Th2 responses. Additionally, IL-10 contributes to the switching of immunoglobulin isotypes to IgG4, and TGFβ mediates switching to IgA.\n\nThe down-regulation of the allergic response in a patient undergoing allergen immunotherapy is attributed to increases in IgG1, IgG4, and IgA, and also a decrease in IgE. This alteration is affiliated with significant reductions in the numbers of infiltrating T cells, basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. IgG4 antibodies also block allergen-induced IgE-dependent histamine released by basophils. Allergen immunotherapy results in a long-term reduction in serum allergen-specific IgE levels. Significant reductions in the early-phase response have also been demonstrated.\n [9, 10, 11, 8, 12] \n\nSublingual immunotherapy\nSublingual immunotherapy experienced renewed interest in England after a review of safety and protocols of subcutaneous immunotherapy identified a 0.5%-5.6% rate of systemic reactions and fatalities, most commonly due to \"preventable errors.\" These findings reduced the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy in Britain and encouraged research into allergy treatment with sublingual immunotherapy. Most of the data address monotherapy, and research has yet to delineate ideal dosing concentrations, dosing schedules, dosing duration, and duration of patient response.\n\nIn sublingual immunotherapy, the theory is that the antigen comes into contact with Langerhans-like dendritic cells residing in the oral mucosa on the floor of the mouth under the tongue. These cells capture the antigen and migrate to local lymph nodes, resulting in the production of blocking antibodies and induction of T-regulator cells, which then suppress Th-1 and Th-2 cellular response via IL-10 and TGFβ mechanisms, both of which are described in detail above.\n [13, 14] \n\nSublingual immunotherapy has been demonstrated to decrease allergen-specific IgE, bronchial reactivity, and nasal and conjunctival eosinophils and neutrophils and to increase IgG4, IL-10, TGFβ, and interferon (INF)–gamma. Significant long-lasting symptom control of allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma has been demonstrated in multiple studies. This method is very convenient for patients, decreases blood and latex exposure, and is believed to be quite safe , although several cases of anaphylaxis have been reported in the literature.\n [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Infiltrative Administration of Local Anesthetic Agents": "\nOverview\n\n\nMechanism of action\nLocal anesthetics reversibly block nerve conduction near their site of administration, thereby producing temporary loss of sensation in a limited area. Nerve impulse conduction is blocked by inhibition of sodium channels at the nerve endings and along the axon. This causes a decrease in nerve cell membrane permeability to sodium ions, possibly by competing with calcium-binding sites that control sodium permeability. This change in permeability results in decreased depolarization and an increased excitability threshold that ultimately prevents the nerve action potential from forming.\n [1, 2, 3] \n\n\nIndications\nLocal anesthetics are used for infiltration and nerve block anesthesia. Because of variation in systemic absorption and toxicity, the ideal choice of local anesthetic and concentration depends on the intended procedure. Infiltration anesthesia is often used for minor surgical and dental procedures. Nerve block anesthesia is used for surgical, dental, and diagnostic procedures and for pain management.\n [4, 5] \n\n\n\n\nUses for infiltrative anesthetics are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nSubcutaneous infiltration (IV placement, superficial/shave biopsy, suturing)\n\n\n\n\nSubmucosal infiltration (dental procedures, laceration repairs)\n\n\n\n\nWound infiltration (postoperative pain control at incision site)\n\n\n\n\nIntraarticular injections (postsurgical pain control, arthritic joint pain control)\n\n\n\n\nInfiltrative nerve blocks (ankle block, scalp block, digit block)\n [6, 7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Intermittent Insulin Injections": "\nInsulin Overview\n\n\nInsulin is the cornerstone of therapy in the management of type 1 diabetes. Insulin therapy also has a clear role in type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with long-standing or poorly controlled disease.\n [1] \nSince the discovery of insulin approximately 80 years ago, insulin therapy has undergone various changes in formulations with different pharmacokinetics. In the 1930s, protamine zinc insulin, the first long-acting preparation, was introduced. In the 1950s, the neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) and insulin zinc (lente) were introduced.\n [2] Newer formulations have since been developed, allowing insulin to be provided in more physiologically appropriate ways. These provide more flexibility in dosing, mimic endogenous production of insulin, and lower the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia.\n [3, 4, 5] \n\n\nWhen used as monotherapy, oral hypoglycemic drugs generally lower glycated hemoglobin (HgbA1C) by only 0.5%-1.5%. Most patients with type 2 diabetes eventually require multidrug therapy or insulin. Some guidelines encourage early use of insulin if HgbA1C remains poorly controlled on maximal-dose, single-drug therapy. Insulins have varying pharmacokinetics that allow for specific products from which to choose. Table 1 provides a comparison between insulins for onset of action and duration of action.

Their onset of action is approximately 5-15 minutes, peak action is between 30 and 90 minutes, and duration of action is approximately 4-6 hours. Regular insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R) is categorized as short-acting with a short duration of action and regular onset of action. Regular insulin's onset is 30-60 minutes, peak is 2-3 hours, and duration of action is approximately 8-10 hours. In general, insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine are slightly more effective than regular insulin in decreasing HgbA1C, with less nocturnal hypoglycemia.\n [6] \n\nIn September 2017, Fiasp (insulin aspart injection) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This rapid-acting human insulin analog can be dosed at the start of a meal or within 20 minutes after starting a meal. Fiasp is formulated with niacinamide, which helps increase the speed of the initial insulin absorption. A pharmacokinetics study of adult patients with type 1 diabetes showed that Fiasp appeared in the circulation in approximately 2.5 minutes after administration. The time to maximum insulin concentrations was achieved in roughly 63 minutes after administration.\n [7] \n\nIn the manufacturing of regular insulin, zinc atoms are added, causing the formation of hexamers.\n [2] Because they are larger molecules, they diffuse slowly into the circulation. On the other hand, insulin lispro has lysine and proline inverted at the B28 and B29 position and insulin aspart has the proline at position 28 replaced by aspartic acid.\n [2] These changes in structure reduce the formation of dimers and hexamers, and they are rapidly absorbed. The short-acting insulins typically are used as bolus insulin given premeal. The rapid-acting insulins are administered immediately before a meal, whereas regular insulin is administered 30 minutes before a meal.\n [8] \n\nInsulin NPH (Humulin N, Novolin N) is an intermediate-acting insulin that is a suspension of crystalline zinc insulin combined with the positively charged polypeptide protamine. Unlike the shorter-acting insulins, NPH has a longer duration of action, yet not as long as the newer long-acting insulins. Insulin NPH's onset of action is 2-4 hours, peak action is 4-10 hours, and duration of action is approximately 12-18 hours.\n\nNPH insulin is also available in combination with regular insulin (insulin isophane human/insulin regular human). They are in a fixed combination of either 70% or 75% of NPH and 25% or 30% of regular insulin. These are marketed as Humulin 70/30 or Novolin 70/30. It is also available with NPH and a rapid-acting insulin combination. NPH/lispro mixtures are Humalog Mix 50/50, Humalog Mix 50/50 KwikPen, Humalog Mix 75/25, and Humalog Mix 75/25 KwikPen. NPH/aspart mixtures are marketed as NovoLog Mix 70/30 and NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen. These combinations are a good option for patients who may be noncompliant, those who want to reduce theirnumber of self-injections, and those who are unable to use more sophisticated regimens. On the other hand, it is hard to manipulate the dosing because they are in a fixed combination.\n\nThe long-acting insulin analogs were made with recombinant DNA technology. Insulin glargine (Lantus) is made by replacing the asparagine by glycine in the A-chain and adding 2 arginines at the C-terminus of the B-chain. When injected into subcutaneous tissue, this forms microprecipitates, which then delays absorption from the injection site. Insulin detemir (Levemir) is manufactured by elimination of the amino acid threonine at position B30 and the addition of a 14-carbon fatty acid chain at position B29. Insulin detemir is also slowly absorbed from the injection site; in addition, it is also reversibly bound to albumin in the blood, which further prolongs its action and clearance.\n [2] \n\nOf the two that are currently available, insulin glargine is considered long-acting, and insulin detemir is considered intermediate-to-long acting. Insulin detemir may have to be given twice a day because it may wear off before the subsequent dose.\n [9] The long-acting insulins, in addition to having a long duration of action, do not have a pronounced peak effect. Some European studies have shown an association of increased risk of cancer with insulin glargine, as opposed to other insulins.\n [10] Although this may be alarming, these studies have not been convincing.\n\nOnce-weekly injectable insulin is being studied in patients with type 2 diabetes. Phase 2 data show that it is comparable in efficacy and safety to insulin glargine.\n [11] \n\nWhen insulin therapy is initiated in a patient who is already on oral medication, a basal (long- or intermediate-acting) rather than short-acting or premeal insulin should be chosen. Basal insulin helps improve nocturnal and fasting blood glucose levels, whereas premeal bolus insulin decreases postprandial glucose elevations. When choosing a basal insulin and drug cost is not a barrier, insulin glargine or detemir may be a better option than NPH insulin because they do not have a peak and therefore have a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia.\n\nIn all patients with type 1 diabetes and in patients with type 2 diabetes with elevated levels of postprandial blood glucose, a bolus premeal insulin should be given. All patients with type 1 diabetes and patients on oral medications may be started on basal insulin. For basal insulin, either the intermediate-acting or the long-acting insulins are used, and, for bolus or preprandial insulin, the short-acting insulins are used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Intravenous Immunoglobulin": "\nOverview\n\n\nImmune globulin products from human plasma were first used in 1952 to treat primary immune deficiency. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains the pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoglobulins from the plasma of approximately a thousand or more blood donors.\nIVIGs are sterile, purified IgG products manufactured from pooled human plasma and typically contain more than 95% unmodified IgG, which has intact Fc-dependent effector functions and only trace amounts of immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n [1] Initially, immune globulin products were administered by intramuscular injection. One of biggest advances with IVIG in recent years has been the use of sorbitol-based formulations as opposed to sucrose-based formulations, which allow for IV administration with fewer reactions.\n [2, 3]  IVIG was initially shown to be effective in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in 1981.\n [4] There are now multiple alternative IVIG preparations available for intravenous administration that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiencies and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.  Also, a liquid, pasteurized, 10% concentrated intravenous gammaglobulin preparation is as effective as a 5% concentrated preparation, making the concentrated versions more convenient to administer.\n\n\nThe image below is a schematic representation of an immunoglobulin G molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of an immunoglobulin G molecule. CH indicates constant region of heavy chain; CL, constant region of light chain; VH, variable region of heavy chain; and VL, variable region of light chain. \n\n\n\n\n\nIVIG is an immunomodulating agent that has multiple activities. These include modulation of complement activation; suppression of idiotypic antibodies; saturation of Fc receptors on macrophages; and suppression of various inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteinases.\n [5] Fc receptors are a class of receptors on immune cells that bind to the Fc (constant region) portion of an antibody. The Fc region of IgG facilitates interaction with and signaling through Fc receptors on antigen presenting cells such as phagocytes, B cells, and other cells and with Fc-binding plasma proteins (eg, components of the complement system).\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nBlockade of macrophage Fc receptors is considered the primary mechanism of action of immune globulin in persons with ITP and other autoantibody-mediated cytopenias. In persons with Kawasaki disease and dermatomyositis, IVIG is thought to inhibit the generation of membrane attack complexes (C5b-C9) and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage by binding the activated components C3b and C4b, thus preventing their deposition on target surfaces. In persons with dermatomyositis, IVIG induces a decrease in the plasma levels of membrane attack complex and a substantial decrease in the amounts of C3b and membrane attack complex deposited in endomysial capillaries. The high content of anti-idiotypes against autoantibodies in IVIG facilitates its ability to neutralize autoantibodies, as is shown in patients with acquired hemophilia due to autoantibodies against factor VIII.\n [6] \n\nIVIG also has effects on the clearance of opsonized cells. The results of in vitro C3 uptake studies evaluating the effect of IVIG on the clearance of pre-opsonized cells suggest that IVIG produces a kinetic depression of C3 uptake and modifies the process of complement fragment deposition on erythrocytes.\n\nIVIG also contains natural antibodies. Normal serum contains IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, which are referred to as natural antibodies because they are induced without deliberate immunization and are independent of antigenic exposure. They are considered key to the immunoregulatory effects of immune globulin in immune-mediated disorders.\n [6] Natural autoantibodies appear to be more polyreactive than immune antibodies; natural antibodies can frequently bind to different antigens.\n [6] Natural autoantibodies can (1) bind to pathogens; (2) help remove senescent or altered molecules, cells, and tumors; (3) induce remyelination; and (4) inhibit the growth of autoreactive B-cell clones. In the multifocal motor neuropathy disease state, IVIG intercedes to stop complement deposition that is triggered by anti-GM1 antibodies.\n [7] The effect of IVIG could also relate to the presence of natural antibodies. IVIG also contains cytokines, and perhaps neutralizing antibodies; interestingly, antibodies against granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6 in immune globulin have biologic activity in vivo.\n [6] \n\nThe broad range of applications of IVIG shows the importance of immunoglobulins in the immune homeostasis in healthy people.\n\nNoteworthy to remember is that while IVIG replacement prevents severe and lower respiratory tract infections, it does not prevent upper respiratory tract and non-respiratory infections in persons with common variable immune deficiency.\n [8]   The largest challenge faced in 2018 is identifying those persons with specific diseases who will respond to IVIG and what biomarkers might inform apposite therapy.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Intravenous Insulin Therapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nPatients with hyperglycemia in the ICU have increased morbidity and mortality. Hyperglycemia is associated with immune dysfunction, increased systemic inflammation, and vascular insufficiency. Elevated blood glucose levels have been shown to worsen outcomes in medical patients who are in the ICU for more than 3 days. Hyperglycemia may result from stress, infection, corticosteroid therapy, decreased physical activity, discontinuation of outpatient regimens, and nutrition.\n [2] \n\nImproved control of hyperglycemia improves patient outcomes, but clinical confirmation of this thesis has proved elusive. Significant interest was generated by initial single-center results that have not been replicated in multisite studies. A randomized controlled study by van den Berghe et al in a surgical ICU demonstrated a decrease in mortality from 8% to 4.6% in patients with intensive continuous intravenous insulin therapy.\n [3] The authors repeated the protocol in a study of 1200 patients in a medical ICU.\n [4] The conventional treatment group was treated to maintain a blood glucose level between 180 and 200 mg/dL, whereas the intensive treatment group was treated to maintain a blood glucose level between 80 and 110 mg/dL. Mortality was not significantly reduced by intensive insulin therapy and was actually higher in patients in the intensive treatment group who were in the ICU for less than 3 days. In patients who were in the ICU for longer than 3 days, the intensive treatment group did demonstrate reduced morbidity from decreased kidney injury, earlier weaning from mechanical ventilation, and earlier discharge from the medical ICU and hospital. Hypoglycemia occurred more often in the intensive treatment group than in the conventional treatment group. In addition, an experienced physician was actively involved in administration of the protocol, a luxury not uniformly available to many hospitals and a variable that limited the ability to generalize their results to other centers.\n\nHowever, the results were encouraging and represented a marked improvement in several areas, stimulating great interest in tight glucose control with intravenous insulin, which, in turn, stimulated the development of a multitude of intravenous insulin protocols. However, the protocols widely varied, and little uniformity was observed among medical centers. Questions persisted as to the optimal protocol and targets and the need for a unified, uniform approach to control of hyperglycemia.\n\nThe Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation–Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR) study by Finfer et al was a large, international, randomized trial intended to address the shortcomings of previous studies.\n [5] The study enrolled 6104 patients who were assigned to either tight glucose control with a target of 81-108 mg/dL or conventional glucose control with a target of 180 mg/dL or less. At the end of the 90-day study period, mortality was 27.5% of patients in the tight glucose control group and 24.9% of patients in the conventional control group, with an odds ratio of 1.14 for death with tight glucose control. No significant difference in the median length of stay in the ICU or hospital was noted. Severe hypoglycemia was significantly more common with tight glucose control. This experience dampened the routine use of intravenous insulin in the management of critically ill patients; however, continuous intravenous insulin therapy still has a role in this setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Previous\n       \n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Intravenous-to-Oral Switch Therapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nSwitching from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) therapy as soon as patients are clinically stable can reduce the length of hospitalization and lower associated costs. While intravenous medications may be more bioavailable and have greater effects, some oral drugs produce serum levels comparable to those of the parenteral form. Medications involved in switch therapy include antibiotics, analgesics, antipsychotics, and antivirals. Pharmacist-facilitated antimicrobial stewardship initiatives can aid to IV to PO switches.\n [1] Recent studies in 2014 have underscored the cost savings and effectiveness of IV to oral switch therapy.\n [2, 3]   A 2015 study shows that for low risk variates of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection can be switched from IV to PO rapidly.\n [4]  Even IV treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus involving the skin can be shifted to PO therapy in many patients.\n [5] \nEarly switching of intravenous to oral antibiotics is possible, and positive outcomes have been reported in medical wards.\n [6] In addition, a 2008 meta-analysis found that early switching of intravenous to oral antibiotics is possible in moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n [7] In particular, quinolones can be switched effectively and rapidly from intravenous to oral formulations when patients can tolerate medications orally.\n [8] Many doctors continue to not be aware of guidelines for intravenous to oral switches, their thinking complicated by patients with complex problems.\n [9] Nevertheless guidelines can help doctors make the proper decision to do the switch in appropriate patients.\n [10] A useful antibiotic in IV to oral switch is linezolid.\n [11] \n\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia\nOne of the most common uses of intravenous-to-oral (IV-to-PO) switch therapy is in the treatment of CAP. CAP is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The natural history of CAP is beyond the scope of this article; see Pneumonia, Community-Acquired for more information. In terms of switch therapy, approximately 40-50% of patients admitted for intravenous antibiotics can be switched to oral antibiotics within 2-3 days.\n\n\n\n\nThe US Medicare Pneumonia Project database provided evidence that the routine practice of in-hospital observation after the switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics in patients with CAP can be avoided in those who are clinically stable.\n [12] Explicit physiological criteria must be recorded routinely to serve as a benchmark in order for the switch to be consistently successful.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1999, Siegel reported that the treatment of hospitalized patients with uncomplicated CAP is changing to include a brief period of intravenous antibiotics followed by oral therapy.\n [13] The Classification of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CoCAP) is a stratification tool in which patients are categorized as having low-risk pneumonia, unstable pneumonia, or complicated pneumonia (see the image below). Caregivers can achieve a structure for organizing treatment of patients with CAP by using (1) validated hospital admission criteria, (2) the CoCAP algorithm, and (3) newly evolving criteria for switching patients from intravenous to oral therapy.\n\nA Japanese multicenter randomized study of early-switch therapy from intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin to oral garenoxacin in CAP was successful.\n [14] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Classification of Community-Acquired Pneumonia \n\n\nPatients with unstable pneumonia can be discharged early if (1) their metabolic problems have reversed and comorbid conditions have stabilized and (2) they have not developed any serious pneumonia-related complications. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotic therapy are being replaced with 2- to 3-day courses of intravenous hydration and antibiotics; patients can be switched to oral therapy and can be discharged from the hospital after they tolerate one dose of oral therapy. The vital signs and the WBC count should be monitored, and, provided these parameters are improving (although possibly not normalized), patients can be switched to oral therapy.\n\nPatient treatment guidelines and critical pathways are becoming widespread in disease management, and CAP is one disease in which prospective studies have demonstrated that a reduction in hospital stay is safe and agreeable with patients, caregivers, and administrators. Other treatment protocols are being explored, including a single dose of intravenous antibiotic prior to the oral switch and all-oral regimens using the newer fluoroquinolones. A study by Ramirez et al (2005) showed that the care recommended by national guidelines regarding switching from intravenous to oral therapy was not being appropriately delivered to adults with CAP in all regions of the world.\n [15] \n\nDifferent doctors have different approaches to switch therapy. Inpatients with CAP treated by hospital clinicians had a shorter adjusted length of stay than those treated by primary care physicians, primarily because of earlier recognition of stability and more rapid conversion from intravenous to oral antibiotics. Adjusted costs were likewise reduced. However, patients treated by hospital clinicians were more often discharged with an unstable clinical variable. Other than earlier switching to oral antibiotics, less use of clindamycin and ceftazidime, and fewer consultations with infectious disease specialists, the care processes of hospital clinicians were similar to those of primary care physicians.\n [16] \n\nIn 2004, Wawruch et al reported on an evaluation of a group of patients selected out of 2870 patients who were hospitalized at the Clinic of Geriatric Medicine at Comenius University in Bratislava from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2001. In their retrospective study, Wawruch et al analyzed 96 patients with CAP who were successfully treated with antibiotics. Forty-three patients received intravenous antibiotics, and 53 received IV-to-PO switch therapy (ie, intravenous administration was used at the beginning and oral administration was used when their conditions improved).\n [17] \n\nAccording to the cost-effectiveness coefficient, the switch therapy was significantly less expensive in all evaluated antibiotics (except pefloxacin) compared with intravenous administration. For ampicillin-sulbactam, the coefficients were 93.9 versus 168.1, 90 versus 123.3 for cefuroxime, 74 versus 116.3 for amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 31.7 versus 54.1 for ciprofloxacin. Wawruch et al found that timely switching from intravenous to oral administration of antibiotics in suitable patients is an effective way to save financial resources.\n [17] \n\nOosterheert et al (2006), based on a study of 302 patients, found that early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics in patients with severe CAP is safe and decreases the hospital stay by 2 days.\n [18] \n\nPeyrani et al (2006) reported that, in a study involving 40 hospitals in 13 countries, IV-to-PO switch antibiotic therapy among hospitalized patients with CAP did not comply with evidence-based guidelines implemented by The American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n [19] \n\nRhew and associates investigated the effectiveness of early switch and early discharge strategies in patients with CAP by searching the MEDLINE, HealthStar, EMBASE, Cochrane Collaboration, and Best Evidence databases for the period between January 1, 1980, and March 31, 2000, for CAP studies that included specific switch criteria or recommendations to switch on a particular day.\n [20] \n\nRhew et al identified 1794 titles and reviewed 121 articles. They identified 10 prospective, interventional, CAP-specific studies that evaluated length of stay. Nine studies applied an early switch from parenteral to oral antibiotic criteria. Six different criteria for switching were applied in the 9 studies. Five of the studies that applied early-switch criteria also applied separate criteria for early discharge. Six studies applied an early-switch and early-discharge strategy to an intervention and a control group, and 5 of these provided standard deviation values for length of stay.\n [20] \n\nThe mean change in length of stay was not significantly (P = .05) reduced in studies of early switch and early discharge (-1.64 d; 95% CI, -3.3 to 0.02 d). However, when the 2 studies in which the recommended length of stay was longer than the control length of stay were excluded from the analysis, the mean change in length of stay was reduced by 3 days (-3.04 d; 95% CI, -4.9 to -1.19 d). Studies did not reveal significant differences in clinical outcomes between the intervention and control groups. Rhew and colleagues concluded that criteria for early switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics vary considerably for patients with CAP. Early-switch and early-discharge strategies may significantly and safely reduce the mean length of stay when the recommended length of stay is shorter than the actual length of stay.\n [20] \n\nBacterial peritonitis, pyelonephritis, adult septic arthritis\nOther uses of switch therapy can include the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A more cost-effective switch therapy in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis who are not receiving prophylaxis with quinolones involves the use of a cephalosporin rather than intravenous ceftazidime.\n [21] \n\nIn a study of 169 cases of septic arthritis in 157 adults, 12% recurred after intravenous to oral switch. Gram-negative bacteria, immunosuppression, and lack of surgical clearance of the nidus of infection complicated the switch. In most cases, 7 days of intravenous therapy was similar in outcome to 8-21 days. Fourteen days or less has the a similar outcome as 15-28 days or more than 28 days.\n [22] \n\nIn a study of 82 patients with putative pyelonephritis,\n [23] all received 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone initially. After day 3, they were split into 2 groups of 41 one receiving 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone and the other a single daily dose of oral cefditoren pivoxil at 400 mg. Ninety-five percent of the orally treated patients and 100% of those receiving intravenous therapy achieved a clinical cure, with 63.4% of the oral and 60% of the intravenous groups treated achieving bacteriological eradication; no difference was noted in adverse effects between the 2 groups. The authors conclude that this switch is viable, even though the pathogens of pyelonephritis are often quinolone-resistant. Perihepatitis and accute pelvic inflammatory disease treated with intravenous azithromycin switched to oral azithromycin\n\nhas been found effective and practical in Japan.\n [24] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Neuroprotective Agents in Stroke": "\nOverview of Neuroprotective Agents\n\n\nAn ischemic stroke occurs when a cerebral vessel occludes, obstructing blood flow to a portion of the brain (see the image below). Currently, the only approved medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent that targets the thrombus within the blood vessel.\n [1, 2] For more information, see Ischemic Stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\nMIP image from a CTA demonstrates a filling defect or high-grade stenosis at the branching point of the right MCA trunk (red circle), suspicious for thrombus or embolus. CTA is highly accurate in detecting large vessel stenosis and occlusions, which account for approximately one-third of ischemic strokes. \n\n\n\nDespite the availability of thrombolytic therapy, stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and a leading cause of adult disability. To reduce the devastating impact of stroke on society, physicians continue to seek ways to achieve better functional recovery in stroke patients. Neuroprotective agents, another approach to stroke treatment, have generated long-term interest.\nNeuroprotective agents are used in an attempt to save ischemic neurons in the brain from irreversible injury.\n [3] Studies in animals indicate a period of at least 4 hours after onset of complete ischemia in which many potentially viable neurons exist in the ischemic penumbra (ie, the rim of the infarct). In humans, the ischemia may be less complete, and the time window may be longer, but human patients also tend to be older, with comorbidities that may limit benefit.\n\n\n\n\nBecause many neuroprotective drugs reduce ischemic damage in animal models of stroke, this line of pharmaceutical research hold promise despite the lack of efficacy in human models to date. Many investigators are searching for a safe agent that can limit ischemic damage in human stroke.\n\n\n\n\nOne action of neuroprotective agents limits acute injury to neurons in the ischemic penumbra. Neurons in the penumbra are less likely to suffer irreversible injury at early time points than are neurons in the infarct core. Many of these agents modulate neuronal receptors to reduce release of excitatory neurotransmitters, which contribute to early neuronal injury.\n\nOther neuroprotective agents prevent potentially detrimental events associated with return of blood flow. Although return of blood flow to the brain is generally associated with improved outcome, reperfusion may contribute to additional brain injury.\n [4] Returning blood contains leukocytes that may occlude small vessels and release toxic products.\n\nThis article discusses 2 types of neuroprotective agents, one that prevents early ischemic injury and another that prevents reperfusion injury. Clinical trial results of these agents are summarized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Opioid Equivalents and Conversions": "\nOverview\n\n\nA thorough pain assessment is vital to the initial evaluation of a patient and must be performed to guide treatment decisions.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \nDosing may be done incrementally and titrated to analgesic effect. Particularly in those without prior analgesic use, effects are variable and overdosing in these patients can result in adverse events.\n\n\nIndividualize doses based on risk for adverse outcomes, prior effective doses, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and response to therapy.\nImmediate-release opioids are recommended for breakthrough pain.\n\n\n\n\nWhen possible, use the same class of opioid analgesic for long-acting (ie, 24-hour scheduled doses) and short-acting (ie, PRN doses for breakthrough pain) pain relief.\n\n\n\n\nDosing charts are guidelines only.\n\nMost data are reported for opioid-tolerant patients so must be used with caution.\n\nCross-tolerance\nReduce opioid dose by 30-50% to accommodate for unknown cross-tolerance and titrate to goal.\n\nThe wide variation among individuals is multifactorial and poorly understood.\n\nIncomplete cross-tolerance can lead to greater than anticipated potency in a new opioid, even in the same class of analgesic.\n\nMonitor clinical response and adverse effects.\n\nWarning\nRespiratory depression risk is highest in opioid-naïve patients.\n\nMethadone and fentanyl are generally safe and considered good options in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\nAcute pain\nAssess the pain level before initiating therapy.\n\nFor mild pain, the starting regimen should be a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or acetaminophen.\n\nFor moderate pain, an opioid agonist (eg, hydrocodone, oxycodone) can be used. An NSAID or acetaminophen may be used in conjunction, when appropriate.\n\nFor severe pain, a higher potency opioid agonist (eg, hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl) can be used.\n\nChronic nonmalignant pain\nAssess the underlying cause.\n\nPrescribe acetaminophen or NSAIDs.\n\nOpioids may be used, but long-acting formulations are recommended in place of prn dosing. Select formulation based on previous response, adverse effects, and comorbid conditions.\n\nIn 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued recommendations for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. The recommendations included the following\n [6, 7] :\n\n\n\n\n\nNonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for chronic pain. Clinicians should consider opioid therapy only if expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. If opioids are used, they should be combined with nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nBefore starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. Clinicians should continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safety.\n\n\n\n\nBefore starting and periodically during opioid therapy, clinicians should discuss with patients known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy and patient and clinician responsibilities for managing therapy.\n\n\n\n\nWhen starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids.\n\n\n\n\nWhen opioids are started, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when considering increasing the dosage to ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, and should avoid increasing the dosage to ≥90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥90 MME/day.\n\n\n\n\nLong-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. When opioids are used for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate-release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than 7 days will rarely be needed.\n\n\n\n\nClinicians should evaluate benefits and harms with patients within 1-4 wk of starting opioid therapy for chronic pain or of dose escalation. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued therapy with patients every 3 mo or more frequently. If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work with patients to taper opioids to lower dosages or to taper and discontinue opioids.\n\n\n\n\nBefore starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk factors for opioid-related harms. Clinicians should incorporate, into the management plan, strategies to mitigate risk, including considering offering naloxone when factors that increase risk for opioid overdose, such as history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (≥50 MME/day), or concurrent benzodiazepine use, are present.\n\n\n\n\nClinicians should review the patient’s history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or dangerous combinations that put him or her at high risk for overdose. Clinicians should review PDMP data when starting opioid therapy for chronic pain and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, ranging from every prescription to every 3 mo.\n\n\n\n\nWhen prescribing opioids for chronic pain, clinicians should use urine drug testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing at least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs.\n\n\n\n\nClinicians should avoid prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\nClinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment (usually medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone in combination with behavioral therapies) for patients with opioid use disorder.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, the CDC published updated guidelines for prescribing opioids for adults with acute and chronic pain. Highlights of the guidelines are as follows\n [8] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Before initiating opioid therapy, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy.\n         \n\n\n\n          Clinicians should maximize use of nondrug and nonopioid drug therapies, as these are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain and are preferred for subacute and chronic pain.\n         \n\n\n\n          When initiating opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release and long-acting opioids.\n         \n\n\n\n          Clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage when opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain.\n         \n\n\n\n          When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids.\n         \n\n\n\n          Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1-4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid-related harms and discuss risk with patients before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy.\n         \n\n\n\n          When prescribing initial opioid therapy for pain, clinicians should review the patient’s history of controlled substance prescriptions to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at high risk for overdose.\n         \n\n\n\n          For patients with opioid use disorder, clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications.\n         \n\n\nSteps for converting or rotating between opioids\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\nCalculate total mg dose taken in past 24-hours.\n\nDetermine equi-analgesic dose (Table 1).\n\nIf pain is controlled on current opioid, reduce the new opioid daily dose by 25-50% to account for cross-tolerance, dosing ratio variation, and interpatient variability.\n\nIf pain is uncontrolled on the current opioid, increase opioid daily dose by up to 100-125%.\n\nTitrate liberally and rapidly to analgesic effect during first 24 hours.\n\nMonitor for adverse events and effectiveness.\n\nReassess the analgesic effect every 2-3 days.\n\n\nTable 1.

        "Ototopical Antibiotics": "\nOtotopical Advantages\n\n\nIn treating ear infections with antibiotics, topical delivery has a number of advantages over systemic delivery. These advantages include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nA vastly higher concentration of antibiotic can be delivered to the site of infection.\n\n\n\n\nMedications delivered topically have no systemic effects.\n\n\n\n\nTopical delivery allows alteration of the local microenvironment.\n\n\n\n\nOtotopical medications are usually less expensive than comparable systemic medications.\n\n\n\n\nA 0.3% antibiotic solution contains 3000 mcg/mL of antibiotic. For comparison, consider the following commonly accepted middle ear concentrations after oral administration of antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmoxicillin at 90 mg/kg (6-10 mcg/mL)\n\n\n\n\nCefuroxime at 500-mg dose (2-4 mcg/mL)\n\n\n\n\nCefpodoxime at 200-mg dose (1-2 mcg/mL)\n\n\n\n\nClarithromycin at 500-mg dose (2-5 mcg/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven parenteral ceftriaxone, which can deliver an exceptionally high middle ear fluid level (35 mcg/mL), cannot begin to compete with the concentration of antibiotic delivered into the middle ear by topical delivery.\n\n\n\n\nThese high concentrations are pharmacodynamically important for antibiotics known to have a concentration-dependent mechanism of action. Aminoglycosides and quinolones are both concentration-dependent drugs. Consequently, bacteriocidal activity and lethality of bacteriocidal kill is progressively enhanced by the extent to which the delivered concentration exceeds the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Although the MIC of ciprofloxacin for Pseudomonas is reported to be as high as 256 mcg/mL, this level is not the norm. End-point MICs rarely exceed 64 mcg/mL, even for highly resistant Pseudomonas.\n\nConsequently, the concentration of delivered antibiotic, when topical administration is used, is always well above the MIC of the relevant organism. This makes the emergence of bacterial resistance extremely improbable. The possibility for the emergence of resistance seems to be vastly lower when topical routes of administration are used as compared with drugs that are administered systemically.\n\nAn important consequence of the high concentration of antibiotics delivered when topical preparations are used is the recognition that MICs reported by clinical laboratories become irrelevant. The clinical laboratory determination of resistance is based entirely on the drug level that can be achieved by systemic administration. A Pseudomonas organism with an MIC of 8 mcg/mL for ciprofloxacin is considered resistant. Clearly, however, the same organisms are rapidly killed by 0.3% topical solution containing 3000 mcg/mL.\n\nCharacteristic of topical delivery systems is the absence of systemic effects, which is an advantage if no systemic effect is required. Systemic toxicity requires systemic exposure. Consequently, systemic reaction to topical antibiotics is extremely uncommon. Because no appreciable systemic delivery of topically administered agents occurs, the normal flora in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts is not exposed to antibiotics. Topical administration, therefore, avoids selecting for resistant organisms in the upper aerodigestive tract, a common mechanism by which resistant organisms develop and propagate. The absence of systemic delivery is another reason that resistance to topical administration occurs with less frequency than resistance to systemically administered agents.\n\nThe use of topical agents allows for the simultaneous modification of the local microenvironment. The pH of the external auditory canal, for example, is normally slightly acidic. The administration of an antibiotic in an acidic drop helps restore and fortify this normal host defense mechanism.\n\nOtotopical medications are generally less expensive than systemic medications. Although the newer quinolone antibiotic drops are more expensive than some systemic antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, the quinolone drops are much less expensive than systemic quinolones. To compare the cost of amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or erythromycin with these ototopical preparations is not appropriate. These systemic antibiotics have a poor spectrum of activity against otic pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Vaccines: Global Brands and Country Availability": "\nOverview\n\n\nImmunizations are an essential component of modern medicine and are paramount for global health. International immunization programs for children have many vaccines in common but, depending on the region, may vary slightly. For example, most industrialized nations tend to follow similar primary immunization schedules, as opposed to nonindustrialized countries. Geographic location also contributes to variation in immunization schedules by country.\n [1, 2] The choice of specific vaccines can also vary by country (eg, 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine instead of or in addition to the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine).\nAnother consideration relating to global immunization is the use of travel vaccines. This is particularly important, as the number of world travelers, including children, continues to increase. In general, preparation for global travel should include an assessment of the traveler’s current vaccination status. This is imperative in children, as they are more susceptible to microbial infection than adults but less likely to receive pre-travel care. Administration of routine childhood vaccinations (eg, hepatitis, polio, and meningococcal vaccines) is often prioritized over specific travel vaccines, as these diseases are still prevalent in many underdeveloped countries. Specific travel vaccines (eg, typhoid fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis) are the next consideration, as these diseases are endemic in many resource-limited countries.\n [3, 4] \n\n\nThe following tables describe vaccines for children that are used globally. While an important component of immunization programs, a review of influenza vaccines is beyond the scope of this article. However, it is important to note that the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is no longer recommended because of efficacy concerns from past seasons.\n [5, 6] See Pediatric Influenza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Procedural Sedation": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) defines procedural sedation as \"a technique of administering sedatives or dissociative agents with or without analgesics to induce a state that allows the patient to tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining cardiorespiratory function. Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is intended to result in a depressed level of consciousness that allows the patient to maintain oxygenation and airway control independently.\"\n [1] \nThe number of noninvasive and minimally invasive procedures performed outside of the operating room has grown exponentially over the last several decades. Sedation, analgesia, or both may be needed for many of these interventional or diagnostic procedures. Sedation and analgesia introduces an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in addition to the procedure itself. Medications that elicit pharmacologic effects, such as anxiolysis, amnesia, or analgesia, provide patient comfort during various procedures. \n\n\nGuidelines for procedural sedation have been available since 1985 for dentists and pediatricians through their societies.\n [2, 3] They have since expanded to other specialties including emergency medicine.\n [4] In October 2014, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters recommended new guidelines for moderate sedation to guide various practitioners and encourage education and training. The guidelines cover core sedation principles and should be customized to address specific specialty needs.\n [5] An ongoing quality improvement review and implementation of these guidelines are necessary. Hospitals should establish these guidelines for their providers in accordance to their available resources.\n [6] \nThe information described in this article does NOT apply to the following types of patients:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients receiving inhaled anesthetics\n\n\n\n\nPatients receiving analgesia for pain control without sedation\n\n\n\n\nPatients receiving sedation to manage behavioral emergencies\n\n\n\n\nPatients who are intubated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Prophylactic Antibiotic Use in Head and Neck Surgery": "\nOverview\n\n\nProphylaxis with antimicrobials has decreased the high incidence of wound infection after head and neck operations that involve incisions through oral or pharyngeal mucosa. Prophylactic administration of antibiotics can decrease postoperative morbidity, shorten hospitalization, and reduce overall costs attributable to infections.\n [1, 2, 3] \nPrinciples of prophylaxis include providing optimal and effective dosing of antibiotics at the time of wound exposure and effective prophylactic regimens. The regimen should be only be directed against the most likely pathogens. Selecting the antibiotic regimen should largely be based on location of the surgical incision; however, the need to assess for epidemiological factors such as common offending bacteria and their respective susceptibility panels should also be addressed.\n\n\nMany antimicrobials require a single dose given within 60 minutes of skin incision to provide adequate tissue concentration throughout the operation. Additional doses during the procedure are advisable if surgery is prolonged (ie, > 4 h), major blood loss occurs, or an antimicrobial with a short half-life is used. The antibiotics should be discontinued 24 hours after surgery, as the prolonged use of prophylaxis leads to bacterial resistance and increased hospital costs.\n [4] \nThe immunocompetency of the patient should also be evaluated, which includes attentiveness to factors such as history of previous surgery creating scarring, radiation exposure, malnourishment, or HIV infection, among others. However, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus remains controversial in assessing complication risk specific to head and neck surgery. This review therefore highlights the multifactorial nature of administering appropriate and efficacious antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce postsurgical complications.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nSee the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm for use of prophylactic antibiotics in head and neck surgery. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Sedation": "\nOverview\n\n\nOne of the most important goals of clinicians is patient comfort. When patients present to the emergency department (ED), treating the pain and anxiety that accompany the chief complaint are critical to patient satisfaction and quality of care. Nonetheless, clinicians may underuse sedation, usually from a lack of experience or from unchallenged myths regarding its use.\nSedation is the depression of a patient's awareness to the environment and reduction of his or her responsiveness to external stimulation. This is accomplished along a continuum of sedation levels:\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal sedation is equivalent to anxiolysis, that is, a drug-induced relief of apprehension with minimal effect on sensorium.\n\n\n\n\nModerate sedation is a depression of consciousness in which the patient can respond to external stimuli (verbal or tactile). Airway reflexes, spontaneous ventilation, and cardiovascular function are maintained.\n\n\n\n\nDeep sedation is a depression of consciousness in which the patient cannot be aroused but responds purposefully to repeated or painful stimuli. The patient may not be able to maintain airway reflexes or spontaneous ventilation, but cardiovascular function is preserved.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral anesthesia is a state of unconsciousness; the autonomic nervous system is unable to respond to surgical or procedural stimuli.\n\n\n\n\nDissociation, which could be considered a type of moderate sedation, is seen when using medications in the phencyclidine group (eg, ketamine). They cause a disconnection between the thalamoneocortical system and the limbic systems, preventing higher centers from receiving sensory stimuli. Like moderate sedation, airway reflexes, spontaneous ventilation, and cardiovascular function are all maintained.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\nPrior to the administration of medications, clinicians must know the level of sedation required for a given procedure and the appropriate dose of the pharmacologic agent or agents chosen. This determines the equipment that one should have readily available prior to starting the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nIndividual patient response to medications can vary; therefore, the clinician can potentially overshoot the desired level of anesthesia. Clinicians must be prepared for this and should have emergency apparatus available in case problems arise.\n [3] \nThe medications used during sedation typically have additional beneficial effects, as important as sedation. These actions include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnxiolysis - Relief of trepidation or agitation with minimal alteration of sensorium\n\n\n\n\nAmnesia - Lapse in memory for a period of time\n\n\n\n\nAnalgesia - Relief of pain without an altered sensorium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSedatives typically have more than one of these actions, although one may predominate. The ideal sedative would exhibit all of the above qualities; most do not. Medications with different qualities are commonly coadministered to compensate for any shortcomings. For example, midazolam is primarily an anxiolytic with some amnestic qualities that is often mixed with fentanyl, primarily an analgesic. When drugs are used as adjuncts, decreasing the dose of each respective drug is important, so as to decrease the incidence of adverse effects.\n\nThe medications below are presented according to pharmacologic class. In general, these medications are usually given intravenously when used for procedures in the emergency department (ED), with some exceptions for children (for more information, see Pediatrics, Sedation). Compared with other modes of administration, intravenous medications generally have a quick onset, have a predictable drug absorption, and are titratable. The intravenous route is emphasized in the discussion below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

The AC ligaments, comprising the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior ligaments, help with anteroposterior stability and inhibit superior translation. The coracoclavicular ligaments, comprising the trapezoid and conoid ligaments, insert on the coracoid process and provide superior-inferior stability and inhibit AC joint compression.

With aging, the joint space between the acromion and the clavicle narrows, wearing away the meniscal disk in between the joint. The articular disk begins to break down around the second decade of life.\n [1]  Injection of corticosteroid (combined with an anesthetic) into the AC joint is one method of treatment for AC joint injuries or pathology.

        "Allograft Reconstruction of ACL-Deficient Knee": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nMultiple techniques are available for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Controversy certainly exists as to which autograft is best and which methods of placement and fixation should be used. An obvious issue is, What is the better choice when both autografts and allografts are available to the surgeon and patient?\n [1, 2] (See Treatment for a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of autografts and allografts.)\nThe supremacy of free bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft was briefly challenged in the 1970s and 1980 by proponents of artificial ligaments in the form of Gore-Tex and Proplast. Poor experiences with these nontissue substitutes led surgeons to choose other graft materials, including allografts. This trend was accelerated after Jackson and others developed the technique of arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstructions during the mid-1980s.\n [3] \n\n\nInstances exist in which autograft is not available because of multiple reconstructions or combined ligament injuries. In addition, after discussing the advantages and drawbacks of the various graft materials available, patients may choose not to use autograft material. In these situations, other graft sources must be considered.\nThe 2014 guideline on the management of ACL injuries formulated by the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommended that practitioners use either autograft or appropriately processed allograft tissue in patients undergoing ACL reconstructions, on the grounds that the measured outcomes are similar, though with the caveat that these results may not be generalizable to all allografts or all patients (eg, young or highly active patients).\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nThis article deals with the grafts available and is aimed at providing the reader with an increased confidence in choosing from various materials.

However, when the ranges of motion (ROMs) of the ankle and subtalar joints (talocalcaneal and talocalcaneonavicular) are taken together, the complex functions as a universal joint.

In some cases, the ankle joint disorder may be related to extra-articular anomalies, which may be regional (eg, mechanical malalignment in the lower extremity) or systemic (eg, inflammatory arthritis).\nAs the indications for ankle arthroscopy have increased, so has its usage. The availability of modern arthroscopic instrumentation (eg, fiberoptics) and ankle distraction techniques has allowed orthopedic surgeons to manage a growing list of ankle disorders arthroscopically. Surgical procedures of the ankle performed arthroscopically are generally associated with lower morbidity, faster rehabilitation, and better cosmetic results as compared with conventional open surgical methods.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \n\n\nFor example, management of osteochondral defects with autologous cartilage replacement has typically required an open procedure to suture a periosteal patch under which harvested and cultured cells are injected. With current techniques, however, the graft can be placed without the need for a periosteal flap and therefore can be implanted arthroscopically.\n [5] \nIt must be kept in mind that arthroscopy is not a panacea. For instance, whereas it can assist in reduction and internal fixation of ankle and pilon fractures, its role in the treatment of acute ankle fractures is still unclear. Ankle arthroscopy is also useful for treating syndesmosis disruptions, evaluating and treating posterior malleolar fractures of the tibial plafond, and facilitating removal of debris and reduction of talus fractures. Coincidental or concurrent osteochondral lesions can be managed with replacement of fragments or, if this is not feasible, microfracture surgery.  Indications and applications for arthroscopy are still evolving and require further research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

However it was not until 1905, when the Italian physician Pianese reported bone marrow infiltration by the parasite Leishmania, that this procedure was applied to clinical evaluation.\n [1] \nBone marrow consists of stem cells, which are large, \"primitive,\" undifferentiated cells supported by fibrous tissue called stroma. There are two main types of stem cells, and thus, bone marrow consists of two types of cellular tissue. One type of stem cell is involved in producing blood cells, and the other is involved in producing stromal cells, which are responsible for the supporting stroma. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Bone Marrow Anatomy.\n\n\nSampling of the marrow consists of aspiration of the cellular component, acquisition of tissue fragments, or both.

        "Bristow Procedure": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn the Bristow procedure and its variants, the coracoid process is transferred through the subscapularis tendon as a method of treating recurrent anterior instability of the shoulder. The coracoid tip is transferred to the anteroinferior glenoid neck and likely serves as a bone block in front of the humeral head. The transferred short head of the biceps and coracobrachialis are placed so as to produce a strong dynamic buttress across the anterior and inferior aspects of the joint when the shoulder is in the vulnerable abducted and externally rotated position.\n [1] \nHelfet first described the Bristow procedure in 1958 and named it after his late mentor.\n [2] He described a procedure in which the terminal 1 cm of the coracoid and the conjoined tendon were transferred through a horizontal slit in the subscapularis onto the neck of the scapula. The transfer was held in place by sutures through the conjoined tendon and subscapularis.\n\n\nLatarjet described a similar procedure in 1954, in which he transferred the tip of the coracoid along with the conjoined tendon through a horizontal slit in the subscapularis and fixed it with a screw.\n [3] Many other surgeons have described variations of the procedure; however, the common aspect of most current techniques is fixation of the transferred coracoid to the scapular neck with a screw.\nBoileau et al found bony glenoid lesions in 49% of their patients with recurrent instability.\n [4] Loss of glenoid bone can disrupt the glenoid concavity, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the concavity-compression mechanism in stabilizing the shoulder against anterior translation.\n [5] Therefore, patients with recurrent anterior instability and glenoid bone loss may not achieve favorable outcomes with soft-tissue procedures alone. Soft-tissue procedures do not restore the firm glenoid socket that normally resists anterior translation.\n\n\n\n\nPatients are likely to suffer bony involvement at the time of initial dislocation. In the case of acute recurrent instability, identifiable fracture fragments are frequently reported.\n [6] In contrast to acute recurrent instability, patients studied at a mean of 15 months after initial dislocation exhibited erosive bone loss without an identifiable fracture fragment.\n [7] This pattern of bone loss demonstrates a progressive loss of bone over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

By far the most common cause, however, is fracture of a long bone. Fractures of the tibia and forearm bones account for most cases. Compressive dressings and casts can also cause compartment syndrome, as in the first case reported by Volkmann.\n [3] \nCompartment syndrome can occur within any semirigid anatomic space within the body.

The practitioner should choose a heating modality that produces the highest temperature at the site of concern without exceeding the temperature tolerance at the affected site or in tissues above or below that site. The temperature rise depends on the properties of the tissue, including the specific heat, thermal conductivity, and the length of time for which the heating modality is applied.\nThe temperature rise and distribution of heat that are associated with these modalities are superimposed on the physiologic temperature distribution in the tissues prior to diathermy application. Usually, the temperature is low at the skin surface and higher at the core.\n\n\n\n\nThe physiologic effects of temperature occur at the site of the application and in distant tissue. The local effects are caused by the elevated temperature response of cellular function by direct and reflex action. Locally, there is a rise in blood flow with associated capillary dilatation and increased capillary permeability. Initial tissue metabolism increases, and there may be changes in the pain threshold. Distant changes from the heated target location include reflex vasodilatation and a reduction in muscle spasm (as a result of skeletal muscle relaxation).\n\n\n\n\nVigorous heating produces the highest temperature at the site where the therapeutic result is desired. The tissue undergoes a rapid temperature rise, with the temperature coming close to the tolerance level. Vigorous heating is used for chronic conditions that require deep structures, such as large joints, to be heated. When acute inflammatory processes are occurring, deep heating requires extreme care, because it can obscure inflammation.\n\nLocal tissue temperature is maintained during mild heating, the primary effect being the production of a higher temperature at a site distant from the heating modality's application. Reflex vasodilatation occurs when the rise in temperature is slow for short periods, such as during a subacute process. With the proper application, superficial and deep heating methods can accomplish mild heating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Although acquired amputations in children are discussed (because pediatric patients deserve special consideration), patients with congenital limb amputations and deficiencies are beyond the scope of this article.\nThe true frequency of acquired amputation at or above the elbow is unknown.

Archeologists have uncovered evidence of amputation—congenital and acquired through surgery or trauma—in prehistoric humans. Whereas surgical amputation has evolved significantly since the days of quickly severing a limb from an unanesthetized patient and dipping the stump in boiling oil to achieve hemostasis, modern ideas of amputation and prosthetics were not developed until World Wars I and II. Particularly since the late 20th century, prosthetic research and rehabilitation engineering centers supported by federal funding have disseminated new information regarding biomechanics and prosthetic design.\nWith the advent of physical and rehabilitative medicine, surgeons now realize that care for a person who has undergone an amputation does not end with the removal of sutures.\n\n\n\n\nAs medical technology and surgical techniques are improved in the areas of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, microsurgery and limb salvage, it is to be expected that the number of amputations will consequently decrease.

        "Extensor Tendon Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe extensor tendons of the hand are in a relatively superficial position; consequently, they are highly susceptible to injury from lacerations, bites, burns, or blunt trauma. Extensor tendon injuries are commonly diagnosed in the emergency department (ED). Certain injuries can be repaired in the ED,\n [1] whereas others should be repaired by a hand surgeon at a later time in an operating room (OR).\nThe dorsum of the hand, wrist, and forearm are divided into nine anatomic zones to facilitate classification and treatment of extensor tendon injuries. Odd numbers are used for regions overlying articular structures, with even numbers being assigned to the regions between joints, as follows (see the image below)\n [2, 3, 4] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Zone 1 (distal interphalangeal [DIP] joint)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 2 (middle phalanx)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 3 (proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joint)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 4 (proximal phalanx)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 5 (metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joint)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 6 (dorsum of hand)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 7 (wrist)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 8 (distal forearm)\n         \n\n\n\n          Zone 9 (proximal forearm)\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision of dorsum of hand and forearm into anatomic zones. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of extensor tendon injuries may require operative intervention, depending on the complexity of the injury and the zone of the hand involved.\n [5, 6] For treatment of injuries to specific zones of the hand, see Technique. The goal of repair is to restore tendon continuity and function, with a secondary goal of allowing early motion of the injured digit. Optimal preparation and technique are critical for minimizing adhesions and scar tissue formation and ensuring the best possible outcome.\nExtensor tendon injuries are often more difficult to treat than flexor tendon injuries, owing to several issues specific to extensor tendons. The extensor mechanisms of the hand are in a superficial position, not enclosed in tendon sheaths (as flexor tendons are), and often have limited retraction after injury.\n\n\n\n\nExtensor tendons also tend to be thinner and flatter than flexor tendons are, as well as being in very close proximity to bony structures. This leaves them highly susceptible to adhesions and shortening, which can severely impair function and range of motion.\n\nWith injuries that are proximal to the anatomic juncturae tendinum, extensor function may still be preserved distally. Additionally, up to 90% of an extensor tendon can be lacerated and still retain preserved function to gravity, necessitating careful physical examination and wound exploration.\n [7, 4, 8] \n\nExtensor tendon injuries may be iatrogenic as well, occurring either as a consequence of surgical error or as a complication of a previous procedure or medication (eg, a fluoroquinolone). Extensor tendon ruptures following plating of wrist and hand fractures are well documented, including ruptures that have been reported after intramedullary nailing of pediatric forearm fractures.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Numerous techniques are available for the repair of fingertip amputations, with the common goal of reducing pain and preserving sensation at the tip (see Technique).\n [1, 2] The appropriate approach depends on the amount of tissue involved, the involvement of bone (distal phalanx), the angles and levels of amputation, and the involvement of other fingers or the rest of the hand.\n\n\nTechniques discussed in this article are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Open technique (nonoperative; healing by secondary intention)\n         \n\n\n\n          Skin graft\n         \n\n\n\n          Reamputation\n         \n\n\n\n          V-Y flap (Kutler or Atasoy)\n         \n\n\n\n          Volar flap advancement (Moberg)\n          \n [3] \n\n\n\n\n          Bipedicle dorsal flap\n         \n\n\n\n          Crossfinger flap\n         \n\n\n\n          Thenar flap\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nFingertip replantation has become an established technique with the potential to yield excellent outcomes, but it remains technically challenging.\n [4]  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

It has been estimated that in the United States, flexor tendon lacerations cost the medical system $240.8 to $409.1 million annually, with a total direct cost of $13,725 per injury and indirect costs ranging from $60,786 to $112,888 per injury.\n [1] \nEarly repair has evolved as the mainstay of treatment for flexor tendon lacerations.\n [2, 3] There is no firm consensus on the optimal repair technique for injuries in each zone.\n [3, 4] In the setting of a failed early repair or conditions in which early repair is not feasible, a delayed reconstruction remains a viable option to restore function to the affected digit.\n\n\nAs understanding of tendon biology and healing continues to advance, repair techniques and outcomes will also improve. Research is directed toward the development of means by which to limit adhesions and scarring and to promote earlier tendon healing through the use of mesenchymal stem cells, molecular growth factors, and gene therapy.\n [5, 6, 7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "General Principles of Internal Fixation": "\nHistory of Fracture Treatment\n\n\nThroughout history, fractures have been treated with immobilization, traction, amputation, and internal fixation. Immobilization by casting, bracing, or splinting a joint above and below the fracture was used for most long-bone fractures—except femur fractures, for which traction was the mainstay of treatment. In the past, open fractures and ballistic wounds with long-bone fractures were not amenable to standard fracture care because of the associated soft-tissue injury and the difficulty of preventing sepsis; thus, they usually resulted in amputation.\nAlthough the concept of internal fixation dates back to the mid-1800s, Lister introduced open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of patella fractures in the 1860s. Use of plates, screws, and wires was first documented in the 1880s and 1890s. Early surgical fixation initially was complicated by many obstacles, such as infection, poorly conceived implants and techniques, metal allergy, and a limited understanding of the biology and mechanics of fracture healing.\n\n\nDuring the 1950s, Danis and Muller began to define the principles and techniques of internal fixation. Since then, advances in biologic and mechanical science have led to contemporary fixation theories and techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Guillotine Ankle Amputation": "\nBackground\n\n\nGuillotine amputations are performed either for speed or for control of infection before a second, definitive amputation. In guillotine ankle amputation, all of the tissues from the skin to the bone are cut at the level of the ankle without creating flaps of soft tissue.\nAmputation surgery can be definitive if the wound flaps created at the stump can be approximated and no further surgery is anticipated to close the end of the stump. A guillotine amputation, by definition, leaves an open wound at the end of the stump. A further surgical procedure planned as a second stage involves a higher-level amputation to create soft-tissue flaps and provide skin cover over the open end of the stump.\n\n\nThis article describes the circumstances and technique of performing a guillotine amputation at the level of the ankle joint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Hallux Valgus Osteotomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nHallux valgus is a deformity at the base of the big toe, or metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, in which the great toe (hallux) is deviated or points toward the lesser toes; in severe types of the deformity, the great toe goes over or under the second toe.\nThe head of the first metatarsal does not have any musculotendinous attachments. These structures in the great toe bypass the head of the first metatarsal to be inserted into base of the proximal and distal phalanges. When the great toe is in a normal alignment, the tendons and muscle forces exerted around the head and at the first MTP joint are balanced. When there is a malalignment at this joint muscle imbalance gradually worsens the deformity.\n\n\nLong-standing hallux valgus deformity is associated with a contracture in the overpowering lateral musculotendinous structures and stretching of the medial joint capsule. As the deformity increases, the first metatarsal head becomes prominent medially, giving rise to the bunion deformity.\nA number of operative procedures and osteotomies have been devised and or modified over the years. The great variety of procedures and osteotomies underscores the points that not all hallux valgus deformities are similar and that no single osteotomy is versatile enough to treat all such deformities. Therefore, selection of the exact procedure(s) to be employed for operative intervention must be based on careful clinical and radiologic evaluation and planning.\n\n\n\n\nDecision-making requires careful consideration of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          History - Patient age; duration and severity and location of pain; involvement of other joints; response to conservative care; activity level; occupation; expectations\n         \n\n\n\n          Comorbid conditions - Diabetes mellitus; rheumatoid arthritis; gout; stroke; any other underlying spastic neurologic conditions\n         \n\n\n\n          Physical findings - Severity of deformity; presence of bursitis, cellulitis, calluses, rotational deformity, or pronation; passive reducibility of the hallux valgus subluxation or the bunion deformity; hypermobility of the metatarsocuneiform (MTC) and other joints; pes planus; gastrocnemius contracture; neurovascular status\n         \n\n\n\n          Diagnostic imaging - Radiographic evaluation of the hallux valgus; intermetatarsal (IM), interphalangeal (IP), and distal metatarsal articular angles; MTP joint congruity; sesamoid-metatarsal head subluxation; MTC joint congruity or arthrosis; relative lengths of the metatarsals and the parabola at MTP joints 1-5\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

The procedure of intra-articular injection of methylene blue is an easy and safe way to identify disruption of the joint capsule and may facilitate early intervention.\nIntra-articular injection of methylene blue that demonstrates extravasation of dye from the wound site is highly suggestive of open joint injury. In the absence of dye extravasation, open joint injury may still be present; therefore, an orthopedic consultation is recommended for all patients with a suspected open joint injury.\n [1] \n\n\nThe literature is inconclusive in regard to the sensitivity of this procedure for detection of joint-capsule injuries, with reported sensitivities ranging from 31% to 99%.

The catheter, composed of thermal resistive coil, heats the posterior annulus of the disk, causing contraction of collagen fibers and destruction of afferent nociceptors.\nInitial clinical studies suggested that IDET might be effective in approximately 70% of patients with chronic unremitting low back pain. Physical function and quality of life outcomes in highly selected patients have improved. In that IDET is minimally invasive and has a low complication rate, it may offer advantages over surgery.\n [2, 3, 4]  However, its outcomes have not been compared with those of fusion and chronic pain management.

The most common type of intra-articular knee injection is with corticosteroids, but other agents have been used, including infliximab, hyaluronic acid, botulinum neurotoxin, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP).\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \nKnee pain can be broadly categorized. It can result from an intra-articular process such as a ligamentous or meniscal injury or fracture. Knee pain can also result from cartilage loss due to osteoarthritis or synovitis. Tendinopathies and bursitis can cause knee pain, along with inflammatory insults such as inflammatory arthritis or septic arthritis. Knee pain can be caused by patellar malalignment or dysfunction and referred pain from other areas, such as the spine or hip.\n\n\nKnee osteoarthritis can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation and radiographic signs.\n [6]  Baker cysts can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical history and examination and confirmed with ultrasonography (US).\n [7] A clinical presentation consistent with osteoarthritis includes knee joint pain (typically symmetric bilaterally) and morning joint stiffness that resolves within 30-60 minutes and worsens with weightbearing.

Lasers are used in different fields of medicine and confer unique advantages. In the treatment of lumbar disk disease, they are useful and advantageous.\n\n\nThe rapid acceptance of minimally invasive surgery in the United States has occurred in many cases without statistical proof of its superiority over traditional methods. All members of the healthcare field see the need for valid outcome studies supporting the efficacy of new treatment techniques. Whether the benefits of laser spine surgery necessarily outweigh the risks remains controversial.\n [2] To gain wide acceptance, percutaneous laser disk decompression (PLDD) must be demonstrated statistically to be a safe and effective alternative treatment for lumbar disk herniation.\nEpiduroscopic laser neural decompression is considered an effective treatment alternative for chronic refractory low-back or lower-extremity pain, including lumbar disk herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, and failed back surgery syndrome that cannot be alleviated with existing noninvasive conservative treatment.\n [3, 4, 5] \n\n\n\n\nPLDD performed with computed tomographic (CT) and fluoroscopic guidance appears to be a safe and cost-effective treatment for herniated intervertebral disks and is being used with increasing frequency.\n [6, 7] It is minimally invasive, can be performed in an outpatient setting, requires no general anesthesia, results in no scarring or spinal instability, shortens the rehabilitation time, is repeatable, and does not preclude open surgery should that become necessary.\n\n\n\n\nVarious laser wavelengths have been used, but there is no consensus as to which is most efficacious.\n [8] Good candidates for this procedure have a classic clinical syndrome and neuroimaging evidence.\n\nIn cases of ruptured posterior longitudinal ligament (ie, epidural leak of contrast medium in diskography), PLDD is not indicated. Indications for the operation first of all depend on the clinical symptoms, but the success of the operation depends on the diskographic findings.\n\nLaser-assisted posterior cervical foraminotomy with diskectomy is an efficacious surgical option for treating lateral cervical disk herniation.

Minimally invasive TKA (MIS-TKA) is often portrayed in the lay community and press as involving a small skin incision. Actually, MIS-TKA is defined by limited soft-tissue and bony dissection. MIS-TKA was developed after the description of unicondylar knee arthroplasty.\n [1, 2] \nConventional TKA is a successful operation for patients suffering from arthritis of the knee, with a reported complication rate of less than 2% and an implant survivorship of 95% at 10 years.

        "Muscle Biopsy and Clinical and Laboratory Features of Neuromuscular Disease": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe biopsy of skeletal muscle tissue (muscle biopsy), plays an integral role in evaluation of the patient with neuromuscular disease. With some exceptions, it is an essential element in the assessment of a patient with suspected myopathy.\n [1, 2, 3]  Muscle biopsy is also sometimes indicated for the diagnosis of various systemic disorders that can be accompanied by pathology of skeletal muscle tissue. It is also relatively commonly part of the evaluation of suspected neuropathic disease, sometimes for the purpose of assisting the clinician to distinguish a neurogenic disorder with an atypical presentation from a primary myopathic disorder, and in other cases to increase the diagnostic yield when there is a clinical concern that vasculitis might be present.\nThe surgical procedure to obtain a muscle biopsy is relatively simple and poses little risk to the patient. It is, however, a specialized procedure and must be performed properly in order to optimize the information it can yield for the benefit of the patient.\n\n\nThe clinician must first arrive at a rational differential diagnosis by synthesizing information obtained from the clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory and electrodiagnostic studies. This information is used to influence the details of each muscle biopsy procedure. The choices of the right time for biopsy, which muscle to select, how many specimens to obtain, and how to handle the specimen immediately following excision are individualized for each patient on the basis of these clinical features.\nAfter the biopsy specimen arrives in the pathology laboratory, it undergoes multiple procedures and studies. The pathologist uses knowledge of the clinical features to assist in interpretation of the constellation of pathologic findings in the biopsy, as well as to help determine whether additional studies are indicated for a given biopsy on the basis of the composite of the specific clinical features and biopsy findings.\n\n\n\n\nMuscle biopsy, therefore, is somewhat complex, in that an optimal outcome requires coordination of the clinician, surgical team, pathologist, and technical staff in the pathology laboratory. Because muscle biopsies are often processed and interpreted at specialized centers, it may also be necessary to involve a courier service or shipping company in the process.\n\n\n\n\nA portion of this article serves as a primer on the technical aspects of muscle biopsy, which are critical for the success of the procedure. The aim is to help familiarize the reader with the basic concepts of how biopsies should be performed and what happens to the tissue that is obtained, as well as to provide some background information to help nonpathologists understand the pathology reports that they receive.\n\nAn introduction to the clinical features of neuromuscular disease is included in this article (see Clinical Features of Neuromuscular Disorders, below) because knowledge of the clinical history is crucial for correct interpretation of the histologic findings in a skeletal muscle sample, most of which are not by themselves specifically diagnostic. Because muscle biopsy can help determine whether a patient has a neurogenic or a myogenic disorder, which occasionally is an issue that prompts performance of a biopsy, a brief discussion of clinical features and some laboratory findings in peripheral neuropathies is included.\n\nThe section about clinical features of neuromuscular disorders includes a brief discussion of the typical clinical presentation of myopathies and presents some information on the classic clinical presentations of a few different categories of myopathies, with some information about how these disorders are diagnosed.\n\nIt may be instructive to compare the structure and histology of normal skeletal muscle (see Skeletal Muscle - Structure and Histology) with the pathologic alterations observed in muscle (see Skeletal Muscle Pathology). The knowledge gained from this exercise can provide a basis for understanding the pathophysiology of some of these disorders, assist the reader to visualize the effect of disease at the tissue level, and provide insight into the process by which histopathologic diagnoses are formulated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

They occur just proximal to the knee joint, in the terminal 9 cm of the femur between the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction and the femoral condyles.\n [2] \nSupracondylar femur fractures have a bimodal distribution within the population. They present in younger patients as a result of high-energy injuries (eg, from motor vehicle collisions or falls from height). In elderly patients, these fractures are often due to low-energy injury mechanisms (eg, simple falls) because of underlying osteoporosis. Supracondylar femur fractures may propagate proximally into the diaphysis or extend distally in the knee joint. Regardless of injury mechanism, supracondylar femur fractures often require surgical treatment for the restoration of limb alignment and fracture stability.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Although the exact definition of the supracondylar region of the femur is unclear in the pediatric patient, it is often determined by measuring the width of the distal femoral physis, then using that distance to measure proximal to the physis to create a square. This region has been dubbed the supracondylar region of the femur.\n [2, 3] \nAn analysis of data from the Kids' Inpatient Database found that obesity was associated with increased rates of ORIF in children with distal femoral fractures (OR = 2.051, 95% CI, 1.69-3.60). In addition, obese children had significantly increased lengths of stay and complications following treatment.\n [4] \n\n\nVarious studies have described the incidence of distal femur fractures as being in the range of 7-12%.\n [5, 6] These injuries are usually the result of direct trauma to the thigh or knee. It is very important to assess for other associated injuries when presented with a supracondylar femur fracture. Often, patients with these injuries may have pathologic bone from diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta or neuromuscular disease. Also, of utmost importance, with a supracondylar femur fracture in a child younger than 1 year, the physician should be suspicious of child abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pelvic Osteotomy for Acetabular Dysplasia": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nPelvic osteotomy is a means of stabilizing the hip and preventing early osteoarthritis in patients with acetabular dysplasia. The development of the hip socket (acetabulum) during the growth period depends largely on the interstitial growth within the triradiate cartilage. However, the concavity of the acetabulum develops in response to the presence of the spherical femoral head within it. Thus, any abnormality in the position of the femoral head with respect to the acetabulum during the growth period can produce acetabular dysplasia.\n [1, 2, 3] \nMore often than not, the concentric reduction of the subluxated or dislocated hip achieved at an early age takes advantage of the inherent growth of the acetabulum to ultimately obtain a well-developed acetabulum and a congruent hip joint.\n [1] \n\n\nSome dysplasias of the acetabulum may persist until adolescence. Although the true incidence of persistent or residual acetabular dysplasia is unknown, it is well established that persistent acetabular dysplasia can lead to early degenerative joint disease.\n [4, 5]  Emphasis is therefore placed on early recognition and timely treatment of persistent acetabular dysplasia by means of an appropriately selected pelvic osteotomy before any irreversible cartilage damage occurs.\n [6] \nPelvic osteotomy is a powerful surgical tool for realigning the dysplastic acetabulum and providing a biomechanically sound hip joint with essentially normal bearing surfaces. The goal is to preserve the natural bone and obviate the need for hip joint arthroplasty at a young age. Each type of pelvic osteotomy has its place, and each has its own advantages, disadvantages, and potential complications.\n\n\n\n\nSelection of the proper pelvic osteotomy is the critical step in treatment. It depends on various factors, such as maturity of the triradiate cartilage, underlying disease and precise pathoanatomy of the hip joint in a particular case. The results of pelvic osteotomy are generally good, with remarkably durable restoration of the hip joint—provided that sufficient attention is paid to the indications for and the technical details of each particular osteotomy.\n\n\n\n\nBy introducing the periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) and the concept of femoroacetabular impingement, Ganz et al\n [7, 8, 9]  greatly changed the thinking of many surgeons involved in treating adolescents and adults with hip joint pathology requiring surgical treatment. Technical advancements in imaging are also helping practitioners detect and treat the degenerative process at a much earlier stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Most biopsies can be performed with local anesthesia, with conscious sedation added if necessary.\nVarious imaging modalities can be used to target the lesion, including computed tomography (CT),\n [3] fluoroscopy,\n [4] ultrasonography (US),\n [5] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n [6] The procedure is safe, with major complications uncommonly reported.

The symptoms are commonly seen in patients with other inflammatory conditions and in patients who sit for most of their work day.\nThe pain usually begins when the piriformis muscle becomes taut, tender, and contracted. This process causes a deep aching sensation in the midgluteal region that is sometimes associated with pain radiating down the posterior leg or up to the lower back. The tight piriformis may cause a nerve and vessel entrapment syndrome as a consequence of its close proximity to the sciatic nerve and surrounding vessels.\n\n\nPiriformis syndrome may constitute as many as 6-8% of low back pain conditions associated with sciatica.\n [1] Some patients experience symptoms in all five toes (multiple dermatomes) rather than in either lateral toes (S1 radiculopathy) or medial toes (L5 radiculopathy), as is generally the case in patients with herniated lumbar discs. The straight-leg raise (SLR) test is generally negative. Pain in the gluteal area is the predominant symptom. Numbness or weakness is rare.\n [2] \nPiriformis syndrome is frequently a diagnosis of exclusion. Before the diagnosis is made, other causes of gluteal, hip, and leg pain must be ruled out (see Periprocedural Care).

        "Reduction of Ankle Dislocation": "\nBackground\n\n\nDislocation of the ankle usually occurs with fractures of the malleoli or of the posterior aspect of the tibia because the ankle’s ligamentous structures are, in most cases, stronger than the osseous architecture.\n [1, 2] In addition to a strong association with fractures,\n [3] ankle dislocations are often open because of the thin layer of tissue that lies over the malleoli. Posterior dislocation of the talus is the most common form of ankle dislocation, though medial, anterior, lateral, and superior dislocations have been well described.\nIndividuals at increased risk for ankle dislocation injuries include those with a history of prior ankle fractures, ankle sprains, weakness of the peroneal muscles, malleolar hypoplasia, or ligamentous laxity such as may occur with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other connective tissue disorders.\n\n\nAn ankle dislocation represents a high-force traumatic injury that often occurs in vehicular collisions or sports that involve jumping. The clinician must, therefore, examine the patient thoroughly for additional injuries.\nThe energy of the traumatic insult usually either forces the ankle into a position of plantarflexion or strikes the ankle while it is already in a resting position of plantarflexion. Once in plantarflexion, all capsular ligaments of the ankle (with the exception of the posterior talofibular ligament) are stretched and, therefore, more susceptible to structural failure. In addition, plantarflexion brings the smaller surface area of the posterior edge of the talus into the mortise of the ankle, which makes translational forces on the talus more likely to dislodge it from the joint.\n\n\n\n\nInjuries that cause subsequent inversion of the ankle lead to posteromedial displacement and tears in the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. Eversion injuries are more likely to produce lateral dislocations and rupture of the talotibial ligament and medial joint capsule. Inversion injuries are more common as a result of axial loads from falls from significant height.\n\n\n\n\nThe rupture of the ankle’s capsular structures is often severe, and the risk of infection secondary to open injury is often significant; however, prompt reduction and, when warranted, operative debridement and repair usually lead to excellent functional recovery and long-term prognosis. Immediate recognition and early reduction of the dislocated ankle are essential, in that delayed reduction may lead to subsequent loss of range of motion (ROM) and increased morbidity.\n\nEvaluation of the ankle injury must sufficiently demonstrate that the dislocation is of the ankle joint; subtalar dislocations may have presentations similar to those of dislocated ankles but are reduced with a different method.\n [4, 5] Applying the ankle reduction technique to a subtalar dislocation may lead to further injury and morbidity, and the two injuries may be clearly differentiated from each other radiographically. In addition to aiding in initial diagnosis, radiography helps to identify the anatomy of the fractures associated with ankle dislocations and should be performed both before and after reduction.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

The presence of disruption of the tight triangular relation of the tip of the olecranon with the distal humeral epicondyles, when the injured elbow is compared with the unaffected side, can help to confirm the diagnosis clinically.\n\n\nInjured structures include the anterior and posterior bands of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments of the elbow, along with, at times, the brachialis muscle, the flexor-pronator muscle group, and articular cartilage.\n [4]  The ipsilateral upper extremity should be examined for other injuries as well, particularly shoulder and wrist fractures and disruption of the distal radioulnar joint. The elbow should be inspected for crepitus, which is an indicator of fracture.\nOf note, the ulnar nerve, median nerve, and brachial artery can be compromised.\n [5]  Therefore, assessing distal neurovascular status is crucial to determine the need for immediate reduction. Injury to the median and ulnar nerves is typically the result of stretch, entrapment, or severance. Brachial artery injury, though possible in any type of dislocation, is frequently seen in open dislocations. Vascular compromise can be caused by brachial artery injury or compression and may be delayed in presentation as a result of hematoma formation or soft-tissue swelling.

        "Reduction of Posterior Hip Dislocation": "\nBackground\n\n\nHip dislocations, regardless of their etiology, are orthopedic emergencies that require immediate diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment.\n [1, 2] The adult hip joint is remarkably stable. It is reinforced with thick capsular and labral structures. The presence of a dislocation injury indicates a large force from a traumatic mechanism (a traction force ≥90 lb [~40 kg]) or the existence of underlying pathology leading to inherent instability of the joint. Posterior dislocations make up 80-95% of traumatic hip dislocations.\nIn the presence of a large force injury, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) measures may have to be initiated in the initial assessment of the patient. Pediatric hip dislocations may occur with smaller amounts of force\n [3] and have been documented after gymnastic maneuvers and falls from standing. Elderly patients or those with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Down syndrome are also more likely to dislocate a hip with smaller amounts of traumatic force.\n\n\nPosterior traumatic hip dislocations occur when the force acts with adduction, internal rotation, and some degree of flexion of the hip. The incidence of this injury has increased as a consequence of high-velocity motor vehicle use.\n [2] Injuries in which the front-seat passengers are involved in a head-on collision that drives the dashboard into their lower extremities (ie, dashboard injuries) have become a notorious cause of posterior traumatic hip displacement. This mechanism of injury is associated with an incidence of simultaneous severe knee injury in 26% of patients, including patellar fractures in 4% of patients.\nThe increasing popularity of extreme sports has also led to an increase in hip dislocations. One study showed that snowboarders are more likely than skiers to experience hip dislocations.\n [4] The difficulty in detecting a knee injury in a patient who has a dislocated hip underscores the need for the clinician to maintain a high index of suspicion for multiple lower-extremity injuries (eg, acetabular and femoral head, neck, or shaft fractures) as well as occult visceral damage. A review by Onche et al highlighted the high rate of other extremity injuries associated with hip dislocations.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nPosterior hip dislocations are also seen after total hip arthroplasty. Relatively minor forces, such as flexing the hip to pick an item up from the floor, can result in postoperative hip dislocation. Several studies\n [6, 7]  have indicated that slight alterations in surgical technique (eg, slightly larger femoral head and slightly less acetabular component anteversion) may decrease postoperative dislocation rates.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that the ultimate morbidity increases as the time interval from injury to reduction increases.\n [8, 9] Complications such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head, arthritic degeneration of the hip joint, and long-term neurologic sequelae become more likely as reduction is delayed. Whereas the goal is to perform an adequate reduction as quickly as possible, careful prereduction evaluation must be performed to properly diagnose the injury. If adequate closed reduction cannot be attained or if a nerve palsy becomes apparent after closed reduction is achieved, emergency operative reduction is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Reduction of Radial Head Dislocation": "\nBackground\n\n\nDislocation of the radial head can be congenital, related to underlying disease, or traumatic. In the emergency department (ED), most patients with acute radial head dislocations are men who have sustained a high-force injury.\n [1]  These dislocations typically are due to external rotational stress on the ulna.\n [2] Forearm fractures and dislocations, especially in children, are often misjudged, and it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for these injuries in patients presenting after elbow and arm trauma.\n [3] \nIn children, the radial head is much more commonly subluxated than it is dislocated. (See Reduction of Radial Head Subluxation.)\n\n\nIsolated radial head dislocations are exceedingly rare.\n [4] Some argue that they do not even exist and believe that radial head dislocations occur only with disruption of the ulna, including \"plastic deformation\" (described as Monteggia equivalents in children; see below).\n [5]  More commonly, radial head dislocations are complicated by complete elbow dislocations or fractures, as in the Monteggia complex (see below).\nRadial head dislocations may be seen in association with the rare isolated interosseous membrane injury of the forearm or in association with an Essex-Lopresti injury (fracture of the radial head with concomitant dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and disruption of the interosseous membrane).\n [6, 7] Radial head dislocations have also been rarely seen with associated humeral condyle fracture.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\nThe radial head can be congenitally dislocated in isolation or in conjunction with other congenital abnormalities, such as those in Steel syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, nail-patella syndrome (hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia), autosomal dominant omodysplasia, multiple hereditary exostosis, multiple cartilaginous exostosis, mesomelic dysplasias, radioulnar synostosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteochondromas, and achondroplasia.\n [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] \n\n\n\n\nRadial head dislocations have also arisen from complications of osteomyelitis, osteochondromatosis, brachial plexus birth palsy, and arteriovenous malformations that cause osteolysis.\n [11, 21, 22, 23, 24] \n\nTraumatic radial head dislocations are most often seen with associated fractures. Monteggia clinically noted and described the combination of radial head dislocation and proximal ulnar fracture in 1814, before formal radiography was available.\n [25] More than a century later, Bado\n [26, 27] further classified the Monteggia injury into four types on the basis of the angulation of the fracture and the direction of dislocation.\n [28, 29] \n\nThe Bado classification (see Table 1 below) is useful descriptively but not prognostically. \"Monteggia equivalents\" are occasionally seen in children and involve dislocations of the radial head with plastic bowing of the ulna.\n [30] \n\n\n\nTable 1.

Reduction of the subluxated radial head is easily performed in the ED, and complications are rare.\nSubluxation of the radial head is a minor soft-tissue injury that has a peak incidence in children aged 2-3 years and generally affects children younger than 6 years.\n [1] Although occurrence outside this population is uncommon, radial head subluxation does occur in patients younger than 6 months, as well as in older children and even adults.\n [2] \n\n\nSubluxation of the radial head typically results from a quick pull on a child’s arm (see the image below).\n [3] Often, this occurs when a child is holding hands with a caregiver who lifts the child by the arm or tries to prevent a fall. Parents therefore may provide a history of a fall preceding the injury. Frequently, however, caregivers are unsure what caused the injury because the causative mechanical force can be minor or even trivial.\n [4] Rarely, underlying musculoskeletal abnormalities may precipitate a subluxation.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\nSubluxation of radial head occurs after longitudinal traction is placed on pronated extended arm. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Reduction of Shoulder Dislocation": "\nBackground\n\n\nShoulder dislocation is the most common large-joint dislocation seen in the emergency department (ED). The muscular, ligamentous, and bony anatomy of the shoulder (glenohumeral joint) gives it the most extensive range of motion (ROM) of any joint in the human body. However, this anatomy also makes the glenohumeral joint the most unstable joint in the body.\nAnterior dislocations (in which the humeral head is displaced anteriorly in relation to the glenoid), account for as many as 95-98% of shoulder dislocations.\n [1] The reason is that the muscular and ligamentous support anterior to the humeral head is much less robust than the substantial muscular and bony support afforded posteriorly by the rotator cuff and scapula. Anterior shoulder dislocations may be divided into the following four types:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Subcoracoid (most common)\n         \n\n\n\n          Subglenoid\n         \n\n\n\n          Subclavicular (rare)\n         \n\n\n\n          Intrathoracic (rare)\n         \n\n\n\nPosterior shoulder dislocations are considerably less common, accounting for fewer than 4% of shoulder dislocations. Many posterior shoulder dislocations are initially missed by treating physicians, and diagnosis is delayed in many cases.\n [2] Failure to diagnose and treat posterior dislocations promptly can result in complications, including recurrent dislocations, avascular necrosis of the humeral head, degenerative disease, and chronic pain.\n\n\n\n\nInferior glenohumeral dislocation (luxatio erecta humeri) is rare, accounting for fewer than 1% of all shoulder dislocations.\n [3, 4] Most cases arise from forceful hyperabduction of the shoulder. This initially results in impingement of the humeral head against the acromion, and the leverage caused by this impingement ultimately drives the humeral head downward, causing it to disrupt the inferior portion of the glenohumeral capsule and dislocate. Forceful, direct axial loading of an abducted shoulder can also result in luxatio erecta.\n [5, 6] \nMost shoulder dislocations are straightforward and can easily be reduced in the ED by using one of several techniques. However, recalcitrant cases do occur, and clinicians need to be alert for coincident injuries and complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Reduction of Thumb Dislocation": "\nBackground\n\n\nDespite the inherent stability of the joints of the thumb, the vulnerable anatomic position of the first phalanx often subjects the joints to mechanical strain that leads to subluxation or dislocation of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints. (See the image below.) These and other thumb injuries are particularly common in athletes.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomic locations of joints of thumb. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nThe MCP joint of the thumb is a condyloid joint that has a structurally stronger capsular ligament apparatus than the other four MCP joints of the hand do.\n [2] Most thumb MCP dislocations are dorsal.\n [3] They are caused by a longitudinal and dorsal stress along the axis of the digit that hyperextends the thumb and tears the volar plate of the joint. An example of this mechanism is a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) with an impact to the tip of an extended thumb.\nVolar dislocation of the MCP joint of the thumb is comparatively rare and is associated with tears of both dorsal capsule ligaments and the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB).\n [4] For this reason, anterior dislocations are often treated with surgical repair of the torn structures,\n [5] and closed reduction is rarely achieved with adequate postreduction stability.\n\n\n\n\nPlain film radiography is the definitive diagnostic modality for joint dislocations of the thumb, serving both to describe the geography of the dislocation and to rule out the possibility of coexisting fractures.\n\n\n\n\nIntra-articular fractures should be excluded by means of radiology before an attempt is made to reduce a joint in the thumb. These fractures include the Bennett fracture or oblique fracture through the base of the first metacarpal with dislocation of the radial portion of the articular surface.\n [6, 7] The Rolando fracture is similar to the Bennett fracture, except that the fracture at the base of the metacarpal is comminuted with similar dislocation of the fragments.\n\nDislocation of the IP joint occurs to a much lesser extent than dislocation of the MCP joint does. These injuries are most commonly dorsal and are often associated with disruption of the overlying skin and soft tissues.\n\nAlthough rare cases of multiple simultaneous thumb joint dislocations, including the IP, MCP, and proximal carpometacarpal (CMC) or trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joints, have been reported in the literature, most thumb dislocations involve only a single joint.\n [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]  The existence of multiple thumb joint dislocation injury underscores the necessity of careful radiographic analysis before reduction attempts are made.\n [15] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

In assessing the etiology of the low back pain, a complete history, physical examination, psychosocial evaluation, and appropriate imaging may be helpful. Various clinical tests specific to the SI joint during the physical examination have been documented in aiding the diagnosis of SI pain.\nBy using SI anesthetic blocks for diagnosis, the SI joint has been shown to be a source of pain in 10-27% of suspected cases of chronic low back pain.\n [1]  Patients with medical conditions such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Marie-Strumpell or ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, fracture, malignancy, congenital deformity, or infection can also develop pain in the SI joint.\n\n\nPregnant women are at risk for SI joint pain because pregnant women produce a hormone called relaxin, which causes excess motion at the SI joint.\n [2]  Patients with a leg length discrepancy can also develop SI joint pain.\n [3]  In addition, any condition that limits weightbearing (eg, history of surgery on a limb or pain in the lower extremity) may cause SI joint pain because of the uneven distribution of weightbearing during the gait cycle.\n [3]  Patients who have undergone prior spinal surgery may also have increased SI joint pain.\n [4, 1] \n Injection of the SI joint (see Technique) can be either diagnostic or therapeutic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Broadly, shoulder arthroplasty encompasses surgeries using hemiarthroplasty (humeral prosthesis without replacement of the glenoid), total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA; humeral prosthesis with glenoid resurfacing via prosthesis), and reverse total shoulder replacement (humeral cup prosthesis with glenosphere implantation).\n [1, 2, 3] \n\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders account for a high percentage of US healthcare expenditures and are the largest cause of disability.\n [4] Nearly 10% of adults report experiencing shoulder pain, which makes the shoulder the second most common joint for chronic pain.\n [4]  Although much less common than lower-extremity arthroplasties, shoulder arthroplasties have grown at annual rates between 6% and 13%.\n [5] Approximately 53,000 shoulder replacement procedures are performed annually in the United States.\n [6]  Between 2000 and 2010, there was a 1.9-fold increase in the number of hemiarthroplasties performed in the United States.\n [7]  \nThe first shoulder arthroplasty, performed in 1893, is credited to the French surgeon Jules Emile Péan, who inserted a platinum-and-rubber implant into a patient who had glenohumeral destruction secondary to tuberculosis and refused amputation.\n [8] It is Charles Neer, however, who is credited with pioneering modern shoulder arthroplasty. Dr Neer originally designed the humeral head prosthesis for the treatment of fractures about the humeral head and later went on to describe shoulder arthroplasty in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nNumerous shoulder prostheses have evolved since their introduction in the early 1950s, with the most current prostheses being modular systems made of cobalt-chrome alloy. Options offered by modern humeral prostheses include varying sizes of head length and diameter to match patient anatomy and facilitate soft-tissue balancing, varying stem lengths, smooth or coated stems, and cemented or cementless humeral component stems. The specific humeral components employed are dependent on the surgical indications, the patient's anatomy, and the surgical history.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nSubsequent advances by Jon JP Warner, Chief of the Shoulder Service in the Boston Shoulder Institute at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), have helped further improve shoulder arthroplasty by emphasizing innovation and healthcare economics.\n [4, 11, 12] Dr Warner is a pioneer in virtual patient-specific planning and value-based care in shoulder surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Shoulder Subacromial Injection": "\nBackground\n\n\nImpingement syndrome and rotator cuff disorders are common causes of shoulder pain.\n [1]  These conditions are difficult to differentiate clinically. Both are chronic, painful conditions that result from inflammation, damage, or both to the structures that lie within the subacromial space (including the subacromial bursa and the rotator cuff tendons).\nThe two conditions are treated in the same manner initially. Nonoperative treatment should begin with measures to reduce pain and inflammation, including activity modification, modalities, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n [2]  If this is not effective, some patients may benefit from a subacromial corticosteroid injection.\n\n\nCorticosteroid injections can decrease inflammation and improve function,\n [3]  thereby permitting improved range of motion (ROM) and facilitating rehabilitative and strengthening exercises.\n [4]  In general, subacromial injection with corticosteroids should not be performed more than four times per year. Combining such injections with exercise may enhance their effectiveness.\n [5] \nThe accuracy of a blind anatomic approach to subacromial steroid injections has been a subject of investigation. In a small study that employed a mix of depot methylprednisolone and iopamifodol (a radiographic contrast medium), followed by radiographic assessment 6 weeks later to determine intra-or extra-articular placement of the steroid, only two of the 20 patients who received shoulder steroid injections were found to have intra-articular placement.\n [6]  Radiologic placement was uncertain for 12 of the 20, and the remaining six were found to have extra-articular placement. Another study found the blind approach to be only 29% accurate for subacromial bursa injections.\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nUltrasonographic (US) guidance may improve the accuracy of the injection. A randomized controlled clinical trial showed US-guided injections to be substantially more accurate (63%) than blind injections (40%).\n [8] \n\n\n\n\nA study by Lee et al tested botulinum toxin type B for subacromial injections and concluded that injections with this agent may be an alternative to steroid injections.\n [9] \n\nIn a study of 40 patients with shoulder impingement syndrome with findings of rotator cuff tendinitis or subacromial bursitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), three 20-mg injections of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) tenoxicam at weekly intervals yielded results comparable to those of a single 40-mg injection of methylprednisolone acetate.\n [10] \n\nHowever, a study comparing single-dose subacromial injections of betamethasone (7 mg) and lornoxicam (8 mg) in 70 patients with subacromial impingement syndrome found that whereas the patients in the NSAID group achieved rapid functional recovery that partially extended into the intermediate term, the results were inferior to those seen in the steroid group.\n [11] The authors suggested that a single lornoxicam injection may be an alternative only in cases where corticosteroids are contraindicated.\n\nInjection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has also been employed for rotator cuff disease. In a study by Shams et al that included 40 patients with symptomatic partial rotator cuff tears, PRP injection yielded better early results than corticosteroid injection, though after 6 months, there was no longer a statistically significant improvement.\n [12] A study by von Wehren et al found similar results.\n [13]  PRP injection has been employed for other shoulder conditions as well.\n [14] A study by Haider et al found this measure to be useful for reducing pain associated with adhesive capsulitis.\n [15] \n\nA randomized clinical trial by Atar et al compared three-time ozone (O2-O3) injection (n = 22) with one-time US-guided subacromial corticosteroid injection (n = 22) in patients with chronic supraspinatus tendinopathy, of whom 40 completed the study.\n [16]  Both the groups showed clinically significant improvements with respect to shoulder pain, quality of life, and function.

Additionally, increased cutaneous blood flow from superficial heating causes a cooling reaction as it removes the heat that is applied externally.\n\n\nIn general, the transfer of heat (whether the purpose is heating or cooling) often is classified into three general types of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and conversion.\n [1, 2]  They are characterized as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Conductive heating - This is defined as heat transfer from one point to another without noticeable movement in the conducting medium; typically, direct contact takes place between the heat source and the target tissues; superficial heat is usually conductive heat (eg, hot water baths, hot packs, electric heating pads, warm compresses)\n         \n\n\n\n          Convective heating - This form of heating is produced by the movement of the transferring heating medium, usually air or a fluid; methods for providing convective superficial heat include Fluidotherapy (DJO Global, Guildford, UK), whirlpool, moist air baths, and hot air baths\n         \n\n\n\n          Conversion heating - This involves the conversion of one energy form (eg, light, sound) into another (heat); superficial heat is produced by heat lamps or radiant light bakers, with heat being transferred when the conveying medium (light energy) is converted to heat energy at the skin surface\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nSuperficial heat modalities categorized by primary heat transfer mode are summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Conduction - Hot pack, paraffin bath\n          \n [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \n\n\n\n\n          Convection - Fluidotherapy, hydrotherapy, moist air\n          \n [8, 9] \n\n\n\n\n          Conversion - Radiant heat\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral factors determine the extent of the physiologic response to heat, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Tissue temperature (usually 40-45ºC)\n         \n\n\n\n          Duration of the tissue temperature increase\n         \n\n\n\n          Rate of increase in the tissue temperature\n         \n\n\n\n          Size of the area being treated\n         \n\n\nTherapeutic cold (cryotherapy)\nCryotherapy has the primary effect of cooling tissue.\n [1, 10, 11, 12]  Depending upon the application method and duration of this therapy, the basic physiologic effects include the following\n [13] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Decreased local metabolism\n         \n\n\n\n          Vasoconstriction\n         \n\n\n\n          Reactive hyperemia\n         \n\n\n\n          Reduced swelling/edema\n          \n [14] \n\n\n\n\n          Decreased hemorrhage\n         \n\n\n\n          Reduced muscle efficiency\n         \n\n\n\n          Analgesia secondary to impaired neuromuscular transmission\n         \n\n\n\n          Pain reduction associated with the application of cold, which relaxes muscle spasm and minimizes upper motor neuron spasticity\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

This disease entity also is referred to in the literature as bacterial, suppurative, purulent, or infectious arthritis. Septic arthritis usually is divided into gonococcal arthritis and nongonococcal arthritis; clinical and treatment regimens for the two types differ.\n [3] \nThe age range of those affected is broad, extending from the neonatal period to advanced age.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  In adults, septic arthritis most commonly affects the knee; in children, infection into the hip joint predominates.\n [6, 11, 12, 13]  Septic arthritis in neonates and infants can be especially treacherous as a result of blunted inflammatory signals or confounding infection at a distant site (eg, an ear or an umbilical catheter site).\n [14] \n\n\nDespite advances in diagnostic studies, powerful antibiotics, and early drainage, significant joint destruction commonly occurs.\n [15]  Septic arthritis can also cause many complications, including osteomyelitis, bony erosions, fibrous ankylosis, sepsis, and even death.\nTreatment consists of a combined medical and surgical approach.\n [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]  On a macroscopic level, controversy still abounds as to which surgical drainage procedure serves the patient best. Barriers to successful management include lack of clinical suspicion in the early phase of presentation, delay in definitive diagnostic needle aspiration, and failure to provide adequate drainage of the joint.\n\n\n\n\nFor patient education resources, see the Arthritis Center, as well as Knee Pain.\n\n\n\n\nPathophysiology\nCollins et al found that synovial fluid TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1) expression is increased in septic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n [23]  According to the authors, in patients with acute inflammatory arthritis, elevated synovial fluid TREM-1 levels may help point to a diagnosis of septic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, targeting TREM-1 may provide therapeutic benefit by reducing local proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine release.\n\nPessler et al, in an analysis of the synovium in patients with chronic pyogenic arthritis, identified extensive neovascularization and cell proliferation, persistent bacterial colonization, and heterogeneous inflammatory infiltrates rich in CD15+ neutrophils.\n [24] \n\nFuture research will focus on targeting bacterial factors and immunologic factors that worsen infection.\n [25]  For example, aside from the excessive amount of pus (and pressure) created by Staphylococcus, the organism also produces staphylokinase, which helps destroy cartilage further.

        "Tendon Transfer Principles and Mechanics": "\nGeneral Principles of Tendon Transfer\n\n\nCertain key elements play crucial roles in tendon transfer operations.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] The following three important principles should be emphasized\n [7] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          The transfer should not significantly decrease the remaining function of the hand\n         \n\n\n\n          The transfer should not create a deformity if significant return of function occurs following a nerve repair\n         \n\n\n\n          The transfer should be phasic or capable of phase conservation\n         \n\n\n\nFor more information on tendon transfer in the hand, see Hand Tendon Transfers.\nFundamental principles of muscle-tendon units include the following.\n\n\n\n\nCorrection of contracture\nIn any patient with peripheral nerve palsy, all joints must be kept supple because soft-tissue contracture is far easier to prevent than it is to correct. Maximum passive motion of all joints must be present before a tendon transfer because no tendon transfer can move a stiff joint.\n\n\n\n\nAdequate strength\nThe tendon chosen as a donor for transfer must be strong enough to perform its new function in its altered position. Selecting an appropriate motor is important because a muscle will lose one grade of strength following transfer. It is vital not to transfer muscle that has been reinnervated or muscle that was paralyzed and has returned to function.\n\nAmplitude of motion\nThe amplitude of tendon excursion must be considered for each muscle. A wrist flexor with an excursion of 33 mm cannot substitute fully for a finger extensor with an amplitude of 50 mm. Although the true amplitude of a tendon cannot be increased, its effective amplitude can be augmented in either of the following two ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n          The natural tenodesis effect can be used by converting a muscle from monoarticular to biarticular or multiarticular\n         \n\n\n\n          Extensively dissecting a muscle from its surrounding fascial attachments can increase amplitude\n         \n\n\nStraight line of pull\nIn the most effective transfer, the muscle passes in a direct line from its origin to the insertion of the tendon being substituted. Although not always possible, this configuration is desirable.\n\nOne tendon, one function\nA single tendon cannot be expected to simultaneously perform diametrically opposing actions (eg, flexing and extending the same joint). If a muscle is inserted into two tendons with separate functions, the force of amplitude of the donor tendon is dissipated and less effective than that of a muscle motored by a single tendon.\n\nSynergism\nThe use of synergistic muscles (eg, finger flexors acting in concert with wrist extensors and finger extensors with wrist flexors) has been advocated for transfer. Muscle function is easier to retain after synergistic muscle transfer.\n\nExpendable donor\nThe removal of a tendon for transfer must not result in an unacceptable loss of function. Sufficient muscle must remain to substitute for the donor muscle.\n\nTiming of tendon transfer\nNo transfer should be performed until the local tissues are in optimal condition. The term often used to describe this is tissue equilibrium. Tissue is in equilibrium when soft-tissue induration has resolved, when any reaction in the wound is absent, when joints are supple, and when the scars are as soft as they are likely to become.\n\nTendon transfers function best when passed between subcutaneous fat and the deep fascial layer; they are not likely to be functional if placed in the pathway of a scar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Thumb Injection": "\nBackground\n\n\nDe Quervain tenosynovitis was first described by Swiss physician Fritz de Quervain, in 1895, in a series of case reports.\n [1, 2]  This common condition is caused by inflammation of the tendons in the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. The tendons involved are the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons (see the image below).\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst dorsal compartment of hand, including abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nRepetitive radial and ulnar deviation of the wrist, associated with flexion of the thumb, causes thickening of the tendon sheath and pain when the inflamed tendons cross the distal radial styloid.\nPatients who report these symptoms often have occupations that involve repetitive gripping and grasping with the thumb or pastimes such as racquet sports, golf, or disk throwing.

        "Toe Amputation": "\nBackground\n\n\nToe amputation is a common procedure performed by a wide variety of healthcare providers. The vast majority of toe amputations are performed on patients with a diabetic foot.\n [1] Although regional variation is noted, most of these procedures are done by general, vascular, and orthopedic surgeons (particularly those subspecializing in foot and ankle surgery); in some countries, podiatrists are involved.\nThere are three broad indications for amputation of any body part, as follows (see Indications)\n [2] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Dead\n         \n\n\n\n          Deadly\n         \n\n\n\n          Dead loss\n         \n\n\n\nBefore any amputation, the clinician should ensure that the patient’s medical circumstances have been optimized (ie, should \"reverse the reversible\"). With impending toe amputation, this step encompasses such measures as glycemic control and consideration of revascularization when severe macrovascular disease is contributing to ischemia.\n\n\n\n\nThe method of toe amputation (disarticulation vs osteotomy) and the level of amputation (partial or whole phalanx vs whole digit vs ray) depend on numerous circumstances but are mainly determined by the extent of disease and the anatomy. With any amputation, the degree of postoperative functional loss is generally proportional to the amount of tissue taken. The great toe is considered the most important of the toes in functional terms. Nevertheless, great-toe amputation can be performed with little resulting functional deficit.\n [3, 4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)": "\nBackground\n\n\nTotal knee replacement (TKR) in some form has been practiced for more than 50 years, but in the earliest days of the procedure, the complexities of the knee joint were not fully understood. Because of this, TKR initially was not as successful as Sir John Charnley's artificial hip. However, dramatic advances in the knowledge of knee mechanics have led to design modifications that appear to be durable.\n\nSignificant advances have occurred in the type and quality of the metals, polyethylene, and ceramics used in the prosthesis manufacturing process, leading to improved longevity. As with most techniques in modern medicine, more and more patients are receiving the benefits of total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n [3, 4]  In 2020, according to the 2021 annual report from the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR), 124,307 primary TKAs were performed in the United States, along with 10,526 revision knee arthroplasties and 5857 partial knee arthroplasties.\n [5] \n\nIn the 1860s, Fergusson reported performing a resection arthroplasty of the knee for arthritis. Verneuil is thought to have performed the first interposition arthroplasty using joint capsule. Other tissues were subsequently tried, including skin, muscle, fascia, fat, and even pig bladder.\n\nThe first artificial implants were tried in the 1940s as molds fitted to the femoral condyles following similar designs in the hip. In the next decade, tibial replacement was also attempted, but both designs had problems with loosening and persistent pain.\n\nCombined femoral and tibial articular surface replacements appeared in the 1950s as simple hinges. These implants failed to account for the complexities of knee motion and consequently had high failure rates from aseptic loosening. They were also associated with unacceptably high rates of postoperative infection.\n\nIn 1971, Gunston importantly recognized that the knee does not rotate on a single axis like a hinge; rather, the femoral condyles roll and glide on the tibia with multiple instant centers of rotation. His polycentric knee replacement had early success with its improved kinematics over hinged implants but was ultimately unsuccessful because of inadequate fixation of the prosthesis to bone.\n\nThe highly conforming and constrained Geomedic knee arthroplasty introduced in 1973 at the Mayo Clinic ignored Gunston's work, and a kinematic conflict arose. Other designs followed, either following Gunston's principle in attempting to reproduce normal knee kinematics or allowing a conforming articulation to govern knee motion.\n\nThe total condylar prosthesis was designed by Insall at the Hospital for Special Surgery in 1973. This prosthesis concentrated on mechanics and did not try to reproduce normal knee motion. In 1993, Ranawat et al reported a rate of survivorship of 94% at 15 years of follow-up, which is the most impressive reported to date.\n [6] \n\nThe component was subsequently altered to artificially introduce normal kinematics so as to improve the component's range of motion (ROM). At the same time, a prosthesis with more natural kinematics was developed at the Hospital for Special Surgery, relying on the retained cruciate ligaments to provide knee motion.\n\nThe argument over whether knee ligaments should be preserved or sacrificed continues to this day. Long-term follow-up studies do not show any significant differences, though gait appears to be less abnormal if ligaments are preserved, especially when walking up and down stairs. One theoretical way of incorporating normal kinematics and maximal conformity is to use mobile tibial bearings. Midterm follow-up studies of these prostheses have shown encouraging results.\n\nCemented TKR procedures have been the criterion standard for TKA, but uncemented designs with bioactive surfaces (eg, hydroxyapatite) have shown promising midterm results (see the image below).\n [7, 8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal knee arthroplasty.

This syndrome is distinct from fibromyalgia syndrome, which involves multiple tender points, though the two pain syndromes may be concurrent.\nMyofascial trigger points are a major cause of pain and dysfunction.\n [1]  They produce pain focally and in a referred pattern and often occur in conjunction with chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders. Various modalities for the treatment of trigger points include spray and stretch, ultrasound, manipulative therapy, and trigger point injections.\n\n\nNot all trigger points require injection or needling. Many active trigger points will respond to physical therapy, especially in the early stages of trigger point formation.

        "Triple Arthrodesis": "\nBackground\n\n\nA triple arthrodesis is a procedure consisting of the surgical fusion of the talocalcaneal (TC), talonavicular (TN), and calcaneocuboid (CC) joints in the foot. The primary goals of a triple arthrodesis are to relieve pain from arthritic, deformed, or unstable joints. Other important goals are the correction of deformity and the creation of a stable, balanced plantigrade foot for ambulation.\nEdwin W Ryerson first described triple arthrodesis in 1923 as a fusion of the TC, TN, and CC joints.\n [1] The aim was to create a well-aligned, plantigrade, and stable foot that would allow patients with paralytic or deforming conditions to function better. The most common indications were to correct lower-extremity deformities in children resulting from poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, clubfoot, or tuberculosis.\n\n\nThe original procedures were performed by removing large blocks of subchondral bone and correcting the angular deformities by inserting or removing wedges. The corrections were maintained by casting that often required later manipulation for loss of position. Kirschner wires (K-wires), Steinmann pins, and staples were used over time to hold the corrections in place but are now not as common.\nInternal fixation with various compression screws using the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) technique and specially designed plating systems has become the standard of care.\n\n\n\n\nFor patient education resources, see the Foot, Ankle, Knee, and Hip Center and Arthritis Center, as well as Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Ulnar Nerve Release": "\nBackground\n\n\nUlnar nerve release is performed for cubital tunnel syndrome with positive clinical and instrumental signs (on nerve conduction studies and electromyography [EMG]) of compression at the elbow.\nIn 1957, Osborne described simple decompression of the ulnar nerve achieved by cutting the ligament subsequently named after him (the Osborne fascia or band). This ligament is part of the fibrous arcade, a fascia running between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU). Osborne divided this fibrous band connecting the medial epicondyle and the olecranon and reported results favorable to those of the anterior transposition procedures, which at that time represented the standard of surgical care for compressive ulnar neuropathies at the elbow.\n\n\nIn his report, Osborne observed that the ulnar neuritis was a result of direct compression of the nerve within the tunnel and that the flexion of the elbow exacerbated this condition.\nThe compression causes progressive disruption of the vascular supply to the nerve.\n [1] In a normal elbow, the nerve undergoes tensile forces that increase the nerve strain; when the elbow is flexed, the nerve is pushed against its bed, and upon extension, the nerve diverges away from the elbow.\n\n\n\n\nThe ulnar nerve at the elbow could be compressed at different sites, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Proximal to the cubital tunnel at the level of the medial epicondyle - The arcade of Struthers is a canal made up by the intermuscular septum, the internal brachial ligament, and the triceps; at this site, between the middle and distal thirds of the humerus, the ulnar nerve travels from the anterior to the posterior compartment of the arm\n         \n\n\n\n          Distal to the cubital tunnel - The compression might be caused by the arcuate ligament of Osborne that runs between the two heads of origin of the FCU and therefore between the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the medial aspect of the olecranon\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nUlnar nerve compression at the elbow is the second most common compression neuropathy in the upper limbs (after median nerve compression in the carpal tunnel), with an incidence of 25 per 100,000 population per year. The condition is more common in men than in women, possibly as a consequence of the smaller coronoid process of the ulna and the more abundant subcutaneous fat tissue in women.\n\nNontraumatic ulnar nerve compressive neuropathy is usually associated with arthritis, and there are no other known causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty": "\nBackground\n\n\nUnicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has had varying degrees of acceptance since its introduction in the 1950s.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  Frequent and early failures were cited in initial studies. Consequently, by the late 1980s, the popularity of UKA had waned. However, after recognizing the need to avoid overcorrection of the mechanical axis, surgeons ultimately were able to reduce the risk that pain in the \"normal\" compartment would cause early failure.\nWith the publication of several studies in the late 1980s and 1990s reporting 10-year survivorship rates exceeding 93%, enthusiasm for UKA again increased, survivorship being comparable to that for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Although in 1994, the Swedish Joint Replacement Registry reported a high percentage of poor results for UKA, these outcomes mainly reflected the fact that the surgery was performed on patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis.\n [7] \n\n\nInterest in UKA was also stimulated by the introduction of the mobile-bearing form of the procedure. Goodfellow and O'Connor, along with others, published excellent long-term survivorship rates associated with this technique.\n [8]  Their rationale for the procedure's success was clearly stated: a mobile bearing (also called a meniscal bearing) provides the unique combination of complete congruency of the articular surface (to minimize wear and creep) and total freedom of movement (to accommodate the preferred motion pattern of the retained natural compartment).  However, mobile-bearing procedures have higher failure rates due to bearing dislocations.\n [9] \nSubsequently, there was a heightened interest in UKA, particularly because of the introduction of the minimally invasive parapatellar technique. This form of the procedure potentially can reduce morbidity, complications, and length of hospital stay. Many view UKA as preferable to high tibial osteotomy (HTO) in relatively young patients with medial compartment arthritis.\n\n\n\n\nAdvances in the use of robotics have been reported to reduce technical problems related to bone resection and implant positioning and lower revision rates.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nTheoretical advantages of the procedure include preservation of uninvolved tissue and bone, reduced operating time, better range of motion (ROM), improved gait, and increased patient satisfaction. Failure and revision are more common during the early (< 5 years) postoperative period and arehave been associated with incorrect indications and/or technical errors during surgery.\n [11] With appropriate patient selection, careful surgical technique, and proper implant design, UKA can now be viewed as a procedure with reliable medium- to long-term success.\n [12, 13] \n\nBecause UKA is typically performed for medial osteoarthritis, this article focuses primarily on that condition.\n\nFor patient education information, see the Arthritis Health Center, as well as Knee Pain Health Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

It can occur after vaginal or cesarean delivery and is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in both developing and developed countries as well.\n [1, 2, 3] The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony; up to 80% of the cases result from suboptimal contraction of the myometrium following placental separation.\nAfter excluding other etiologies of PPH such as retained placenta, uterine rupture, genital tract trauma, uterine inversion, and coagulopathy, the management of uterine atony should be timely and initiated to prevent hemorrhagic, hypovolemic shock, dilutional coagulopathy, tissue hypoxia, and acidosis. The pituitary gland, the kidneys, and the lungs are particularly susceptible organs to damage when perfusion pressure decreases resulting in feared sequelae of postpartum hypovolemic shock such as Sheehan syndrome (ie, postpartum hypopituitarism), renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n\nThe repertoires of the management measures can be generally divided into operative and nonoperative interventions. In acute postpartum hemorrhage refractory to medical and other conservative interventions, invasive therapies may include arterial embolization, uterine compression sutures, uterine artery ligation, and, ultimately, hysterectomy. However, these measures are highly invasive, require extensive resources, expertise, and are associated with significant morbidities.\nIntrauterine balloon tamponade has been suggested as an effective, easily administered minimally invasive treatment option to control uterine bleeding while preserving the mother’s ability to bear additional children.\n [4, 5, 6] Multiple types of balloons are available, including Bakri balloon, BT-cath balloon tamponade catheter, Foley catheters, Rusch balloon, condom catheters and the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube.

A Bartholin cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops in one of the Bartholin glands or ducts when the duct that drains the fluid from the gland becomes blocked and causes the duct and gland to swell.\n [2] A Bartholin gland abscess develops either when a Bartholin cyst becomes infected or when the Bartholin gland itself becomes infected.\n [3] For more information on disorders of the Bartholin gland, please see Medscape Reference articles Bartholin Gland Diseases and Benign Vulvar Lesions.\nAlthough empiric antibiotic therapy is not indicated in the immunocompetent patient who presents with Bartholin gland abscess without cellulitis, it is helpful to know that a substantial proportion of patients with Bartholin gland abscess are culture positive, with Escherichia coli being the single most common pathogen.\n [4] \n\n\nDifferent techniques exist for the treatment of Bartholin cysts and abscesses, but there has been no proven superiority between surgical and conservative management strategies.\n [5] The most commonly used approaches are: (1) fistulization using a Word catheter and (2) marsupialization.\n [6] \nOther techniques include: (1) silver nitrate gland ablation; (2) cyst or abscess fenestration, ablation, or excision using carbon dioxide (CO2) laser; (3) needle aspiration with or without alcohol sclerotherapy; (4) gland excision; and (5) incision and drainage followed by primary suture closure.\n [7, 8, 9] \n\n\n\n\nNo recurrence after marsupialization has been reported in available studies. Recurrence rates after other treatments has varied; recurrence was most common after aspiration alone (approximately 38%).

        "Bartholin Gland Marsupialization": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nThe greater vestibular glands (commonly known as the Bartholin glands) make up an important part of the female reproductive system. The Bartholin glands have a primary function of secreting mucus to help provide vulvar and vaginal lubrication.\n [1]  To fulfill this purpose, each Bartholin gland contains a duct that measures approximately 5 mm in diameter in the average female. For proper secretion, the epithelium of each gland is columnar in nature, while the epithelium of each duct is simple. The orifice is of the stratified squamous type. The secretion produced is a thick, mucoid, clear substance with a basic pH, and it provides lubrication during sexual activity.\n [2] \n\n\nMeasuring from 1.5-2 cm on average, each Bartholin gland is oval in shape and resides just inferior and lateral to the bulbocavernosus muscle. Innervation is received from a small branch of the perineal nerve, while arterial blood supply is received from a small branch of the artery on the bulbocavernosus muscle. Likewise, venous drainage is also via vessels on the bulbocavernosus muscle. Lymphatics are via the vestibular plexus and pudendal vessels, and this drainage route is important to consider when in-depth surgery is needed.\n [2] See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\nBartholin gland nerve innervation \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a gland becomes infected or a duct becomes obstructed, the result is often the development of a Bartholin cyst or abscess that may require medical attention.\n [3, 4] This occurs in 2% of women.

Cesarean delivery will be the preferred mode of delivery for most physicians because of the diminishing expertise in vaginal breech delivery.\"\n\n\nIn the modern landscape of obstetrics, vaginal breech delivery has become a rarity.

        "Breech Extraction Delivery": "\nOverview\n\n\nFetal malpresentation occurs in about 4% of all term pregnancies. The most common malpresentation by far is breech presentation, where the fetal longitudinal lie is oriented parallel to the long axis of the uterus and the buttocks are near the cervix. There are 3 types of breech presentation: frank (hips are flexed and the legs are extended), complete (hips and legs are flexed), and footling or incomplete (incomplete flexion of one or both hips).\nA transverse lie occurs when the fetal longitudinal axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the uterus. The location of the spine determines if the fetus is \"back up\" (the curvature of the spine is in the upper part of the uterus) or \"back down\" (the curvature of the spine is in the lower part of the uterus).\n\n\nAbnormal fetal presentations are more common in twin gestations. Approximately 30% of all twins are in a vertex/breech presentation and 10% are vertex/transverse lie at the time of delivery.\nSingleton fetuses with abnormal presentation are generally delivered at term. The safest route of delivery in such a clinical setting remains somewhat controversial. Some studies have shown that a planned cesarean delivery decreases the risk of perinatal or neonatal mortality compared to planned vaginal birth for the term singleton fetus in breech presentation.\n [1] The ideal time for the delivery of an uncomplicated twin gestation is also unclear. Some studies suggest that the lowest incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes is somewhere between 36-37 weeks, with a rise in perinatal mortality by 38 weeks' gestation.\n [2, 3, 4] \n\n\n\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recognizes that uncomplicated twin gestations at 38 weeks with appropriate fetal growth and reassuring fetal surveillance can be continued. However, in the event of pregnancy-associated conditions that might improve with delivery, obstetricians can consider elective delivery with documented fetal pulmonary maturity. This should be determined for each twin when technically feasible. ACOG also recommends that the mode of delivery be based on the presentation of the fetuses, the ease of fetal heart rate monitoring, and the maternal and fetal status.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nWhile the safety of a vaginal delivery for vertex/vertex twins is well documented, the ideal management when the second twin is nonvertex is still controversial.\n [6, 7] Despite differences in opinions on the most appropriate route of delivery for vertex/nonvertex twins, some experts agree that, in well-selected cases, vaginal breech delivery may be appropriate for the nonvertex second twin.\n\nIn the hands of an experienced obstetrician, external cephalic version and total breech extraction are 2 reasonable options for the delivery of the noncephalic second twin.\n [2, 6, 8, 9] Although both options are reasonable, total breech extraction is recommended because it is associated with a higher success rate of a vaginal delivery when compared to the external version of a second twin. A review by Aviram et al also concluded that breech extraction performed by an experienced obstetrician offered a greater likelihood of successful vaginal delivery of the second twin than did external cephalic version.\n [10] \n\nA breech extraction refers to the procedure in which the infant's feet are grasped by the operator and the fetus is extracted from the uterine cavity through the vagina. It is performed for the delivery of the second twin in a vertex/nonvertex presentation. Successful completion of this delivery depends upon a well-trained and experienced obstetrician.\n [2, 7, 11] This article reviews the steps for a complete breech extraction and the possible complications that might be encountered during the procedure.\n\nA study by Jonsdottir et al indicated that in twin births, internal podalic version and breech extraction of the second, nonvertex twin after vaginal delivery of the first twin may have a slightly better outcome than will cesarean delivery of the second twin. The study, which involved 457 twin births, included 418 cases in which the second twin was delivered by cesarean section and 39 cases in which the twin was delivered by internal podalic version and breech extraction. The investigators found a lower rate of asphyxia in the breech extractions than in the cesarean births. In addition, Apgar scores and umbilical cord pH levels tended to be higher in the infants who underwent breech extraction than in the cesarean section group, although the differences were not significant.\n [12] \n\nIn the absence of an operator experienced in vaginal breech delivery, cesarean delivery is prudent.\n\nProper patient counseling should be provided and documented in the medical record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Cervical Cerclage": "\nTechnique\n\n\nApproach\nCerclage is usually done transvaginally as either a McDonald\n [1] or a Shiradkor\n [2] procedure. When these 2 procedures are unsuccessful or difficult to perform, the transabdominal cerclage procedure is done.\n [3] \n\n\nMcDonald’s Cerclage\nThe McDonald’s cerclage is performed using a permanent suture. It was originally described as follows: \"The bladder having been emptied, the cervix is exposed and grasped by Allis' or Babcock forceps. A purse string suture of No. 4 Mersilk on a Mayo needle is inserted around the exo-cervix as high as possible to approximate to the level of the internal os. This is at the junction of the rugose vagina and smooth cervix. Five or six bites with the needle are made, with special attention to the stitches behind the cervix. These are difficult to insert and must be deep...The stitch is pulled tight enough to close the internal os, the knot being made in front of the cervix and the end left long enough to facilitate subsequent division.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe author usually uses a Prolene #1 suture placed in a purse string fashion. Under regional anesthesia, the cervix is visualized by placing a long weighted speculum posteriorly, and curved or right angle retractors anteriorly and laterally as needed. With patient in stirrups and in the lithotomy position, the author uses an Allis to grasp the cervix as high in the vagina as possible, first at the 10 o'clock position. This Allis is used to retract cervical tissue inferiorly and laterally, to ensure that only cervical tissue is included in the bite and that the cervical canal is not violated or entered. The suture is placed immediately below the Allis clamp, hugging the clamp as the curved needle is rotated through. This maneuver is then repeated at the 8, 4, and 2 o'clock positions.\n\n\n\n\nA surgeon's knot is placed, the knot is cinched down tightly, and several additional throws are placed (see the image below). The ends are cut long to allow identification at term and facilitate removal. Several different modifications have been described, including placement of a second suture above the first if the surgeon feels the cervical length (which should be more than 10 mm) below the first suture is inadequate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuture placement. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nShiradkor Technique\nThe original technique was described as follows:\n\nI. A strip of fascia lata 1/4 inch wide and 4 1/2 inches long, is removed from the outer side of the thigh, and each end of this strip is transfixed with a linen suture.\n\n2. The cervix is pulled down, a transverse incision is made above the cervix as in anterior colporrhaphy, and the bladder is pushed well up above the internal os.\n\n3. The cervix is then pulled forward, toward the symphysis pubis, and a vertical incision is made in the posterior vaginal wall, again at and above the internal os, going only through the vaginal wall.\n\n4. Through the right and left corner of the anterior incision an aneurysm needle is passed between the cervix and the vaginal wall until its eye comes out of the posterior incision.\n\n5. The linen attached to each end of the fascia is passed through the eye of the aneurysm needle, and the right end of the fascia is pulled retrovaginally forward into the anterior incision. The same thing is done from the left side.\n\n6. The two ends of the strip cross each other in front of the cervix and are tightened to close the internal os. The operator's left index finger in the internal os will indicate how much to pull on the strips. The assistant should be holding one end of the strip with an artery forceps.\n\n7. The two ends are stitched together by a number of stitches that take a bite of the muscle fibers of the lowest part of the lower uterine segment, using a small curved needle and fine linen.\n\n8. Extra portions of the fascia are cut out, and the anterior and posterior incisions are closed with chromic catgut No. 0.\n\nMany modifications have been made, but in general the Shiradkor technique involves dissection of the vaginal mucosa and retraction of the bladder and rectum to expose the cervix at the level of the internal os. Usually, a curved Allis clamp is used to grasp the lateral edges of the anterior and posterior aspects of the transverse incisions and some paracervical tissue. The suture is then placed using a 5 mm tape suture with a double blunt needle at each end. The suture is placed anteriorly and tied posteriorly or placed posteriorly and tied anteriorly. If the patient is to be delivered by cesarean, the suture can be buried under the vaginal mucosa, which is then re-approximated using absorbable suture, or the knot can be left exposed for easy removal if vaginal delivery is planned.\n\nCaspi et al described a modification using a single transverse incision in the anterior fornix.\n [4] A monofilament suture is passed on each side, under the mucosa at the level of the internal os, from the anterior incision to exit through the mucosa of the posterior cervix, and is then tied. The procedure was compared with the modified technique of Shirodkar in a randomized fashion in 90 subjects with previous failed McDonald procedure or with cervical anatomy felt to be unfavorable for McDonald cerclage placement.\n [5] Similar pregnancy outcomes were reported. The investigators believed that this modification has the advantages of simplicity, ease of removal, and lower incidence of severe vaginal discharge.\n\nA retrospective study by Kindinger et al that included 678 women who received cervical cerclage reported that compared to monofilament suture, braided cerclage was associated with increased intrauterine death (15% vs 5%; P = 0.0001) and preterm birth (28% vs 17%; P = 0.0006). A prospective, longitudinal, follow-up study of the vaginal microbiome in women at risk of preterm birth because of short cervical length (≤25 mm) also found that braided suture induced a persistent shift toward vaginal microbiome dysbiosis. Although these results are preliminary and we need additional studies to confirm these findings, it appears that monofilament synthetic non-absorbable sutures like Prolene may be advantageous to braided sutures in the setting of cervical cerclage in pregnant women.\n [6] \n\nAuthors' preference\nThe patient is placed in the lithotomy position in stirrups. The vagina is prepped with Betadine. A long, weighted speculum is placed in the posterior vagina. The posterior lip of the cervix is grasped with ring forceps or tenacula. Care should be exercised not to lacerate the cervix.\n\nSince bleeding from the anterior mucosal incision often obscures the operator's view of the posterior cervix, the posterior mucosal incision is made first. A small (2-cm) vertical incision is begun approximately 2.5 cm above the external os and carried proximally. The plane between the vaginal mucosa and the cervix is entered and developed using blunt dissection.\n\nThe cervicovesical reflection is identified. The anterior mucosal incision, approximately 2 cm long is made transversely at the cervicovesical reflection, and blunt dissection is used to develop the appropriate plane approaching as close to the internal os as possible.\n\nA curved Allis clamp is used to bring the mucosa and paracervical tissue laterally. One blade of the clamp is inserted in the anterior incision and the other in the posterior incision. As the clamp is closed, the tissue is drawn away from the substance of the cervix.\n\nFive mm Mersilene tape on a curved needle is used. It is placed similarly to what is described above for the McDonald's procedure. The needle is rotated against the clamp hugging the tip of the clamp opposite the curvature of the cervix. This ensures avoiding the cervical canal and membranes. It is best to enter posteriorly first so the knot ends up posterior and not anteriorly against the bladder. The exact procedure is performed on the opposite side driving the needle in the anterior to posterior direction.\n\nA small permanent suture such as 3-0 Prolene can then be used to anchor the suture anteriorly at the level of internal os, or an absorbable suture can be used. Placing the permanent suture to anchor the tape anteriorly through the vaginal mucosa allows easy removal if the cerclage is to be removed later.\n\nThe cerclage can then be tied posteriorly. The ends are left long and through the posterior incision. The edges of the posterior and anterior incision are approximated by interrupted 3-0 chromic.\n\nThe advantage of Shiradkor is placement close to the level of the internal os and that most of the suture is buried (see image below); the disadvantages include bleeding when it is performed during pregnancy and difficulty in removal at term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCervical cerclage. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAbdominal Cerclage\nSome patients manifest severe cervical injures, and others have apparent congenital absence of the cervix, rendering Shirodkar or McDonald cerclage technically difficult or impossible. Benson and Durfee described an abdominal approach to cerclage, a procedure that was applied to congenitally short or surgically amputated cervices.\n [7] \n\nNovy popularized this procedure and added the indications of \"wide or extensive cervical conization, cervico-vaginal fistulas following abortion, or a previously failed vaginal approach to cervical cerclage.\"\n [8] In addition, Novy suggested using this procedure in pregnant patients with cervical effacement that precluded high placement of a vaginal cerclage. Novy later reported on 16 patients treated with transabdominal cerclage during a 14 year interval, including 22 pregnancies, 21 of which resulted in living children.\n [9] \n\nGuidelines for patient selection include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious failed vaginal cerclage with scarring or lacerations rendering vaginal cerclage technically very difficult or impossible\n\n\n\n\nAbsent or very hypoplastic cervix with history of pregnancy loss fitting classical description of cervical insufficiency\n\n\n\nAdvantages to abdominal cerclage include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be performed in patients who cannot be treated successfully with vaginal cerclage.\n\n\n\n\nThe cerclage can be placed higher on the cervix, at the level of the internal os.\n\n\n\nThe main disadvantages of abdominal cerclage are:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patient must undergo two laparotomies, one for the cerclage placement and another for the cesarean delivery.\n\n\n\n\nThe pregnancy that results in fetal death or preterm labor prior to viability after abdominal cerclage will need a hysterotomy even though no living child will result.\n\n\n\nThis the procedure is reserved for highly selected cases. The following approach to abdominal cerclage is based upon Novy's descriptions:\n [8, 9, 10] \n\n\n\nThe procedure is planned at the end of the first trimester or the early second trimester, after fetal viability has been documented and initial ultrasound evaluation of the pregnancy has ruled out any major congenital malformation. It is important to wait until the risk of spontaneous first trimester abortion has passed, so that a second laparotomy to remove a nonviable pregnancy is not necessary.\n\nEither regional or general anesthesia can be employed. A catheter is placed in the bladder. Both Pfannenstiel and vertical abdominal incisions have been advocated, but transverse incision is adequate in most cases.\n\nThe peritoneal cavity is opened, and the bladder flap is incised transversely for approximately 5 cm at its reflection on the uterus, just above the level of internal cervical os. The bladder flap is advanced downward bluntly for about 5 cm\n\nThe uterus is wrapped in a laparotomy pad moistened with warm saline. The uterus is elevated through the abdominal incision, putting the cervix on traction. The uterine artery on each side is identified and retracted laterally. The avascular space between the ascending and descending branch is visualized and then this space is further expanded by gentle lateral retraction.\n\nA 5-mm Mersilene tape on a needle is then placed through the avascular space from anterior to posterior.\n\nThe same process is repeated on the other side of the uterus except that the needle carrying the Mersilene tape is now passed from posterior to anterior so that the knot can be placed anteriorly.\n\nCare must be taken to insure that the Mersilene tape is flat all the way around and not twisted. A square knot is placed anterior to the internal os, compressing the cervical tissue but not too tightly. The free ends of the tape are secured with 3-0 Prolene sutures placed approximately 1 to 2 cm distal to the knot. The remaining free ends are then cut away . The posterior portion of the band passes around the isthmus of the uterus at about the level of insertion of the uterosacral ligaments and is easily palpable and visible from behind as the uterus is drawn into the incision. Later it will become encased in scar tissue.\n\nThe peritoneal cavity, and abdominal incision are closed.\n\n\nEmergency Cerclage\nAll 3 of the above procedures for cervical insufficiency are best performed prior to cervical dilation and effacement. However, many patients do not have the classic history that indicates prophylactic cerclage in the late first or early second trimester. Such patients are managed expectantly, with cerclage reserved for those who manifest cervical change demonstrated clinically or by ultrasound.\n\nTherefore, many cerclage procedures are performed emergently rather than prophylactically. The most important step in performing emergency cerclage is making the diagnosis. Other causes of premature cervical dilation must be ruled out, specifically preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes and chorioamnionitis.\n\nIf regular uterine contractions are present, tocolysis may be considered. Abruptio placentae should be part of the differential diagnosis, especially with bleeding and is considered a relative contraindication to tocolysis and probably an absolute contraindication to cerclage.\n\nIn patient with contractions, emergency cerclage should only be considered if uterine contractions can be successfully inhibited and the clinician is convinced that preterm labor was the result of cervical dilation rather than the cause of it. In my experience, the McDonald procedure has worked well. Prolene no. 0 or 1 suture is used, and multiple small bites are taken. One or two circumferential sutures are placed and tied anteriorly.\n\nWhile ruptured membranes are clear contraindication to a cerclage, a number of investigators have published descriptions of approaches to the dilated cervix with bulging, unruptured membranes. McDonald suggested using a moistened swab on a sponge forceps to reduce the bulging membranes.\n [1] Goodlin suggested transabdominal amniocentesis to reduce the tension in the amniotic cavity and allow retraction of \"hourglassing\" membranes. (see image below)\n [11] The author has used this approach on occasion, but it usually does not reduce the prolapsed portion of the membranes, and other techniques are needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCervical cerclage. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nOlatunbosun and Dyck recommended the placement of patients in steep Trendelenburg position under general anesthesia and the use of 6 to 10 cervical stay sutures of no. 00 silk, then using traction on these sutures to cause the membranes to fall back into the uterine cavity before placing the cerclage.\n [12] \n\nKatz and Chez suggested that filling the bladder by instilling 400 to 500 cc of normal saline may lead to a retraction of the amniotic sac into the uterine cavity, thus facilitating cerclage placement.\n [13] \n\nI have used a foley catheter with a large balloon at the tip. With a full bladder, and the patient in steep Trendelenburg, the catheter is introduced in the cervix and the balloon gently inflated. The membrane usually retracts back inside the uterine cavity and the cerclage can be completed. The balloon is then deflated and the Foley is removed.\n\nCharles and Edwards recommended the use of prophylactic antibiotics when emergency cerclage is performed.\n [14] They found a 2.6-fold increase in chorioamnionitis when cerclage was performed after, compared to before, 18 weeks' gestation and a tripling in the likelihood of preterm PROM. The use of antibiotics should be individualized to specific cases. Please see the ACOG 2011 recommendations above. The use of tocolysis after an emergency cerclage also needs to be individualized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Cesarean Delivery": "\nOverview\n\n\nPractice Essentials\nCesarean delivery is defined as the delivery of a fetus through surgical incisions made through the abdominal wall (laparotomy) and the uterine wall (hysterotomy).\n\n\nIn 2014, 32.2% of women who gave birth in the United States did so by cesarean delivery.\n [1] The rapid increase in cesarean birth rates from 1996 to 2014 without clear evidence of concomitant decreases in maternal or neonatal morbidity or mortality raises significant concern that cesarean delivery is overused. The most common indications for primary cesarean delivery include labor dystocia, abnormal or indeterminate fetal heart rate tracing, fetal malpresentation, multiple gestation, and suspected fetal macrosomia. Safe reduction of the primary cesarean delivery rate will require different approaches for these indications, as well as others. Increasing women's access to nonmedical interventions during labor has also been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates. External cephalic version for breech presentation and a trial of labor for women with twin gestations when the first twin is in cephalic presentation are examples of interventions that can help to safely lower the primary cesarean delivery rate.\n [2] A practice bulletin from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all eligible women with breech presentations who are near term should be offered external cephalic version (ECV) to decrease the overall rate of cesarean delivery.\n [3, 4] \nACOG/SMFM guidelines for prevention of primary cesarean delivery\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) released joint guidelines for the safe prevention of primary cesarean delivery. These include the following\n [5, 6] :\n\n\n\n\n\nProlonged latent (early)-phase labor should be permitted\n\n\n\n\nThe start of active-phase labor can be defined as cervical dilation of 6 cm, rather than 4 cm\n\n\n\n\nIn the active phase, more time should be permitted for labor to progress\n\n\n\n\nMultiparous women should be allowed to push for 2 or more hours and primiparous women for 3 or more hours; pushing may be allowed to continue for even longer periods in some cases, as when epidural anesthesia is administered\n\n\n\n\nTechniques to aid vaginal delivery, such as the use of forceps, should be employed\n\n\n\n\nPatients should be encouraged to avoid excessive weight gain during pregnancy\n\n\n\n\nAccess to nonmedical interventions during labor, such as continuous support during labor and delivery, should be increased\n\n\n\n\nExternal cephalic version should be performed for breech presentation\n\n\n\n\nWomen with twin gestations should, if the first twin is in cephalic presentation, be permitted a trial of labor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nCesarean deliveries were initially performed to separate the mother and the fetus in an attempt to save the fetus of a moribund patient. They subsequently developed to resolve maternal or fetal complications not amenable to vaginal delivery, either for mechanical limitations or to temporize delivery for maternal or fetal benefit.\n\nThe leading indications for cesarean delivery (85%) are previous cesarean delivery, breech presentation, dystocia, and fetal distress.\n [7] \n\nMaternal indications for cesarean delivery include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat cesarean delivery\n\n\n\n\nObstructive lesions in the lower genital tract, including malignancies, large vulvovaginal condylomas, obstructive vaginal septa, and leiomyomas of the lower uterine segment that interfere with engagement of the fetal head\n\n\n\n\n          Pelvic abnormalities that preclude engagement or interfere with descent of the fetal presentation in labor  ​\n         \n\n\n\n          Certain cardiac conditions that preclude normal valsalva done by patients during a vaginal delivery\n          \n [8] \n\n\n\nFetal indications for cesarean delivery include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSituations in which neonatal morbidity and mortality could be decreased by the prevention of trauma\n\n\n\n\nMalpresentations (eg, preterm breech presentations, non-frank breech term fetuses)\n\n\n\n\nCertain congenital malformations or skeletal disorders\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n\n\n\n\nProlonged acidemia\n\n\n\nIndications for cesarean delivery that benefit the mother and the fetus include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAbnormal placentation (eg, placenta previa, placenta accreta)\n\n\n\n\nAbnormal labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion\n\n\n\n\nSituations in which labor is contraindicated\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThere are few contraindications to performing a cesarean delivery. In some circumstances, a cesarean delivery should be avoided, such as the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen maternal status may be compromised (eg, mother has severe pulmonary disease)\n\n\n\n\nIf the fetus has a known karyotypic abnormality or known congenital anomaly that may lead to death (anencephaly)\n\n\n\nCesarean delivery on maternal request\nControversy exists regarding elective cesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR). The 2013 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee on Obstetric Practice\n [9] and 2006 National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus committee\n [10] determined that the evidence supporting this concept was not conclusive and that more research is needed.\n\nBoth committees provided the following recommendations regarding CDMR\n [9, 10] :\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless there are maternal or fetal indications for cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery should be recommended\n\n\n\n\nCDMR should not be performed before 39 weeks’ gestation without verifying fetal lung maturity (due to a potential risk of respiratory problems for the baby)\n\n\n\n\nCDMR is not recommended for women who want more children (due to the increased risk for placenta previa/accreta and gravid hysterectomy with each cesarean delivery)\n\n\n\n\nThe inavailability of effective analgesia should not be a determinant for CDMR\n\n\n\nThe NIH consensus panel on CDMR also noted the following\n [10] :\n\n\n\n\n\nCDMR has a potential benefit of decreased risk of hemorrhage for the mother and decreased risk of birth injuries for the baby\n\n\n\n\nCDMR requires individualized counseling by the practitioner of the potential risks and benefits of both vaginal and cesarean delivery\n\n\n\nPreoperative management\nGuidelines recommend a minimum preoperative fasting time of at least 2 hours from clear liquids, 6 hours from a light meal, and 8 hours from a regular meal.\n [11] However, patients are usually asked not to eat anything for 12 hours prior to the procedure.\n [12] \n\nThe following are also included in preoperative management:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacement of an intravenous (IV) line\n\n\n\n\nInfusion of IV fluids (eg, lactated Ringer solution or saline with 5% dextrose)\n\n\n\n\nPlacement of a Foley catheter (to drain the bladder and to monitor urine output)\n\n\n\n\nPlacement of an external fetal monitor and monitors for the patient’s blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation\n\n\n\n\nPreoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (decreases risk of endometritis after elective cesarean delivery by 76%, regardless of the type of cesarean delivery [emergent or elective])\n [13] \n\n\n\n\nEvaluation by the surgeon and the anesthesiologist\n\n\n\nLaboratory testing\n\nThe following laboratory studies may be obtained prior to cesarean delivery:\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete blood count\n\n\n\n\nBlood type and screen, cross-match\n\n\n\n\nScreening tests for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, syphilis\n\n\n\n\nCoagulation studies (eg, prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times, fibrinogen level)\n\n\n\nImaging studies\n\nIn labor and delivery, document fetal position and estimated fetal weight. Although ultrasonography is commonly used to estimate fetal weight, a prospective study reported the sensitivity of clinical and ultrasonographic prediction of macrosomia, respectively, as 68% and 58%.\n [14] \n\nCesarean delivery\nThe technique for cesarean delivery includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nLaparotomy via midline infraumbilical, vertical, or transverse (eg, Pfannenstiel, Mayland, Joel Cohen) incision\n\n\n\n\nHysterotomy via a transverse (Monroe-Kerr) or vertical (eg, Kronig, DeLee) incision\n\n\n\n\nFetal delivery\n\n\n\n\nUterine repair\n\n\n\n\n          Closure\n         \n\n\n\nIf patient has been counseled and consented prior to the procedure, an IUD can be placed prior to the repair of the hysterotomy or a Levonorgestrel subdermal implant can be placed in the patient's arm at this time\n [15] \n\n\n\nPostoperative management\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nRoutine postoperative assessment\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of vital signs, urine output, and amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n\n\n\nPalpation of the fundus\n\n\n\n\nIV fluids; advance to oral diet as appropriate, early feeding has been shown to shorten hospital stay\n [16] \n\n\n\n\nIV or intramuscular (IM) analgesia if patient did not receive a long-acting analgesic or had general anesthesia; analgesia is usually not needed if patient received regional anesthesia, with/without a long-acting analgesic\n\n\n\n\nAmbulation on postoperative day 1; advance as tolerated\n\n\n\n\nIf patient plans to breastfeed, initiate within a few hours after delivery; if patient plans to bottle feed, she may use a tight bra or breast binder in the postoperative period\n\n\n\n\nDischarge on postoperative day 2 to 4, if no complications\n [17] \n\n\n\n\nDiscuss contraception as well as refraining from intercourse for 4-6 weeks postpartum, unless the patient had LARC placed at the time of the procedure\n [15] \n\n\n\nComplications\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 2-fold increase in maternal mortality and morbidity with cesarean delivery relative to a vaginal delivery\n [18] : Partly related to the procedure itself, and partly related to conditions that may have led to needing to perform a cesarean delivery\n\n\n\n\nInfection (eg, postpartum endomyometritis, fascial dehiscence, wound, urinary tract)\n\n\n\n\nThromboembolic disease (eg, deep venous thrombosis, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis)\n\n\n\n\nAnesthetic complications\n\n\n\n\nSurgical injury (eg, uterine lacerations; bladder, bowel, ureteral injuries)\n\n\n\n\nUterine atony\n\n\n\n\nDelayed return of bowel function\n\n\n\nThe graph below depicts cesarean delivery rates in the US (1991-2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCesarean delivery rates, United States. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nBackground\nCesarean delivery is defined as the delivery of a fetus through surgical incisions made through the abdominal wall (laparotomy) and the uterine wall (hysterotomy). Because the words \"cesarean\" and \"section\" are both derived from verbs that mean to cut, the phrase \"cesarean section\" is a tautology. Consequently, the terms \"cesarean delivery\" and \"cesarean birth\" are preferable.\n\nCesarean deliveries were initially performed to separate the mother and the fetus in an attempt to save the fetus of a moribund patient. This operation subsequently developed into a surgical procedure to resolve maternal or fetal complications not amenable to vaginal delivery, either for mechanical limitations or to temporize delivery for maternal or fetal benefit.\n\nThe cesarean delivery has evolved from a vain attempt performed to save the fetus to one in which physician and patient both participate in the decision-making process, striving to achieve the most benefit for the patient and her unborn child.\n\nCurrently, cesarean deliveries are performed for a variety of fetal and maternal indications (see Indications). The indications have expanded to consider the patient’s wishes and preferences. Controversy surrounds the current rates of cesarean delivery in developed countries and its use for indications other than medical necessity.Go to Perimortem Cesarean Delivery and Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Delivery for complete information on these topics.\n\nFrequency\nFrom 1910-1928, the cesarean delivery rate at Chicago Lying-in Hospital increased from 0.6% to 3%. The cesarean delivery rate in the United States was 4.5% in 1965. According to the National Hospital Discharge Survey, the cesarean rate rose from 5.5% in 1970 to 24.1% in 1986. Fewer than 10% of mothers had a vaginal birth after a prior cesarean, and women spent an average of 5 days in the hospital for a cesarean delivery and only 2.6 days for a vaginal delivery.\n\nIt was predicted that if age-specific cesarean rates continued at the steady pattern of increase observed since 1970, 40% of births would be by cesarean in the year 2000.\n [19] Those predictions fell short, but not by much. The National Center for Health Statistics reported that the percentage of cesarean births in the United States increased from 20.7% in 1996 to 32.2% in 2014.\n [1, 20] Cesarean rates increased for women of all ages, races/ethnic groups, and gestational ages and in all states (see the image below). Both primary and repeat cesareans increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCesarean delivery rates, United States. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIncreases in the primary cesareans with no specified indication were faster than in the overall population and appear to be the result of changes in obstetric practice rather than changes in the medical risk profile or increases in maternal request.\n [21] \n\nThis has occurred despite several studies that note an increased risk for neonatal and maternal mortality for all cesarean deliveries as well as for medically elective cesareans compared with vaginal births.\n [22] The decrease in total and repeat cesarean delivery rates noted between 1990 and 2000 was due to a transient increase in the rate of vaginal births after cesarean delivery.\n [23] \n\nThe cesarean delivery rate has also increased throughout the world, but rates in certain parts of the world are still substantially lower than in the United States. The cesarean delivery rate is approximately 21.1% for the most developed regions of the globe, 14.3% for the less developed regions, and 2% for the least developed regions.\n [24] \n\nIn a 2006 publication reviewing cesarean delivery rates in South America, the median rate was 33% with rates fluctuating between 28% and 75% depending on public service versus a private provider. The authors conclude that higher rates of cesarean delivery do not necessarily indicate better perinatal care and can be associated with harm.\n [25] \n\nWhy the rate of cesarean delivery has increased so dramatically in the United States is not entirely clear. Some reasons that may account for the increase are repeat cesarean delivery, delay in childbirth and reduced parity, decrease in the rate of vaginal breech delivery, decreased perinatal mortality with cesarean delivery, nonreassuring fetal heart rate testing, and fear of malpractice litigation, as described in the following paragraphs.\n\nIn 1988, when the cesarean delivery rate peaked at 24.7%, 36.3% (351,000) of all cesarean deliveries were repeat procedures. Although reports concerning the safety of allowing vaginal birth after a cesarean delivery had been present since the 1960s,\n [26] by 1987, fewer than 10% of women with a prior cesarean delivery were attempting a vaginal delivery.\n\nIn 2003, the repeat cesarean delivery rate for all women was 89.4%; the rate for low-risk women was 88.7%. Today, low-risk women giving birth for the first time who have a cesarean delivery are more likely to have a subsequent cesarean delivery.\n [27] \n\nIn the past decade, an increase in the percentage of births to women aged 30-50 years has occurred despite a decrease in their relative size within the population.\n [28] The cesarean rate for mothers aged 40-54 years in 2007 was more than twice the cesarean rate for mothers younger than 20 years (48% and 23%, respectively).\n [28] The risk of having a cesarean delivery is higher in nulliparous patients, and, with increasing maternal age, the risk for cesarean delivery is increased secondary to medical complications such as diabetes and preeclampsia.\n\nBy 1985, almost 85% of all breech presentations (3% of term fetuses) were delivered by cesarean. In 2001, a multicenter and multinational prospective study determined that the safest mode of delivery for a breech presentation was cesarean delivery.\n [29] This study has been criticized for differences in the standards of care among the study centers that does not allow a standard recommendation.\n [30] \n\nThe most recent recommendation from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) regarding breech delivery is that planned vaginal delivery may be reasonable under hospital-specific protocol guidelines for both eligibility and labor management.\n [31] This may lead to a small decrease in breech delivery rates, but the overwhelming majority of cases will probably continue to be delivered by elective cesarean.\n\nA cluster-randomized controlled trial by Chaillet et al reported a significant but small reduction in the rate of cesarean delivery. The benefit was driven by the effect of the intervention in low-risk pregnancies.\n [32, 33] \n\nIndications\nMany indications exist for performing a cesarean delivery. In those women who are having a scheduled procedure (ie, an elective or indicated repeat, for malpresentation or placental abnormalities), the decision has already been made that the alternate of medical therapy, ie, a vaginal delivery, is least optimal.\n\nFor other patients admitted to labor and delivery, the anticipation is for a vaginal delivery. Every patient admitted in this circumstance is admitted with the thought of a successful vaginal delivery. However, if the patient’s situation should change, a cesarean delivery is performed because it is believed that outcome may be better for the fetus, the mother, or both.\n\nA cesarean delivery is performed for maternal indications, fetal indications, or both. The leading indications for cesarean delivery are previous cesarean delivery, breech presentation, dystocia, and fetal distress. These indications are responsible for 85% of all cesarean deliveries.\n [7] \n\nMaternal indications\nMaternal indications for cesarean delivery include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat cesarean delivery\n\n\n\n\nObstructive lesions in the lower genital tract, including malignancies, large vulvovaginal condylomas, obstructive vaginal septa, and leiomyomas of the lower uterine segment that interfere with engagement of the fetal head\n\n\n\n\nPelvic abnormalities that preclude engagement or interfere with descent of the fetal presentation in labor\n\n\n\nRelative maternal indications include conditions in which the increasing intrathoracic pressure generated by Valsalva maneuvers could lead to maternal complications. These include left heart valvular stenosis, dilated aortic valve root, certain cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs),\n [8] and recent retinal detachment. Women who have previously undergone vaginal or perineal reparative surgery (eg, colporrhaphy or repair of major anal involvement from inflammatory bowel disease) also benefit from cesarean delivery to avoid damage to the previous surgical repair.\n\nNo clear evidence supports planned cesarean delivery for extreme maternal obesity. A prospective cohort study from the United Kingdom included women with a body mass index of 50 kg/m2 or more and noted possible increased shoulder dystocia (3% vs 0%) but found no significant differences in anesthetic, postnatal, or neonatal complications between women who underwent planned vaginal delivery and those who underwent planned caesarean delivery.\n [34]  However recent studies indicate that obese and extremly obese women have an increased odds ration of having a cesarean section, 2.05 and 2.89 compared with normal weight women.\n [35] \n\nDystocia in labor (labor dystocia) is a very commonly cited indication for cesarean delivery, but it is not specific. Dystocia is classified as a protraction disorder or as an arrest disorder. These can be primary or secondary disorders. Most dystocias are caused by abnormalities of the power (uterine contractions), the passage (maternal pelvis), or the passenger (the fetus).\n [36] \n\nWhen a diagnosis of dystocia in labor is made, the indication should be detailed according to the previous classification (ie, primary or secondary disorder, arrest or protraction disorder, or a combination of the above). For further information, see Abnormal Labor.\n\nRecently, debate has arisen over the option of elective cesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR). Evidence shows that it is reasonable to inform the pregnant woman requesting a cesarean delivery of the associated risks and benefits for the current and any subsequent pregnancies. The clinician’s role should be to provide the best possible evidence-based counseling to the woman and to respect her autonomy and decision-making capabilities when considering route of delivery.\n [37] \n\nIn 2006, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a consensus conference to address CDMR. They resolved that the evidence supporting this concept was not conclusive.\n [10] Their recommendations included the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nCDMR should be avoided by women wanting several children.\n\n\n\n\nCDMR should not be performed before the 39th week of pregnancy or without verifying fetal lung maturity.\n\n\n\n\nCDMR has a potential benefit of decreased risk of hemorrhage for the mother and decreased risk of birth injuries for the baby.\n\n\n\n\nCDMR has a potential risk of respiratory problems for the baby.\n\n\n\n\nCDMR is associated with a longer maternal hospital stay and increasing risk of placenta previa and placenta accreta with each successive cesarean.\n [38] \n\n\n\nThe NIH further noted that the procedure requires individualized counseling by the practitioner of the potential risks and benefits of both vaginal and cesarean delivery, and it should not be motivated by the unavailability of effective pain management.\n [10] \n\nDetractors of CDMR argue that the premise of cesarean on request applies to a very small portion of the population and that it should not be routinely offered on ethical grounds.\n [39] The emerging consensus is that a randomized prospective study is required to address this issue.\n [40] \n\nFetal indications\nFetal indications for cesarean delivery include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSituations in which neonatal morbidity and mortality could be decreased by the prevention of trauma\n\n\n\n\nMalpresentations\n\n\n\n\nCertain congenital malformations or skeletal disorders\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n\n\n\n\nProlonged acidemia\n\n\n\nA fetus in a nonvertex presentation is at increased risk for trauma, cord prolapse, and head entrapment. Malpresentation includes preterm breech presentations and non-frank breech term fetuses.\n\nThe decision to proceed with a cesarean delivery for the term frank breech singleton fetus has been challenged. Although most practitioners will always perform a cesarean delivery in this situation, ACOG has left open the option to consider a breech delivery under the appropriate circumstances, including a practitioner experienced in the evaluation and management of labor and skilled in the delivery of the breech fetus.\n [31]  Some state maternal care collaborative agencies are even implementing tools to decrease the likelihoond of cesarean section in the instance of a breech presentation, with guidelines recommending the formation of a team in the hospital that is trained and confortable with breach and operative deliveries.\n [41] \n\nIf a patient is diagnosed with a fetal malpresentation (ie, breech or transverse lie) after 36 weeks, the option for an external cephalic version is offered to try to convert the fetus to a vertex lie, thus allowing an attempt at a vaginal delivery. An external cephalic version is usually attempted at 36-38 weeks with studies underway to establish the use of performing external cephalic version at 34 weeks’ gestational age.\n\nUltrasonography is performed to confirm a breech presentation. If the fetus is still in a nonvertex presentation, an intravenous (IV) line is started, and the baby is monitored with an external fetal heart rate monitor prior to the procedure to confirm well-being. With a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, the version is attempted.\n\nAn external cephalic version involves trying to externally manipulate the fetus into a vertex presentation. This is accomplished with ultrasonographic guidance to ascertain fetal lie. An attempt is made to manipulate the fetus through either a \"forward roll\" or \"backward roll.\" The overall chance of success is approximately 60%.\n [42] Some practitioners administer an epidural to the patient before attempting version, and others may give the patient a dose of subcutaneous terbutaline (a beta-mimetic used for tocolysis) just before the attempt.\n\nFactors that influence the success of an attempted version include multiparity, a posterior placenta, and normal amniotic fluid with a normally grown fetus. In addition, to be a candidate, a patient must be eligible for an attempted vaginal delivery.\n\nContraindications to external cephalic version inlclude oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction with abnormal doppler or fetal heart tracing, major uterine anomalies, antepartum hemorrhage, abnormal fetal heart tracing, multiparity and rupture of memebrane.\n [43] \n\nRelative contraindications include poor fetal growth or the presence of congenital anomalies. Risks of an external cephalic version include rupture of membranes, labor, fetal injury, and the need for an emergent cesarean delivery due to placental abruption. A recent review reported a severe complication rate of 0.24% and a cesarean section rate secondary to complications of 0.34%.\n [42] \n\nIf the version is successful, the patient is placed on a fetal monitor in close proximity to the labor and delivery unit or in the labor and delivery unit itself. If fetal heart rate testing is reassuring, the patient is discharged to await spontaneous labor, or she may be induced if the fetus is of an appropriate gestational age or the patient has a favorable cervix.\n\nThe first twin in a nonvertex presentation is an indication for a cesarean delivery, as are higher order multiples (triplets or greater). A large body of literature supports both outright cesarean delivery as well as spontaneous breech delivery or extraction of the second twin.\n\nThe decision is made in conjunction with the patient after appropriate counseling regarding the risks and benefits as well as under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of the labor and delivery of a breech fetus.\n [44] Evidence suggests that the rate of severe complications of the second breech twin is independent of the mode of delivery.\n [45] \n\nSeveral congenital anomalies are controversial indications for cesarean delivery; these include fetal neural tube defects (to avoid sac rupture), particularly defects that are larger than 5-6 cm in diameter. One study noted no difference in long-term motor or neurologic outcomes.\n [46] Some authors noted no relationship between mode of delivery and infant outcomes,\n [47] while others have advocated cesarean delivery of all infants with a neural tube defect.\n [48] \n\nCesarean delivery is indicated in certain cases of hydrocephalus with an enlarged biparietal diameter, and some skeletal dysplasias such as type III osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\nWhether or not an outright cesarean delivery should be performed in the setting of a fetal abdominal wall defect (eg, gastroschisis or omphalocele) remains controversial. Most reviews agree that cesarean is not advantageous unless the liver is extruded, which is a very rare event.\n [49, 50, 51] The overall incidence of cesarean delivery in this group of patients is probably due to an increased incidence of intrauterine growth retardation and fetal distress prior to or in labor.\n\nIn the setting of a nonremediable and nonreassuring pattern remote from delivery, a cesarean delivery is recommended to prevent a mixed or metabolic acidemia that could potentially cause significant morbidity and mortality. Electronic fetal monitoring was used in 85% of labors in the United States in 2002.\n [52] Its use has increased the cesarean delivery rate as much as 40%.\n [53] This has occurred without a decrease in the cerebral palsy or perinatal death rate.\n [54] \n\nACOG has recommended that any facility providing obstetric care have the capability of performing a cesarean delivery within 30 minutes of the decision. Despite this recommendation, a decision to delivery time of more than 30 minutes is not necessarily associated with a negative neonatal outcome.\n [55] \n\nAmong patients with first-episode genital herpes infection, the risk of maternal-fetal transmission is 33 times higher than with recurrent outbreaks. The largest population-based study reported that for primary infection, the risk of transmission to the newborn was 35%, compared with a 2% risk for recurrent infection. Among patients with culture-positive herpes, the transmission rate with vaginal delivery was 7 times that with cesarean delivery.\n\nCurrently, all patients with active or symptomatic herpes infection are candidates for cesarean delivery.\n [56] Neonatal infection with herpes can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially with a primary outbreak. With recurrent outbreaks, the risk to the neonate is reduced by the presence of maternal antibodies. Unfortunately, not all women with active viral shedding can be detected upon admission to labor and delivery.\n\nTreatment of women with HIV infections has undergone tremendous change in the past few years. Women with a viral count above 1,000 should be offered cesarean delivery at 38 weeks (or earlier if they go into labor). In women who are being treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), cesarean delivery (before labor or without prolonged rupture of membranes) appears to further lower the risk for neonatal transmission, particularly among those with viral counts above 1,000.\n\nAmong patients with low or undetectable viral counts, the evidence supporting a benefit is not as clear; nevertheless, the patient should be given the option of a cesarean delivery.\n [57] \n\nMaternal and fetal indications\nIndications for cesarean delivery that benefit both the mother and the fetus include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAbnormal placentation\n\n\n\n\nAbnormal labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion\n\n\n\n\nSituations in which labor is contraindicated\n\n\n\nIn the presence of a placenta previa (ie, the placenta covering the internal cervical os), attempting vaginal delivery places both the mother and the fetus at risk for hemorrhagic complications. This complication has actually increased as a result of the increased incidence of repeat cesarean deliveries, which is a risk factor for placenta previa and placenta accreta. Both placenta previa and placenta accreta carry increased morbidity related to hemorrhage and need for hysterectomy.\n [58, 59, 38] \n\nCephalopelvic disproportion can be suspected on the basis of possible macrosomia or an arrest of labor despite augmentation. Many cases diagnosed as cephalopelvic disproportion are the result of a primary or secondary arrest of dilatation or arrest of descent. Predicting true primary or secondary arrest of descent due to cephalopelvic disproportion is best assessed by sagittal suture overlap, but not lambdoid suture overlap, particularly where progress is poor in a trial of labor.\n [60] \n\nContinuing to attempt a vaginal delivery in this setting increases the risk of infectious complications to both mother and fetus from prolonged rupture of membranes.\n [61] Less often, maternal hemorrhagic and fetal metabolic consequences occur from a uterine rupture, especially among patients with a previous cesarean delivery.\n [18] Vaginal delivery can also increase the risk of maternal trauma and fetal trauma (eg, Erb-Duchenne or Klumpke palsy and metabolic acidosis) from a shoulder dystocia.\n [62, 63] \n\nAmong women who have a uterine scar (prior transmural myomectomy or cesarean delivery by high vertical incision), a cesarean delivery should be performed prior to the onset of labor to prevent the risk of uterine rupture, which is approximately 4-10%.\n [18] \n\nContraindications\nThere are few contraindications to performing a cesarean delivery. If the fetus is alive and of viable gestational age, then cesarean delivery can be performed in the appropriate setting.\n\nIn some instances, a cesarean delivery should be avoided. Rarely, maternal status may be compromised (eg, with severe pulmonary disease) to such an extent that an operation may jeopardize maternal survival. In such difficult situations, a care plan outlining when and if to intervene should be made with the family in the setting of a multidisciplinary meeting.\n\nA cesarean delivery may not be recommended if the fetus has a known karyotypic abnormality or known congenital anomaly that may lead to death (anencephaly). However, the physician and the patient must actively discuss all the options prior to making that decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Cesarean Hysterectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nCesarean hysterectomy refers to removal of the uterus at the time of cesarean delivery. It is a technically challenging procedure owing to the anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy, including a massive increase in blood flow to the uterus at term. The surgery’s dramatic nature stems from the fact that it is frequently performed in emergent, unplanned situations when a mother’s life is in danger and because it permanently ends future fertility. The procedure is unfortunately becoming more common largely owing to the rising primary cesarean delivery rate in the United States.\nPostpartum hysterectomy refers to hysterectomy done either after vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery skin closure after cesarean section, whereas cesarean hysterectomy is done in the same surgical case as cesarean delivery. Postpartum hysterectomies are largely unplanned and often done on an emergent basis for obstetric hemorrhage or undiagnosed abnormal placentation.

The lifetime risk of having surgery for prolapse or incontinence by age 80-85 is 11-19%, with 30% of women requiring additional prolapse procedures.\n [1] With the rapid rise in the elderly population, the number of surgeries performed yearly is projected to increase dramatically.\nSurgical intervention for vaginal prolapse can take on multiple approaches. Patients may undergo extensive pelvic reconstructive surgery or simple obliterative procedures. The goal of reconstructive surgery is to restore the normal anatomy, while obliterative surgery is used to correct prolapse by closing off a portion of the vaginal canal, thereby reducing the viscera back into the pelvis. Although complex pelvic surgeries such as abdominal sacrocolpopexy, sacrospinous fixation, or iliococcygeus fixation have high rates of success, they are associated with surgical risks that may render them unsuitable for some elderly patients. Colpocleisis, an obliterative procedure, is a viable alternative for those who cannot tolerate extensive surgery and no longer desire preservation of coital function.\n\n\nThe term colpocleisis is derived from the Greek words kolpos, which means folds or hollow, and cleisis, which means closure. The first report of colpocleisis occurred in 1823 when Gerardin described denuding the anterior and posterior vaginal wall at the introitus and suturing them. The technique currently used, however, is a modification of that first described in 1877 by Leon LeFort.\nIn LeFort’s publication, he describes a partial colpocleisis technique that left the uterus in situ, after which a perineorrhaphy was performed 8 days postoperatively.\n [2, 3] His technique was based on the premise that apposition of the vaginal walls could prevent uterine prolapse and that a widened genital hiatus may lead to unsuccessful outcomes. His theory holds true today; this obliterative procedure is associated with high rates of satisfaction.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Contraceptive Implant Placement": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe contraceptive implant is a popular form of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Norplant, the first contraceptive implant, became available in 1983\n [1] but was later removed from the market owing to patient dissatisfaction with adverse effects that ultimately led to several lawsuits against the manufacturer. It was also difficult to remove.\n [2] \nThe currently available implant, Nexplanon, is a rod that contains the progestin etonogestrel and is intended for subdermal implantation in the non-dominant arm. It is the second-generation of the device; the first-generation was called Implanon. The currently available device differs from its first-generation counterpart in that the implant itself is radiopaque and its applicator design is improved so as to prevent placement deeper than the intended subdermal location.\n\n\nThe advantage of an implantable form of contraception is that it provides effective long-term contraception that does not depend on the recipient’s daily compliance. The implant has become a popular choice among adolescents and young women, and is appropriate for both nulliparous or parous women.\n [3] \nThe most recent generation of implantable devices is the most effective form of birth control available and can usually be inserted by trained practitioners in less than one minute.\n [4, 5, 6, 7] The pregnancy rate with the implant is 0.05%, which is slightly lower than the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (0.2%) and the copper intrauterine device (0.6%).\n [8, 9] \n\n\n\n\nA release rate of 25-30 µg/day of etonogestrel is required to suppress ovulation. With this device, the initial rate of release is 60-70 µg/day, which slowly decreases over time, to about 30 µg/day. Maximum serum levels are attained the fourth day after insertion, on average.\n\n\n\n\nAfter removal of the implant, etonogestrel serum levels become undetectable within one week.\n [1, 6, 10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Culdocentesis": "\nOverview\n\n\nCuldocentesis is a procedure in which peritoneal fluid is obtained from the cul de sac of a female patient. It involves the introduction of a spinal needle through the vaginal wall into the peritoneal space of the pouch of Douglas. Prior to the wide availability of ultrasonography, it was considered particularly valuable in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, at a time when 97% of ectopic pregnancies ruptured before diagnosis.\nRecently, the frequency of tubal rupture has decreased.\n [1] Thus, the incidence of hemoperitoneum has declined, and the use of culdocentesis has decreased. In addition, ultrasonography, with its improved resolution and availability, has virtually replaced culdocenteses as the test of choice. The sensitivity and specificity of echogenic fluid found on ultrasound for establishing hemoperitoneum are both 100%, compared with 66% and 80%, respectively, for culdocentesis, and the negative predictive value of a nondiagnostic culdocentesis is 25% compared to 100% for echogenic fluid in the ectopic pregnancy subgroup of patients. Additional advantages of ultrasonography include its noninvasive nature and the provision of additional information about the pelvis.\n [2] For more information, see Medscape Reference article Ectopic Pregnancy Imaging.\n\n\nAnatomy\nThe pouch of Douglas (recto-uterine pouch) is formed by reflection of the peritoneum between the rectum posteriorly and the posterior surface of the uterus anteriorly. The pouch often contains small intestine and a small amount of peritoneal fluid. It is the most dependent intraperitoneal space in both the upright and the supine position. Blood, pus, and other free fluids in the peritoneal cavity pool in the pouch because of its dependent location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Cystocele Repair": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP), including cystocele, is a major health concern, especially in the elderly. In the United States, more than 200,000 operations are performed annually for POP\n [1] ; reoperation rates reach 30%.\n [2] Anterior vaginal wall prolapse (AWP) is the most common form of female POP, with 81% of prolapse repairs including the anterior vaginal wall.\n [2] Furthermore, AWP carries the highest risk for recurrence, with reported recurrence rates as high as 41%. In this article, we use the term \"cystocele\" to represent AWP.\n\n\nThe vaginal wall is normally supported by strong fascial and ligamentous attachments. Delancey divided vaginal support into the following 3 levels:\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1 - The cardinal-uterosacral ligament complex, which functions as suspensory \"leashes,\" holding the cervix and upper vagina\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2 - The lateral connections of the vagina to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis (ATFP), or \"white line,\" which support the middle portion of the vagina\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 - Fascial connections to the perineal membrane anteriorly and the perineal body posteriorly, which support the lower vagina\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption of 1 or more of these support structures might precipitate POP, including cystocele. Depending on the site of fascial detachment, cystocele can be central (midline defect of the pericervical fascia; about 1% of cases), lateral (detachment of the pericervical fascia from the ATFP; about 80-85% of cases), or apical (detachment from the uterosacral ligaments or the pericervical ring; about 15% of cases). A combination of lateral and central defects is also common. Surgical repair should address these defects accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nThe risk factors for developing POP include age,\n [3] parity, obesity, chronic constipation, hormonal status, previous gynecologic surgery and hysterectomy, chronic obstructive airway disease, smoking, high-impact activity, and genetics.\n\nA patient with cystocele may be asymptomatic, especially in the early stages. Symptomatic patients may experience fullness or pressure in the pelvis or vagina, a \"ball\" or \"lump\" protruding from the vagina, lower back pain or pressure, problems with bladder emptying or bowel movements, dyspareunia, or vaginal bleeding.\n\nUrinary symptoms associated with cystocele include urinary frequency and urgency (35%), urge urinary incontinence (15%), stress urinary incontinence (60%), and difficulty voiding (23%). Urodynamically diagnosed bladder outlet obstruction was found more frequently with higher-stage cystoceles than with lower-stage cystoceles.\n [4] \n\nIn patients with advanced POP, diagnosis of occult stress urinary incontinence is critical. This can be accomplished by means of urodynamic studies, with and without prolapse reduction. The positive cough (Valsalva) stress test after prolapse reduction during urodynamic studies indicates that an anti-incontinence procedure at the time of prolapse repair is necessary.\n [5, 6] Several authors have questioned whether urodynamic evaluation is predictive with regards to outcomes compared to less invasive office evaluations such as cough stress testing.\n\nGuidelines for the management of POP have been developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n [7] \n\nIndications\nProlapse repair is indicated for relief of patient symptoms, restoration of the normal anatomy and function of the pelvic structures, prevention of prolapse recurrence, and repair of concomitant intrapelvic defects. It should be offered to all patients who are symptomatic, are good surgical candidates, and are willing to pursue surgical treatment. A cystocele associated with bladder outlet obstruction is also an indication for surgical correction.\n\nContraindications\nCystocele repair is contraindicated in the following patients:\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients with local vaginal diseases, including vaginitis and neoplasms\n\n\n\n\nPatients who are not surgically fit\n\n\n\n\nPatients who are not willing to undergo surgery\n\n\n\n\nPatients who have early-stage asymptomatic cystoceles\n\n\n\nTechnical considerations\nKey technical considerations include the choice of surgical approach and the adoption of measures to reduce complications. The surgeon should think of anterior wall prolapse rather than bladder prolapse. Other defects of the anterior wall should be addressed.\n\nProcedural planning\nMany surgical procedures have been described for cystocele repair. The surgical approach can be either vaginal or abdominal. The 3 basic techniques for cystocele repair are anterior colporrhaphy, anterior colporrhaphy with graft, and paravaginal repair, of which the first 2 are the most commonly used (see the image below). If apical involvement is noted, cystoceles may often be resolved after resuspension of the apical defect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions for cystocele repair. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe grafts used for cystocele repair are subclassified according to their materials. These materials include autologous tissue (rectus fascia\n [8] , fascia lata, vaginal wall), allografts (fascia lata, dermis, dura mater), xenografts (porcine small intestine submucosa, porcine dermis, bovine pericardium), and synthetic grafts (absorbable and nonabsorbable). Varying success rates have been reported for all of these. Biomaterials seem to work by providing a scaffold for host tissue growth.\n\nThe balance between tissue regrowth and graft dissolution plays a major role in the success of surgical cystocele repair. Synthetic grafts are permanent and, if properly positioned and secured, yield better long-term success rates; however, they are associated with higher risks of infection, extrusion (into the vagina), and erosion (into the bladder and or urethra). When polypropylene mesh is used for cystocele repair, extrusion rates as high as 25% have been reported.\n [9] \n\nGraft anchoring techniques also vary. Free grafts are anchored to the vaginal sulcus with absorbable or permanent sutures. The transobturator approach entails the use of suspension arms passed through the obturator foramen, which suspend the graft through the ATFP. Some other grafts are suspended to the sacrospinous ligaments, which provide apical support as well.\n\nSeveral ready-made kits now on the market make use of the arm suspension concept for graft support. Examples include Perigee and Elevate anterior (American Medical System), Uphold LITE (Boston Scientific), and Prolift Anterior (Ethicon). A population-based study from Scotland evaluated the safety and effectiveness of both anti-incontinence surgery and prolapse repair with and without the use of synthetic mesh.\n [10] \n\nOn July 13, 2011, the FDA issued a statement that serious complications are not rare with the use of surgical mesh in transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse. The FDA reviewed the literature from 1996-2011 to evaluate safety and effectiveness and found surgical mesh in the transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse does not improve symptoms or quality of life more than nonmesh repair. The review found that the most common complication was erosion of the mesh through the vagina, which can take multiple surgeries to repair and can be debilitating in some women. Mesh contraction was also reported, which causes vaginal shortening, tightening, and pain.\n\nIn a Scottish population-based study of more than 16,000 women the safety and effectiveness of both anti-incontinence surgery and prolapse repair with and without the use of synthetic mesh.\n [10] The results support the use of mesh procedures for incontinence. Both vaginal and abdominal mesh procedures for vaginal vault prolapse repair were associated with similar effectiveness and complication rates to non-mesh vaginal repair. However, they found mesh-augmented prolapse repair was associated with a threefold higher risk of long-term complications than non-mesh repairs.\n\nThe FDA’s update states, \"Both mesh erosion and mesh contraction may lead to severe pelvic pain, painful sexual intercourse or an inability to engage in sexual intercourse. Also, men may experience irritation and pain to the penis during sexual intercourse when the mesh is exposed in mesh erosion.\" The FDA issued a final order in January 2016 to reclassify the devices from class II to class III and to require manufacturers to submit a PMA application.\n [11] The FDA is continuing to review the literature regarding surgical mesh in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence and will issue a report at a later date. See the full update regarding surgical mesh in pelvic organ prolapse here: FDA Safety Communication: Update on Serious Complications Associated with Transvaginal Placement of Surgical Mesh for Pelvic Organ Prolapse\n\nOn April 16, 2019, the FDA mandated that all manufacturers of surgical mesh intended for transvaginal repair of anterior compartment prolapse (cystocele) stop selling and distributing their products. The FDA has determined that the vaginal mesh kit manufacturers have not demonstrated reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these devices, which is the premarket standard that now applies to them since the FDA reclassified them into class III (high risk) in 2016.\n [12] \n\nComplication prevention\nGraft-associated infection is a major concern. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis with an antibacterial that covers gram-positive and gram-negative strains is appropriate. Cefotetan is a good choice; gentamicin plus vancomycin combination is an alternative in patients who have penicillin allergies. The authors use a mixture of neomycin sulfate (2 mL in 500 mL of 0.9% NaCl). The graft is also soaked in the same solution before insertion. Cefotetan is a reasonable alternative if the patient is allergic to sulfa.\n\nIn addition to the standard vaginal preparation and draping, the use of an antimicrobial drape (eg, Ioban; 3M) helps isolate the surgical field from the anus and other nearby potential sources of contamination. Intraoperative wound irrigation washes out free clots and tissue debris.\n\nOne of the predisposing factors for infection is the development of a hematoma. The authors ensure intraoperative hemostasis by using both hemostatic sutures and an electrocautery. During vaginal skin closure, the authors intentionally close the proximal part of the incision in a continuous fashion to facilitate hemostasis and close the distal part in an interrupted fashion to allow drainage of any potential bleeding and thus avoid hematoma formation.\n\nPreoperative estrogen therapy has been found to help with intraoperative dissection, promote postoperative healing, and decrease the risk of graft extrusion. The dose of estrogen required for treatment of vaginal atrophy is less than that which would be expected to cause endometrial hyperplasia.\n [13] \n\nPrevious vaginal surgical procedures add to the technical difficulty and increase the risk of bleeding. To minimize this complication, the patient should be evaluated for bleeding risk. All anticoagulant medications should be stopped for 7-10 days before surgery if possible. We routinely check the patient's coagulation profile before surgery.\n\nTo minimize the risk of nerve injury, the patient should be properly positioned in well-padded stirrups, all pressure points should be padded, overlay stretch should be avoided, and retractor blades should be placed under direct vision. Awareness of the neuroanatomy of the female pelvis is critical for recognizing and avoiding the common sites of nerve entrapment.\n\nAs noted (see above), POP is associated with advanced age. The aging population is also at higher risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and the risk increases further with prolonged pelvic surgical procedures in the dorsal lithotomy position. Preoperative anticoagulation with heparin, pneumatic antiembolism stockings, and early postoperative ambulation are the keys to minimizing this critical complication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Diagnostic Dilation and Curettage": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nDiagnostic dilation and curettage was originally intended to detect intrauterine endometrial abnormalities and assist in the management of abnormal bleeding. Newer techniques are available to assess the uterine cavity and endometrial findings.\n [1] However, dilation and curettage still has a role in centers where advanced technology is not available or when other diagnostic modalities are unsuccessful.\n\n\nTraditionally, dilation and curettage has been performed in a blind fashion. The procedure can be performed under ultrasound guidance or in conjunction with visualization of the uterine cavity by a hysteroscope.\nIndications\nDiagnostic dilation and curettage is typically employed to assess endometrial histology. Fractional dilation and curettage also includes assessment of the endocervix and biopsy of the ectocervix and transformation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndications for a diagnostic dilation and curettage include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAbnormal uterine bleeding: irregular bleeding, menorrhagia, suspected malignant or premalignant condition\n\n\n\n\nRetained material in the endometrial cavity\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of intracavitary findings from imaging procedures (abnormal endometrial appearance due to suspected polyps or fibroids)\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and removal of retained fluid from the endometrial cavity (hematometra, pyometra) in conjunction with evaluating the endometrial cavity and relieving cervical stenosis\n\n\n\n\nOffice endometrial biopsy insufficient for diagnosis or failed due to cervical stenosis\n\n\n\n\nEndometrial sampling in conjunction with other procedures (eg, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy)\n\n\n\nThe evaluation of the uterine cavity by dilation and curettage may be helpful when an office technique, such as ultrasound, is unable to fully elucidate the endometrium due to shadowing from leiomyomata, a pelvic mass, or loops of bowel.\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the effectiveness of obtaining endometrial tissue by endometrial sampling versus D&C. One study compared aspiration biopsy (Pipelle) with D&C. The D&C procedure was performed without hysteroscopy. This sample of 673 women underwent hysterectomy following the endometrial sampling or curettage. The concordance of results was 67% between endometrial biopsy and hysterectomy versus 70% between D&C without hysteroscopy and hysterectomy. The negative predictive value was 98% for detection of malignancy. In their conclusions, the authors recommended a presampling evaluation of the endometrium by a technique such as transvaginal ultrasound.\n [2] \n\nAnother study of 366 women evaluated histopathologic findings obtained by hysteroscopically directed biopsies, versus pathology results of tissue obtained at D&C. Concordance of results for the 2 procedures was 88.8%. In their conclusions, the authors stated that although hysteroscopy with directed biopsy was adequate for obtaining diagnosis from focal lesions, it may not be sufficient for diagnosis of all pathologic findings in the endometrium, including hyperplasia. They recommended global endometrial sampling, such as by D&C, be included for more thorough diagnosis.\n [3] \n\nDilation and curettage may also be a therapeutic procedure. Examples of this use include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoval of retained products of conception (eg, incomplete abortion, missed abortion, septic abortion, induced pregnancy termination)\n\n\n\n\nSuction procedures for management of uterine hemorrhage\n\n\n\n\nTreatment and evaluation of gestational trophoblastic disease\n\n\n\n\nHemorrhage unresponsive to hormone therapy\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with endometrial ablation for histologic evaluation of the endometrium\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThere are few contraindications to gentle office dilation and curettage, but a more vigorous examination may require an operative suite with regional or general anesthesia. Paracervical block or intravenous sedation with an anesthesia team standing by for assistance may also be an option. Intolerance to office examinations or procedures may determine the setting for the procedure.\n\nAbsolute contraindications to dilation and curettage include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nViable desired intrauterine pregnancy\n\n\n\n\nInability to visualize the cervical os\n\n\n\n\nObstructed vagina\n\n\n\nRelative contraindications to dilation and curettage include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSevere cervical stenosis\n\n\n\n\nCervical/uterine anomalies\n\n\n\n\nPrior endometrial ablation\n\n\n\n\nBleeding disorder\n\n\n\n\nAcute pelvic infection (except to remove infected endometrial contents)\n\n\n\n\nObstructing cervical lesion\n\n\n\nThese contraindications may be surmounted in some cases. For example, magnetic resonance imaging may define the anatomy of the cervical or uterine anomaly, allowing safe exploration of the endocervix and endometrium.\n\nComplications\nComplications can occur at the time of diagnostic dilation and curettage. Careful performance of the procedure should minimize these events. Possible complications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nBleeding or hemorrhage\n\n\n\n\nCervical laceration\n\n\n\n\nUterine perforation\n\n\n\n\nPostprocedural infection\n\n\n\n\nPostprocedural intrauterine synechiae (adhesions)\n\n\n\n\nAnesthetic complications\n\n\n\nComplications, particularly uterine perforation, may be increased in a patient with a recent pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic disease, prior endometrial ablation, distorted anatomy, cervical stenosis, or current uterine infection.\n\nCervical Injury\n\nLaceration of the cervix primarily occurs during traction, with a counterforce applied during dilation. It seems to occur most frequently with use of a single-tooth tenaculum, especially when it is placed vertically on the lip of the cervix. A Bierer multi-toothed tenaculum penetrates less deeply into the cervical tissue and transfers force over a greater area, potentially decreasing the risk of laceration.\n\nLacerations are generally managed with an interrupted or running interlocking dissolvable suture. The same technique would be applied for a laceration of the posterior cervical lip.\n\nPlacement of a tenaculum is not recommended at the lateral aspect of the cervix because of the location of the cervical branches of the uterine artery.\n\nThe risk of laceration is reduced by reducing force at dilation, using more tapered Pratt dilators or osmotic preparation before the procedure with laminaria or prostaglandin.\n\nUterine Perforation\n\nUterine perforation is one of the more common complications of dilation and curettage. Risks are increased when dealing with a pregnant or recently postpartum uterus (5.1%) and are less frequent at the time of a dilation and curettage remote from pregnancy (0.3% for premenopausal women and 2.6% for postmenopausal women).\n [4, 5, 6] \n\nThe instruments most commonly associated with uterine perforation are the uterine sound or dilators. If perforation is known to have occurred with a blunt instrument, observation of vital and peritoneal signs for several hours is all that is needed. If suspicion that a sharp instrument, such as a curette, has perforated the uterus or if the fat has been retrieved by curettage, then intraabdominal injury must be excluded by laparoscopy. Active bleeding may necessitate a laparotomy.\n\nInfection\n\nInfection related to diagnostic dilation and curettage is rare and is most likely when cervicitis is present at the time of the procedure. One study of infections related to dilation and curettage documented a 5% incidence of bacteremia following dilation and curettage with a very rare incidence of septicemia.\n\nProphylactic antibiotics are not recommended for any dilation and curettage, including for those women who generally require subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis.\n\nIntrauterine Adhesions\n\nCurettage after delivery or abortion may result in endometrial injury and subsequent development of intrauterine adhesions, termed Asherman syndrome. The development of uterine synechiae may also be associated with prior endometrial ablation procedures. Intrauterine adhesions may make future diagnostic curettage more difficult and increase the risk of uterine perforation. Previous procedures such as endometrial ablation may also increase the risk of cervical stenosis.\n\nA study by Hooker et al reported that intrauterine application of auto-crosslinked hyaluronic acid gel after D&C for miscarriage in women with at least one previous D&C may reduce the incidence and severity of intrauterine adhesions, however, it does not eliminate the process of adhesion formation completely. Further studies are needed to evaluate these results.\n [7] \n\nTrophoblastic Embolization\n\nEmbolization of trophoblastic tissue in the systemic circulation is a very rare complication of dilation and curettage for removal of gestational trophoblastic disease. This event has been associated with thyroid storm, cardiovascular collapse, and death. A diagnostic dilation and curettage in patients for whom gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is suspected should be performed in an operating room with anesthesia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Diagnostic Hysteroscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nDiagnostic hysteroscopy is a commonly performed gynecologic procedure to evaluate the endometrial cavity. This article focuses on the procedure of diagnostic hysteroscopy. Other excellent Medscape Reference articles include an overview of hysteroscopy by Drs. Petrozza and Attaman and operative hysteroscopy by Drs. Crochet, Yeh, and Price.\nBroadly, 2 systems of diagnostic hysteroscopy exist: panoramic (also known as direct optical) and contact (also known as contact microhysteroscopy). Modern references to hysteroscopy usually imply a panoramic technique in which the uterine cavity is distended with liquid or gas and evaluated with the hysteroscope. Contact hysteroscopy is a related procedure in which no distending media is used and the hysteroscope is passed directly into the uterus and put in gentle contact with the endometrial lining to obtain maximum magnification. Only tissue that is in direct contact with the distal tip can be inspected and evaluated. External light sources can be used but some descriptions of the procedure rely only on ambient light.\n [1] This technique is much slower, and the blunt trauma to the uterine cavity can lead to higher rates of uterine perforations.\n\n\nAn image depicting diagnostic hysteroscopy can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic and hysteroscopic view of the cervical canal and uterine cavity.

        "Dilation and Curettage With Suction": "\nOverview\n\n\nDilation and curettage with suction is a procedure in which contents from the inside of the uterus are evacuated. \"Dilation\" refers to the opening of the cervix. \"Curettage\" refers to the aspiration or removal of tissue within the uterus with an instrument called a curette. This procedure is commonly performed as a treatment for miscarriage, retained placenta after vaginal delivery, or as a method of first-trimester elective abortion.\nRelevant anatomy\nThe uterus is a dynamic female reproductive organ that is responsible for several reproductive functions, including menses, implantation, gestation, labor, and delivery. It is responsive to the hormonal milieu within the body, which allows adaptation to the different stages of a woman’s reproductive life. The uterus adjusts to reflect changes in ovarian steroid production during the menstrual cycle and displays rapid growth and specialized contractile activity during pregnancy and childbirth. It can also remain in a relatively quiescent state during the prepubertal and postmenopausal years. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Uterus Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Endometrial Ablation": "\nBackground\n\n\nEndometrial ablation is an outpatient procedure that removes or destroys the endometrial layers. The opposing walls of the myometrium collapse onto each other, and the damaged tissue contracts and develops into a scar.\n [1] Any endometrium remaining after the ablation is trapped beneath the scar, preventing further bleeding. Estimation of the number of endometrial ablations performed each year is difficult, because many are performed in the office setting.\nEndometrial ablation is performed to reduce menstrual bleeding, such as menorrhagia. Menorrhagia is menstrual bleeding that is heavy in amount or duration and that occurs at regular intervals. Loss of more than 80 mL of blood per menstrual cycle is considered abnormal. Menorrhagia affects approximately 10-30% of premenopausal women and up to 50% of perimenopausal women. Abnormal bleeding is a common reason for outpatient gynecologic visits and is one of the most common causes for surgery among women.\n\n\nIn the past, hysterectomy was the most common surgical treatment for menorrhagia; 10% of hysterectomies are performed for menstrual disorders. Although endometrial ablation is not a pure substitute for hysterectomy, it offers patients a fast, outpatient procedure, with little to no postoperative downtime; It also affords a reasonable surgical option for those patients who have failed, declined, or are ineligible for medical therapy, and who also desire to avoid hysterectomy.\n [2, 3, 4, 5] \nThe etiology of menorrhagia may not always be known, but endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma must be excluded as the cause of bleeding before proceeding to the endometrial ablation.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the first medical literature reports of endometrial destructive procedures are older than 100 years, widespread adoption of this modality did not occur until the advent of hysteroscopically guided techniques.\n [2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Until the mid-1990s, hysteroscopically guided ablation (resectoscopic endometrial ablation [REA]) using laser, fulguration, or vaporization techniques was the most common approach.\n [11, 12, 13, 14] \n\n\n\n\nSince then, global endometrial ablation (GEA) devices, developed to treat all areas of the endometrial cavity simultaneously or with minimal manipulation of the device, have simplified the application of endometrial ablation and extended the location of the procedure to the office setting. These devices require less operator time and training to achieve excellent results. To date, 5 GEA devices have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for minimally invasive treatment of idiopathic menorrhagia (see Equipment).\n\nGEA techniques have improved the ease with which gynecologic surgeons can effectively treat abnormal uterine bleeding of benign origin. Improvements in these devices have come quickly, including the ability to treat submucosal fibroids and irregularly shaped endometrial cavities. The high overall success and patient satisfaction rates reported with GEA techniques make them a viable option for conservative surgical management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

The purported short-term benefits for the parturient included its ease of repair compared to a spontaneous perineal laceration, decreased postpartum pain, and reduction in severe or third- or fourth-degree lacerations.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional long-term benefits were believed to accrue from shortening the time for which the perineum was stretched during birth, including prevention of pelvic floor relaxation, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual dysfunction, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The purported benefits to the neonate included prevention of asphyxia, cranial trauma, and cerebral hemorrhage, as well as reduction of the risk of shoulder dystocia.\n\n\n\n\nDespite a lack of supporting data, episiotomy was widely adopted into obstetric practice after 1920 and came to be considered standard of care by many American obstetric care providers. By 1979, episiotomy was performed in approximately 63% of all deliveries in the United States, with higher rates among nulliparas.\n [3] In Great Britain in the same era, episiotomy rates ranged from 14-96% among nulliparas and from 16-71% among multiparas.\n [4] \n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, however, obstetric providers began to question the routine use of episiotomy. A growing body of evidence began to emerge that demonstrated the potential consequences of episiotomy, including increased risk of extension to severe perineal lacerations, dyspareunia, and future pelvic floor dysfunction.\n\nAs a result, the use of episiotomy has decreased from its 20th-century peak. For example, the number of episiotomies performed annually in the United States fell from over 1.6 million in 1992 to 716,000 in 2003 as a more restricted use of the procedure was adopted.\n [5, 6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Evaluation of Gestation": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe estimation of pregnancy dates is important for the mother, who wants to know when to expect the birth of her baby, and for her health care providers, so they may choose the times at which to perform various screening tests and assessments,\n [1] such as serum screening, assessment of maturity, and induction of labor for postdate pregnancies.\nThe 3 basic methods used to help estimate gestational age (GA) are menstrual history, clinical examination, and ultrasonography. The first 2 are subject to considerable error and should only be used when ultrasonography facilities are not available. The date of feeling the first fetal movements (quickening) is far too unreliable to be useful. The date of the first documented positive pregnancy test and the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) level may help ascertain the minimum gestational age. In women who conceived following assisted reproduction techniques, the date of embryo transfer is known and may date the pregnancy accurately. In rare cases, the date of coitus is known, and this may be useful in calculating the length of pregnancy.\n\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends ultrasound measurement during the first trimester (up to and including 13 6/7 weeks of gestation) as the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age. If assisted reproductive technology (ART) was involved in the pregnancy, ACOG recommends that the ART-derived gestational age should be used to determine the estimated due date (EDD). According to ACOG, as soon as data from the last menstrual period (LMP), the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are available, the gestational age and the EDD should be determined.\n [2] \nFor related information, see Medscape's Pregnancy Resource Center.\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\nGestational age (GA) refers to the length of pregnancy after the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) and is usually expressed in weeks and days. This is also known as menstrual age. Conceptional age (CA) is the true fetal age and refers to the length of pregnancy from the time of conception. This terminology does vary geographically and over time, and it may need clarification if not explicitly defined in relevant articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "External Cephalic Version": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nExternal cephalic version (ECV) is a procedure that externally rotates the fetus from a breech presentation to a cephalic presentation. Successful version of a breech into cephalic presentation allows women to avoid cesarean delivery, which is currently the largest contributing factor to the incidence of postpartum maternal morbidity.\n [1, 2] \n\n\nBreech presentation occurs in 3-4% of all term pregnancies.\n [3, 4] Breech presentation ranks as the third most frequent indication for cesarean section, following previous cesarean section and labor dystocia. More than 90% of breech fetuses are delivered by planned cesarean section.\n [5, 6] Approximately 12% of cesarean deliveries in the United States are performed for breech presentation, not including repeat cesarean sections secondary to a history of a prior cesarean indicated for breech presentation.\nSince the results of the Term Breech Trial\n [7] recommended cesarean section for breech fetuses at term, ECV has resurfaced as a valuable maneuver.\n [8] ECV enjoyed great popularity in the 1970s, although its use decreased after reports of increased perinatal mortality associated with the procedure. These cases may have been caused by undue force being applied to the maternal abdomen, as well as the concomitant perception of planned cesarean section as a safer alternative to ECV or breech vaginal delivery.\n [3, 4] \n\n\n\n\nECV has been clearly shown to decrease the incidence of breech presentation at term, thereby reducing the cesarean section rate.\n [3] The safety of ECV, described later in this article, has been well-studied and confirmed. In accordance with the recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Dutch Society for Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Royal Dutch Organization for Midwives, ECV should be available and offered to all women near term with breech presentation who do not have any contraindications to the procedure.\n [3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] In the properly selected patient, ECV is considered to be a safe and effective procedure to convert babies from breech to vertex presentation.\n [14] \n\n\n\n\nCesarean section is considered the largest contributing factor to maternal morbidity after childbirth\n [8] and routine use of ECV could potentially reduce the rate of cesarean delivery by about two thirds.\n [6] The use of tocolytics and regional anesthesia should be offered to all women who desire an external cephalic version.\n\nIndications\nBarring contraindications, ECV is recommended by several national organizations for all women with an uncomplicated singleton fetus in breech presentation at term to improve their chances of having a cephalic vaginal birth,\n [15] including ACOG, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Dutch Society for Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Royal Dutch Organization for Midwives. ECV should be available and offered to all women near term with breech presentation who do not have any contraindications to the procedure.\n [3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] \n\nBreech fetal presentation occurs when the fetal vertex is in the fundus of the uterus with the buttocks, legs, or feet presenting. There are four types of breech presentations:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank breech occurs when the fetus’s legs are extended up to its head and the buttocks only are the presenting fetal part\n\n\n\n\nComplete breech occurs when the fetus’s hips and knees are flexed but the feet do not extend below the fetal buttocks\n\n\n\n\nIncomplete breech occurs when one or both hips are extended resulting in one or both feet or knees falling below the breech, so that the knee or foot is the presenting part\n\n\n\n\nFootling breech occurs when one or both legs are extended below the fetus’s buttocks\n\n\n\nWhile the etiology of a breech presentation is not always clear, there are both fetal and maternal factors that can be causative. If there is more relative room for the fetus to move around, then there is a greater chance of malpresentation. Prematurity is the most common factor associated with malpresentation due to a smaller fetus and a relatively larger volume of amniotic fluid. As pregnancy continues and the volume of amniotic fluid diminishes in relationship to fetal size, the fetus is usually found in a presentation that allows the least constriction, that is, a longitudinal orientation with the buttocks and flexed thighs in the uterine fundus.\n\nSimilarly, polyhydramnios is associated with a higher rate of malpresentation. High parity is also a risk factor for breech presentation of the fetus due to a more spacious and lax uterine cavity. Conversely, if there is too little room for a fetus to move or the fetus is unable to move adequately, then a fetus in breech presentation may not be able to rotate into a cephalic presentation prior to delivery.\n\nExamples of anatomical restraints that may restrict fetal movement into the vertex presentation include extended fetal legs, placental implantation (cornual or previa), contracted maternal pelvis, mullerian duct anomalies, leiomyomata, tumors, certain fetal anomalies (hydrocephaly, sacrococcygeal teratoma), and multiple gestation.\n [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] \n\nA fetus that has altered mobility, such as with fetal neurologic impairments, myotonic dystrophy, or short umbilical cord, is less likely to move into the vertex presentation.\n [21, 22] \n\nContraindications\nContraindications to ECV exist either when the procedure may put the fetus in jeopardy or when the procedure is very unlikely to succeed. Clearly, if cesarean delivery is indicated for reasons other than breech presentation, ECV is contraindicated.\n [23] Placenta previa or abruptio placentae, nonreassuring fetal status, intrauterine growth restriction in association with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler index, isoimmunization, severe preeclampsia, recent vaginal bleeding, and significant fetal or uterine anomalies are also contraindications for ECV.\n\nOther contraindications to ECV include ruptured membranes, fetus with a hyperextended head, and multiple gestations, although ECV may be considered for a second twin after delivery of the first.\n\nRelative contraindications include maternal obesity, small for gestational age fetus (less than 10%), and oligohydramnios because they make successful ECV less likely.\n [24] Previous uterine scar from cesarean delivery or myomectomy may also be a relative contraindication for ECV.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nWe recommend that all ECV attempts be performed on the labor and delivery unit, with an operating room available if an emergency cesarean becomes necessary. In addition, labor and delivery provides easy access to fetal monitoring, anesthesia, and phlebotomy for maternal Rh status and blood count.\n\nProcedure Planning\n\nPrior to the procedure, fetal testing with a nonstress test or biophysical profile should be completed and reassuring fetal status should be documented. A bedside ultrasound should assess fetal position, amniotic fluid level, placenta location, and uterine cavity shape to help determine if the procedure should be performed and the likelihood of success. After the ultrasound assessment and fetal testing, informed consent should be obtained, taking in to account the information gathered from the fetal testing and ultrasound.\n\nOutcomes\nBreech presentation is associated with fetal abnormalities and, in and of itself, can be a marker for poor perinatal outcome. The incidence of childhood handicap following breech presentation has been found to be as high as 16% regardless of mode of delivery. It is unknown whether vaginal delivery of the breech fetus or abnormalities innate to the breech fetus are responsible for the perinatal outcome.\n [3] \n\nSuccessful ECV is defined as conversion from malpresentation to cephalic presentation at the time of the procedure. The reported success rate of ECV ranges from 35 to 86%, with a commonly quoted figure of 50%.\n [3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] \n\nDespite the low success rate, women who underwent ECV had a significant reduction in both noncephalic births and cesarean delivery compared to women who did not undergo ECV.\n [3] Barring contraindications, both ACOG and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend offering ECV as an intervention for breech presentation at term.\n\nEven with this recommendation, the percentage of women who are appropriate candidates for ECV who are not offered an attempt ranges from 4-33%.\n [9, 10] Moreover, of those who are offered ECV, reported rates of maternal refusal range from 18% to 76%.\n [10, 11, 12, 13] \n\nWith a 50% chance of successful ECV, 72.3% in multiparous women and 46.1% in nulliparous women, uncertainty about the success of attempted ECV likely explains the hesitancy of providers to offer the maneuver as well as maternal declination of this procedure.\n [25] In order to better counsel patients and providers on the likelihood of successful ECV, several factors such as parity, placental location, amniotic fluid index, and type of breech presentation have been studied.\n [26] \n\nFactors that predict the outcome of ECV in breech pregnancies at term can be divided into clinical prognosticators, those that can be elicited from a history and physical examination, and ultrasound prognosticators.\n\nClinical prognosticators predictive of successful ECV include the following:\n [24] \n\n\n\n\n\nMultiparity\n\n\n\n\nNonengagement of the presenting fetal part into the maternal pelvis\n\n\n\n\nRelaxed uterus\n\n\n\n\nPalpable fetal head\n\n\n\n\nMaternal weight less than 65 kg\n\n\n\nAll of these prognostic features lend to increased mobility of the fetus and better access to the fetus for the physician performing the procedure.\n\nUltrasonographic factors associated with successful ECV include the following\n [27, 28] :\n\n\n\n\n\nAmniotic fluid index greater than 10 cm\n\n\n\n\nPosterior placenta\n\n\n\n\nLateral fetal spine position (facilitating operator’s ability to flex the fetal head and thereby form a more compact fetal mass)\n\n\n\n\nComplete breech fetal presentation\n\n\n\nKok et al proposed a prediction model that discriminated between women with poor chance of successful ECV (less than 20%) and good chance of success (greater than 60%) in breech pregnancies after 36 weeks gestational age. While this model has yet to be validated externally, it demonstrated that the prognosticators of multiparity, increasing maternal age, increasing estimated fetal weight until 3000 g, lateral placenta location, nonfrank breech presentation, and normal amniotic fluid (amniotic fluid index greater than 10 cm) were significantly associated with successful ECV.\n [26] \n\nA prospective study conducted in Germany by Zielbauer et al demonstrated an overall success rate of 22.4% for ECV among 353 patients with a singleton fetus in breech presentation. ECV was performed at 38 weeks of gestation. Factors found to increase the likelihood of success were a later week of gestation, abundant amniotic fluid, fundal and anterior placental location, and an oblique lie.\n [29] \n\nFactors associated with reduced success of ECV include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nNulliparity\n\n\n\n\nFirm maternal abdominal muscles\n\n\n\n\nTense or contracting uterus\n\n\n\n\nAnterior or cornual placenta\n\n\n\n\nDecreased amniotic fluid volume (amniotic fluid index less than 10 cm)\n\n\n\n\nRuptured membranes\n\n\n\n\nLow birth weight\n\n\n\n\nPresenting fetal part engaged into the maternal pelvis\n\n\n\n\nMaternal obesity\n\n\n\n\nNonpalpable fetal head\n\n\n\n\nPosteriorly located fetal spine\n\n\n\n\nFetal abdominal circumference below the fifth percentile\n\n\n\nThese factors decrease the likelihood of a successful ECV because they either make it more difficult for the physician to manipulate the fetus (maternal obesity and small fetus) or they decrease mobility of the fetus.\n\nSuccessful ECV is significantly less likely in nulliparous women. This is explained by the increased abdominal wall musculature and uterine tone when compared to parous women. It is hypothesized that increased tone in the uterus and abdominal wall in nulliparous women could predispose to extended fetal legs and therefore frank breech presentation, an independent factor that lessens the chance of successful version. Ferguson et al noted that even when tocolytics were used routinely with attempted ECV, uterine relaxation in nulliparous women was rarely as complete as that achieved in parous women.\n [27] \n\nPlacental position may alter the intrauterine shape, lessening the space available for the traditional \"forward roll\" or \"backward flip\" used to rotate the fetus into cephalic presentation. Thus, cornual placentation is also associated with a lower rate of successful ECV.\n [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] \n\nThere are two additional procedural factors that are associated with decreased success rates. Higher levels of pain with ECV attempts are more likely to occur when greater force is applied, which is thought to indicate that the presenting fetal part is engaged and not turning readily.\n [3] In addition, ECV is abandoned earlier when pain is reported.\n [27, 30] Similarly, ECV is less successful when multiple attempts are made to turn the fetus. Again, the number of unsuccessful attempts at turning a fetus is frequently related to a fetus being more engaged in the maternal pelvis or other factors that decrease mobility of the fetus.\n [3] \n\nECV after Prior Cesarean Section\nAlthough no large studies have evaluated the safety of ECV following cesarean delivery, several smaller case series have supported its use.\n [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] The controversy over ECV after cesarean is twofold. First, it is unknown what effect the abdominal manipulations of ECV have on a uterine scar. Second, although the current ACOG recommendation supports vaginal birth after cesarean, a physiologic risk to uterine integrity similar to ECV, many practitioners remain uncomfortable with this practice.\n [3] \n\nIn their prospective cohort study and review of the literature, Abenhaim et al found an overall success rate of ECV in women with a previous cesarean to be 50% from their data, and an overall success rate from the pooled literature of 71%. Given rates of success similar to women without a previous cesarean section, they concluded that concern over the success and safety of ECV in women with prior cesarean section is unwarranted and should not deter an attempt at ECV. Adverse outcomes were not addressed in this study.\n [14] \n\nFlamm et al reported a 92% success rate among 56 patients with a previous cesarean section who attempted ECV without serious maternal or neonatal complications.\n [32] Schachter et al. reported success in all 11 ECV attempts after cesarean section when ritodrine was used to promote uterine relaxation. The only reported abnormality in that study was a fetal heart rate tracing with transient tachycardia in one fetus after the procedure that resolved after 30 minutes. All uterine scars, when examined either at surgery or by postpartum manual uterine exploration, showed no signs of dehiscence.\n [37] \n\nIn their case report of 38 women, Meeus et al reported a 65.8% success rate and no uterine ruptures in those women with previous cesarean who attempted ECV. There was one episode of vaginal bleeding after ECV, but after elective repeat cesarean, no placental abruption was noted and there were no adverse outcomes to mother or baby. All women who delivered vaginally after successful version (76%) underwent immediate postpartum examination to evaluate the uterine scar and no uterine ruptures were noted, but one uterine scar dehiscence was noted at the time of elective cesarean section performed 24 hrs after failed ECV. The study concluded that, after fetal weight assessment by clinical examination and ultrasonography, clinical examination of the pelvis and well-documented indications for prior cesarean delivery, ECV is acceptable and effective in women with a prior low transverse uterine scar.\n [38] \n\nUltimately, larger randomized trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Fallopian Tube Reconstruction": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe fallopian tubes are symmetrical paired tubular organs that connect the peritoneal cavity to the endometrium in the uterine cavity. The fallopian tubes are more than simple conduits or \"open pipes.\" The fallopian tubes capture the ovum after ovulation and serve as a conduit for its travel toward the uterus. Fertilization of the egg by the sperm occurs in the fallopian tube. Following fertilization, the zygote develops into an embryo and continues to travel through the fallopian tube into the uterine cavity, where it implants in the endometrium. The fallopian tubes provide the environment and conditions for conception and for the early development of the conceptus.\nFurthermore, the ovum, zygote, and embryo have no intrinsic motility. The fallopian tube is both the conduit and the transporter of the ovum and the early conceptus. Tubal function also aids transport of sperm to the site of fertilization. The fallopian tubes are thus essential and necessary in normal, natural, unassisted reproduction in women.\n\n\nThe multiple and complex functions of the fallopian tubes can be affected by disease, resulting in infertility and, in extreme cases, sterility. Fallopian tube reconstruction has been the traditional method of restoring reproductive function to women with tubal infertility. Today, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) bypass the fallopian tubes in the reproductive process and are additional options in the treatment of these patients.\nFor more information, see Medscape's Pregnancy Resource Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Intrauterine Device Extraction": "\nBackground\n\n\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) are highly effective reversible contraceptives.\n [1] Intrauterine contraception is an increasingly popular choice for women seeking long-term pregnancy prevention.\n [2] In addition, IUDs are among the most cost-effective options for reversible contraception, and overall patient satisfaction with this method is high.\n [3, 4] \nThree intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been approved by the FDA in the United States: the Mirena intrauterine device, the Skyla intrauterine device, and the ParaGard (T380A intrauterine copper contraceptive). Mirena and Skyla contain levonorgestrel (a progestin) that is released up to 3 years (Skyla) or 5 years (Mirena).\n\n\nThe levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are the most effective IUD available, with a 0.2% pregnancy rate at 1 year of use for Mirena\n [1] and a 0.9% pregnancy rate after 2 years of use for Skyla.\n [5] Each levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system consists of a T-shaped polyethylene frame with a hormone reservoir that contains either 52 mg (Mirena) or 13.5 mg (Skyla) of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel is initially released at a rate of 20 ug/day and decreases to 11 ug/day after 5 years for Mirena.\n [6] Skyla releases 13.5 mg of levonorgestrel at a rate of 14 ug/day after 24 days following insertion. The release rate declines to 5 ug/day after 3 years.\n [5] \nThe mechanism of action of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is thought to be multifactorial. The levonorgestrel is thought to cause endometrial suppression and changes in cervical mucus that render the intrauterine environment inhospitable for pregnancy.\n [7, 8] In addition, the physical presence of the IUD causes alterations in ovum and sperm migration and potential damage to the fertilized embryo prior to implantation.\n [9] The most common complaints voiced by women using the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system are irregular spotting, which commonly occurs in the months following placement, amenorrhea, and pain.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nThe copper T380A IUD is also highly efficacious, with a 0.8% pregnancy rate at one year of use.\n [1] It consists of a T-shaped polyethylene frame that is wrapped with a copper wire. It is approved for contraception for a 10-year interval, after which time it should be removed and a new device placed. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to the physical presence of the IUD, which interferes with sperm and ovum transport and potentially damages the ovum or the embryo prior to implantation.\n [9] The most common side effects of Copper T380A IUD use are bleeding and pain.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\nIn general, IUD insertion and removal are both outpatient office procedures intended to be performed by trained health care providers. This objective of this review is to outline IUD removal and discuss issues relevant to this procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Intrauterine Device Insertion": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nIntrauterine device insertion is an outpatient procedure that should be performed by trained healthcare professionals. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are an effective and increasingly popular form of reversible contraception.\n [1, 2] The increase in popularity has been attributed to their efficacy, ease of reversibility, and patient satisfaction, with minimal effort required for long-term use.\n [3, 4] IUDs are equivalent to tubal sterilization at preventing pregnancy; in addition to vasectomy, they are the most cost-effective method of long-term contraception available in the United States.\n [5, 6] The IUDs currently available in the United States include the copper T380A IUD (Paraguard) and 2 levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (Mirena and Skyla).\n\n\nIndications\nThe World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed guidelines for practitioners regarding IUD use in a variety of clinical circumstances.\n [7, 8] IUDs are considered appropriate for the majority of women, including nulliparous women and adolescents. Both immediate postpartum insertion (within 10 minutes of placental delivery) and delayed postpartum insertion (within 4 weeks of placental delivery) are acceptable. Similarly, postabortion (spontaneous or elective) insertion is acceptable.\n\n\n\n\nIUD use is safe in women with the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of an ectopic pregnancy\n\n\n\n\nHistory of pelvic surgery\n\n\n\n\nHypertension or other forms of heart disease\n\n\n\n\nHistory of deep venous thrombosis\n\n\n\n\nHistory of migraine headaches\n\n\n\n\nAnemia\n\n\n\n\nDiabetes\n\n\n\n\nEndometriosis\n\n\n\n\nSmoking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, women with a history of sexually transmitted infections or a history of pelvic inflammatory disease may safely use an IUD, provided they have been treated and a test of cure has been obtained.\n [7, 8, 9] .\n\nContraindications\nAbsolute contraindications for IUD use include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPregnancy\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly distorted uterine anatomy\n\n\n\n\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding concerning for pregnancy or pelvic malignancy\n\n\n\n\nGestational trophoblastic disease with persistently elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels\n\n\n\n\nOngoing pelvic infection\n\n\n\nOngoing pelvic infections (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, untreated cervicitis, puerperal sepsis, immediate postabortion or postpartum infection, endomyometritis, pelvic tuberculosis) are also absolute contraindications for IUD placement.\n [8, 7] In women with these infections, placement should be deferred for 3 months after treatment and a physical examination should be performed prior to insertion to exclude any evidence of persistent infection.\n [10] \n\nIn general, women with a new diagnosis of cervical cancer should not receive IUDs. Although the World Health Organization and the CDC do not recommend the use of IUDs in women with a new diagnosis of endometrial cancer,\n [7, 8] there are observational studies and case reports suggesting that the 52 mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) may be an acceptable alternative for treatment in women who strongly desire fertility.\n [11, 12] \n\nThe levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer or in women with a benign or malignant liver tumor.\n\nThe copper T380A IUD is contraindicated in women with a known copper allergy or in women with Wilson disease.\n [12, 11] \n\nComplications\nComplications from IUD placement are relatively rare. The most common complication is IUD expulsion, which occurs in approximately 2-10% of cases.\n [5] Patients should be encouraged to feel for their IUD strings on a regular basis at home to ensure correct placement. Placement in the immediate postpartum period is associated with a higher expulsion rate than delayed postpartum insertion.\n [13] Similarly, insertion immediately following first and second trimester spontaneous or elective abortion is also associated with a higher expulsion rate than delayed insertion.\n [14] There are, however, numerous advantages to postprocedural and postpartum insertion, which may outweigh the risk of expulsion (see Timing of Insertion).\n\nMethod failure is an exceedingly uncommon complication of IUD use. The 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) has a failure rate of 0.2% in the first year of use. The 13.5-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Skyla) has a failure rate of 0.4% in the first year of use.\n [15] The copper T380A IUD has a 1-year failure rate of 0.8%.\n [5] When pregnancy does occur following IUD placement, the pregnancy is more likely to be ectopic.\n [16] The World Health Organization and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration both recommend IUD removal if pregnancy occurs. Pregnancies that persist with an IUD in place are associated with high risk of complications, including spontaneous abortion and septic abortion.\n [17, 9] \n\nAnother uncommon complication of IUD placement is uterine perforation, which occurs in 0.1% of cases.\n [18] Severe pain or loss of resistance with sounding for IUD insertion are signs of perforation. If perforation is suspected, the procedure should be stopped and postponed. The patient’s vital signs should be assessed to identify and signs of hemorrhage. If any of these signs are evident, the patient should be transported to an emergency facility rapidly.\n\nRarely, a patient may experience a vasovagal episode as a result of cervical or uterine manipulation. If this occurs, the procedure should be stopped and patient’s condition managed appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Intrauterine Pressure Catheter Placement": "\nBackground\n\n\nAn intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) is a device placed into the amniotic space during labor in order to measure the strength of uterine contractions.\nExternal tocodynamometers are used to measure tension across the abdominal wall and detect only contraction frequency and duration. The appearance of contractions by external monitoring may be affected not only by contraction strength but also by maternal habitus, position, gestational age, and monitor location on the abdomen.\n\n\nIntrauterine pressure catheters work by directly measuring pressure within the amniotic space using a pressure transducer at the tip of the catheter which allows for quantification of contraction strength. After connection to the appropriate cable, contractions are measured in mm Hg and displayed on the monitor in a graphic fashion (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\nIUPC tracing \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an intrauterine pressure catheter in place, Montevideo units (MVUs) can be calculated to assess for adequacy of labor in cases of suspected labor dystocia or during labor induction. MVUs are calculated by subtracting the baseline uterine pressure from the peak uterine pressure of each contraction in a 10-minute window of time and then taking the sum of these pressures. Two hundred Montevideo units or more is considered adequate for normal labor progression.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nRoutine use of intrauterine pressure catheters is not recommended. A large randomized trial of internal versus external tocodynamometry for monitoring labor showed no difference in rates of operative delivery or fetal outcomes between the two groups. Internal tocodynamometry is more costly and more invasive and thus should be reserved for specific circumstances (see Indications).\n [2, 3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Hysterectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nHysterectomies are one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States. There has been a slow but steady decline in hysterectomies performed annually in recent years, decreasing from approximately 555,000 in 2016 to about 517,000 in 2018.\n [1] For decades, abdominal and vaginal approaches accounted for the vast majority of hysterectomies. The advent of better laparoscopic technology resulted in the first total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) in 1989. Over the past 30 years, laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy (minimally invasive hysterectomy or MIH) has become the most common surgical approach. TLH accounted for 9.9% of all hysterectomies in 1997 and 11.8% in 2003.\n [2]  In 2018, MIH accounted for 65.8% of hysterectomies.\n [1] \nA TLH is defined by the laparoscopic ligation of the ovarian arteries and veins with the removal of the uterus vaginally or abdominally, along with laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff. This is in contrast to other methods of removing the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. A laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is completed in a similar fashion, with the exception that the cervix is amputated after occluding the ascending vascular pedicles. A laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomy (LAVH), a precursor to the TLH, is a technique to secure the ovarian and uterine vasculature via laparoscopy; the remainder of the procedure is completed vaginally.\n\n\nThe laparoscope is often reinserted after closure of the vaginal cuff to inspect the abdomen and vaginal cuff for adequate hemostasis at the end of the procedure. This procedure requires adequate uterine descent to safely complete the vaginal portion of the procedure. Laparoscopic radical hysterectomy has emerged as an alternative to abdominal radical hysterectomy for patients with stage I cervical cancer.\n [3] Emerging advancements include robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy,\n [4, 5, 6] single-incision laparoscopy, and laparoscopic pelvic reconstruction surgery.\nThe advantages of TLH compared to abdominal hysterectomy are well documented. Visualization of pelvic anatomy and the ability to minimize blood loss is superior with TLH. Substantial and dynamic access to the uterine vessels, vagina, and rectum is possible from many angles, especially after introduction of the uterine manipulator in 1995. The advantages of TLH have been firmly established to include reduced short-term morbidity (less blood loss, wound infections, and postoperative pain), shorter hospital stay, and faster resumption of normal activities when compared with abdominal hysterectomy. The primary focus of this chapter is to review the indications, surgical technique, and advantages of TLH for women who are candidates for a hysterectomy.\n\n\n\n\nAn image depicting female reproductive anatomy can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale reproductive organs, sagittal section. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Laparoscopic Tubal Ligation": "\nBackground\n\n\nLaparoscopic tubal ligation is a surgical sterilization procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes are either clamped and blocked or severed and sealed. Both methods prevent eggs from being fertilized. Tubal ligation is a permanent method of sterilization.\nAbout 20% of women choose tubal ligation as their contraceptive method, making it the second most common form of female contraception in the United States.\n [1] The use of tubal ligation increases with parity: 59% of women who have had 3 children undergo sterilization versus 13% after 1 child. Of women who decide not to have more children, 44% choose sterilization over reversible contraceptive methods.\n [2] \n\n\nThe number of tubal ligation procedures performed in the United States has recently declined somewhat. This decline is thought to be attributable to the introduction of more options for long-acting reversible contraception, an aging baby-boomer population, and access-to-care issues.\nTubal ligation can be performed in the peripartum period or at any time remote from pregnancy (referred to as interval sterilization). Approximately half of female sterilizations are interval sterilizations, and the other half are performed at the time of cesarean delivery or immediately postpartum. Most interval sterilizations are performed laparoscopically.\n\n\n\n\nLaparoscopic tubal ligation has many advantages that explain its use as the interval procedure of choice. It offers the opportunity to explore pelvic and abdominal anatomy, especially if the patient has complaints such as pelvic pain. The procedure is an outpatient surgery with a rapid recovery, allowing patients to return quickly to work or home. All laparoscopic methods are immediately effective. Laparoscopic tubal ligation is attractive to surgeons because many gynecologists are well trained in laparoscopic techniques and it involves a short operating time.\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of laparoscopic tubal ligation include the need for anesthesia and cost of laparoscopic equipment. The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia, which has its own risks. There is inherent risk with any surgery in which the peritoneal cavity is entered, including the rare risks of bowel injury, hemorrhage, transfusion, and, with some sterilization methods, thermal injury. All sterilization methods have risks of failure and regret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP)": "\nPre-Procedure\n\n\nBackground\nThe treatment of high-grade cervical dysplasia has traditionally been by cervical conization (also known as cone biopsy). Cervical conization is defined as the excision of a cone-shaped portion of the cervix surrounding the endocervical canal, which includes the entire transformation zone. Many methods are available to perform excisional treatment. These include using a scalpel (“cold-knife conization\"), laser, or electrosurgery (ie, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], also called large loop excision of the transformation zone [LLETZ]). In this article, the authors limit the discussion to LEEP.\n\n\nOne of the benefits of LEEP is that it provides the pathologist with an intact specimen in which to study an intraepithelial or superficially invasive lesion in its entirety. In certain situations, however, the entire lesion is not obtained by this method (pregnancy, extension of the lesion into the vaginal fornices, or high in the endocervical canal). In addition, LEEP excision procedures minimize blood loss by thermal cautery during excision but may cause thermal artifact that impairs the interpretability of a specimen.\nIndications\nIndications for LEEP excision are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsatisfactory colposcopy (the transformation zone is not fully visualized), especially if a high-grade lesion is suspected\n\n\n\n\nSuspected microinvasion\n\n\n\n\nLack of correlation between the cytology and colposcopy/biopsies, especially if a high grade lesion is suspected\n\n\n\n\nLesion extending into the endocervical canal\n\n\n\n\nEndocervical curettage showing CIN or glandular abnormality\n\n\n\n\nSuspected adenocarcinoma in situ (In this instance, cold-knife conization may be preferable as an increased risk of positive margins and higher recurrence risk with LEEP compared to cold-knife conization [CKC] may exist.\n [1] )\n\n\n\n\nColposcopist unable to rule out invasive disease\n\n\n\n\nRecurrence after an ablative or previous excisional procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nLEEP should not be performed during pregnancy unless a strong suspicion of cancer exists (as discussed below).\n\nPreparation\nAnesthesia\n\nIn most cases, LEEP excision is an office procedure performed under local anesthesia. Using a vasoconstricting solution with local anesthetic (listed below) is usually adequate. A 25-gauge to 27-gauge needle is used to inject the solution circumferentially 1 cm deep into the cervix outside the area to be excised. The cervix should blanch postinjection.\n\nEquipment\n\nEquipment includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrosurgical generator\n\n\n\nHigh frequency (350-1200 kHz)\n\nLow voltage (200-500 V)\n\n\n\n\n\nGrounding pad\n\n\n\n\nSmoke evacuation system\n\n\n\n\nInsulated vaginal speculum with smoke evacuation tubing\n\n\n\n\nVarious sizes of LEEP or Fischer cone biopsy excisor electrodes\n\n\n\n\n3-5 mm ball electrode\n\n\n\n\nSingle-tooth tenaculum\n\n\n\n\nMonsel’s solution\n\n\n\n\n3-5% acetic acid solution\n\n\n\n\nPitressin plus 1% lidocaine solution (10 units in 30 mL of 1% lidocaine) or 1% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:100,000 dilution)\n\n\n\n\n25-gauge to 27-gauge needle with 10-mL syringe\n\n\n\nPositioning\n\nThe patient is placed in dorsal lithotomy position, and the grounding pad is placed on the upper thigh.\n\nComplication prevention\nIn order to prevent complications and improve the quality of the specimen, 3 principles of electrosurgery should be kept in mind when performing the LEEP procedure. These include electrode size, current waveform, and speed of incision.\n\nElectrode size\n\nThinner wires provide greater concentration of the current. The higher power density gives a better cutting effect and decreased thermal spread.\n\nCurrent waveform\n\nThe depth of coagulation increases as the current is blended. A blended current mixes cutting and coagulating currents. At higher blends, more coagulating current exists and thus greater thermal damage.\n\nSpeed of incision\n\nThe faster the wire is passed through the cervical tissue, the cleaner the incision will be and with less thermal artifact in the specimen. The slower the passage of the wire, the more thermal damage will occur to the adjacent tissue. However, this results in better coagulation of the cone bed, but more tissue necrosis and postoperative scarring may occur.\n [2] \n\nIn addition to decrease the risk of cervical stenosis, removing the least amount of tissue possible is important. Incision depths of ≥ 1 cm increase the risk of cervical stenosis.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Normal Delivery of the Infant": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe delivery of a full-term newborn refers to delivery at a gestational age of 37-42 weeks, as determined by the last menstrual period or via ultrasonographic dating and evaluation. The Naegel rule is a commonly used formula to predict the due date based on the date of the last menstrual period. This rule assumes a menstrual cycle of 28 days and mid-cycle ovulation. Ultrasonographic dating can be more accurate, especially when it is performed early in pregnancy and is used to corroborate or modify a due date based on the last menstrual period.\nApproximately 11% of singleton pregnancies are delivered preterm and 10% of all deliveries are postterm. Thus, nearly 80% of newborns are delivered at full term, although only 3-5% of deliveries occur on the estimated due date.\n [1, 2] Over the past few decades, the number of patients who go into spontaneous labor has decreased, and the percentage of inductions (iatrogenic labor) has increased to 22% of all pregnancies.\n [3] \n\n\nLabor and delivery is divided into 3 stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first stage, the cervix dilates as a result of progressive rhythmic uterine contractions. This is typically the longest stage of labor. Cervical effacement, or thinning, occurs throughout the first stage of labor, and is graded 0-100%.\n\n\n\nThe first stage of labor is divided into the latent and active phases.\n\nThe latent phase can last for many hours. The cervix dilates, usually slowly, from closed to approximately 4-5 cm.\n\nThe active phase lasts from the end of the latent phase until delivery. It is characterized by rapid cervical dilation. The cervix usually dilates at a rate of 1.0 cm/h in nulliparous women and 1.2 cm/h in multiparous women during the active phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second stage of labor is the time between complete cervical dilation and delivery of the neonate. This phase lasts minutes to hours. The maximum accepted time for the second stage depends on the patient's parity and whether the patient has an epidural.\n\n\n\nSix cardinal movements of labor occur during the second stage of labor.\n\n\n\nEngagement of the head into the lower pelvis\n\nFlexion of the head, putting the occiput in presenting position\n\nDescent of the neonate through the pelvis\n\nInternal rotation of the vertex to maneuver past the lateral ischial spines\n\nExtension of the head to pass beneath the maternal symphysis\n\nExternal rotation of the head after delivery to facilitate shoulder delivery\n\n\nSeveral clinical parameters are followed.\n\n\n\nThe fetal presentation is determined by the first fetal body part that passes through the birth canal. Most commonly, this is the occiput or the vertex of the head.\n\nThe fetal station is the relation of the fetal head to the maternal ischial spines. The station is defined as -5 cm to +5 cm; 0 station is at the level of the ischial spines.\n\nThe fetal position is the orientation of the fetal vertex (the top of the head) in relation to the plane of the maternal ischial spines. The vertex normally rotates from a transverse position to an anterior or posterior position as the vertex internally rotates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe delivery of the placenta is the third and final stage of labor; it normally occurs within 30 minutes of delivery of the newborn. As the uterus contracts, a plane of separation develops at the placenta-endometrium interface. As the uterus further contracts, the placenta is expelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) released a committee opinion revising the definition of term pregnancy. The recommended change, as devised by a work group that included representatives from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, ACOG, SMFM, and other societies and organizations, replaces the designation “term” with the following\n [4] :\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly term: 37 weeks, 0 days, through 38 weeks, 6 days, of gestation\n\n\n\n\nFull term: 39 weeks, 0 days, through 40 weeks, 6 days, of gestation\n\n\n\n\nLate term: 41 weeks, 0 days, through 41 weeks, 6 days, of gestation\n\n\n\n\nPostterm: At least 42 weeks, 0 days, of gestation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Operative Hysteroscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nOperative hysteroscopy is a minimally invasive gynecological procedure in which an endoscopic optical lens is inserted through the cervix into the endometrial cavity to direct treatment of various types of intrauterine pathology. Historically, urologists used the resectoscope to perform a transurethral prostatectomy. This instrument was later modified to accommodate gynecological applications. Operative hysteroscopy became popular after improvements in endoscopic technology and instruments in the 1970s and after the introduction of fluid distension media in the 1980s.\n [1] Since that time, the development of new hysteroscopic instruments, fiber optics, and digital video equipment has continued to provide more varied, efficacious, and less invasive procedures. The introduction of smaller-diameter hysteroscopes has allowed operative hysteroscopy to become a predominately office and outpatient procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

It has been shown to be the best indicator of correct placement of the initial trocar (100% sensitive for preperitoneal insufflations).\n\nIn obese patients or patients with suspected pelvic adhesions, we routinely choose the left upper quadrant site and use the direct entry technique using a 5-mm optical trocar and 5-mm 0-degree scope. We find that the close proximity of this site to the lower rib requires less force to lift the anterior abdominal wall as compared to the umbilical site. This is especially practical in obese patients and can be performed by the surgeon alone without assistance.\n\nAlways make sure that a nasogastric or orogastric tube is placed and the stomach is deflated prior to performing a left upper quadrant entry.\n\nComplication Prevention\n\nPreperitoneal insufflation can occur when the Veress needle is mistakenly placed in the preperitoneal space and insufflations are started. This can prevent entry inside the peritoneal cavity and can create a false space with potential injury to the underlying vascular structures. It is one cause of conversion to laparotomy.\n [4] \n\nOmental emphysema can occur when the Veress needle is inserted into the omentum and appears as gas bubbles within the omentum. It is rarely of clinical consequence. Elevation of CO2 levels has been reported.\n [5] \n\nMost wound infections are superficial and consists of wound cellulitis. However, more serious infections and wound abscesses rarely occur, especially in the context of a contaminated surgery like pelvic abscesses, ruptured appendix, or bowel injury. Most of these infections are treated conservatively with bedside drainage, wound packing, and antibiotics. Severe necrotizing fasciitis can rarely occur.\n [4] The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy.\n [5] \n\nBowel injury can occur during closed-entry or open-entry technique. However, the incidence seems to be the lowest during open entry (0.048%) versus closed entry (0.083%).\n [6] The risk of bowel injury increases in the context of bowel adhesions, such as a history of previous surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, and endometriosis. Bowel injury is concerning because these injury can be missed during the surgery and present postoperatively with peritonitis and sepsis.\n\nInjury to a major retroperitoneal vessel is a catastrophic complication and occurs most commonly during laparoscopic entry when blindly placing the Veress needle or primary trocar through a periumbilical incision.\n [7, 8] However, vascular injury can occur regardless of the method of entry because of the short distance between the base of the umbilicus and the major retroperitoneal vessels, which can be as little as 2 cm.\n [9] The incidence of major vascular injury ranges between 0.04 and 0.5%.\n [10, 11] \n\nAccidental placement of the Veress needle and insufflating into a major vein can result in a massive gas embolism. Injuring any of the major vessels can result in fatal exsanguination.\n\nInjury to the deep inferior epigastric vessels can cause subcutaneous hematoma and significant morbidity.\n [10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Ovarian Cystectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe normal ovary by nature is a partially cystic structure. Most ovarian cysts develop as consequence of disordered ovulation in which the follicle fails to release the oocyte. The follicular cells continue to secrete fluid and expand the follicle, which over time can become cystic.\nThe ovaries are the female pelvic reproductive organs that house the ova and are also responsible for the production of sex hormones. They are paired organs located on either side of the uterus within the broad ligament below the uterine (fallopian) tubes. The ovary is within the ovarian fossa, a space that is bound by the external iliac vessels, obliterated umbilical artery, and the ureter. The ovaries are responsible for housing and releasing ova, or eggs, necessary for reproduction. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ovary Anatomy.\n\n\nIndeed, ovarian cysts were the fourth most common gynecologic cause of hospital admissions according to a late 1980s study by Grimes and Hughes.\n [1] Most cysts spontaneously resolve while some will persist. The persistent ovarian cysts are most likely to be surgically managed. The standard surgical approach to presumptively benign ovarian cysts is the laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. Indeed, it is one of the most common procedures performed by the practicing obstetrician gynecologist.\nIn this article, the pathophysiology of ovarian cysts is briefly reviewed to provide a foundation for understanding the ovary and benign cyst formation. The remainder of the article concentrates on the patient evaluation and surgical approaches to cyst removal.\n\n\n\n\nPathophysiology of ovarian cyst formation\nObstetrician-gynecologists and surgeons most commonly encounter 3 types of benign ovarian cysts. They include functional (follicular and corpus luteum) cysts, mature cystic teratomas, and endometriomas. Functional cysts form in reproductive-aged females during folliculogenesis and are either follicular or corpus luteal in origin.\n\n\n\n\nThe cysts occur during the process of normal female reproductive physiology, hence their functional designation. The pathogenesis of follicular cyst formation is complex and is associated with the release of anterior pituitary hormones. In these cases, the traditional feedback mechanisms are not synchronized and the luteinizing hormone surge is muted.\n [2] \n\nConsequently, the oocyte is not released by the follicle, which in turn fails to involute and continues to grow, sometimes achieving cystic proportions. Corpus luteum cysts develop after ovulation through an unknown mechanism. They can become quite large and torsed and, thus, are more likely to be associated with pain and in some cases delayed menses. Some cysts autonomously function such as those associated with the McCune-Albright syndrome and can achieve large sizes.\n\nMature cystic teratomas (MCTs) or dermoids are actually benign germ cell tumors that are partially cystic. They can occur over a broad range of ages, yet more than 70% occur during the reproductive years.\n [3] They are thought to develop from a single primordial germ cell that has completed meiosis I and is meiosis II-suppressed.\n [4] This theory is supported by the anatomic distribution of teratomas throughout the migration pathway of primordial germ cells from the yolk sac to the gonadal ridges.\n [5] MCTs are composed of all 3 germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. They are usually unilateral, measure 2-4 cm in diameter, and are filled with thick sebaceous material, hair, calcifications and sometimes teeth (see images below).\n [6] Some are even hormonally active.\n [7] \n\nUnlike simple cysts, MCTs do not resolve spontaneously. Most require surgical intervention. They are more likely than other benign cysts to be associated with ovarian torsion. Although dermoid cysts are benign, complications from their rupture include chemical peritonitis, bowel adhesions and obstruction, and abscesses.\n [8] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMature cystic teratoma of the ovary exhibiting multiple tissue types. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMature cystic teratoma of the ovary with hair, sebaceous material, and thyroid tissue. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nEndometriomas are hormonally active ovarian cysts with the hormone changes corresponding to menstrual cycle phases. The origin of endometriomas has been controversial. Nezhat and coworkers have suggested that 2 types of endometriomas exist: primary and secondary.\n [9] According to the authors, primary endometriomas originate as invaginated surface endometrial glands. They develop slowly over time and rarely achieve sizes greater than 5-6 cm. They are quite difficult to remove from their fibrotic capsule at the time of cystectomies. Upon microscopic examination, both endometrial glands and stroma are identified. Secondary endometriomas originate in functional cysts, with some having their origins in a corpus luteum. These endometriomas are the classic chocolate cysts and contain dark blood (see image below). Secondary endometriomas can achieve quite large sizes and can be removed easily. Microscopic examination of a well-sampled specimen often reveals a corpus luteum, endometrial glands, and stroma.\n [9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndometriosis.

        "Pelvic Exenteration": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction to pelvic exenteration\nPelvic exenteration is a salvage procedure performed for centrally recurrent gynecologic cancers. To a greater or lesser degree, the procedure involves en bloc resection of all pelvic structures, including the uterus, cervix, vagina, bladder, and rectum. Most candidates for this procedure have a diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer that has previously been treated with surgery and radiation or radiation alone. In some cases, patients with recurrent uterine, vulvar, or vaginal cancers may benefit from pelvic exenteration.\n [1, 2] In general, patients with ovarian cancer are not candidates because of the distant pattern of spread associated with ovarian cancers.\n\n\nPelvic exenteration was first reported by Brunschwig in 1948 as an especially radical surgical treatment for advanced and recurrent cervical cancer. It was described as \"the most radical surgical attack so far described for pelvic cancer\" and at the time had an operative mortality rate of 23%.\n [3] Since Brunschwig's time, improvements in critical care, antibiotics, hyperalimentation, and thromboembolism prophylaxis, accompanied by similar advances in surgical technique, including the use of stapling devices, separate urinary conduits, and pelvic reconstruction, have improved the morbidity and mortality rates associated with the procedure. Currently, operative mortality rates are 3-5%, the major perioperative complication rate is 30-44%, and the overall 5-year survival rate in patients who successfully undergo the procedure is 20-50%.\n [4, 5, 6, 7] \nPelvic exenteration continues to be the only curative option in certain patients with centrally recurrent cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancers. Although patients with other gynecologic malignancies generally are not candidates for exenterative procedures, some centers have reported exenterations in select cases of central pelvic recurrences, such as low-grade uterine sarcomas.\n\n\n\n\nGo to Ovarian Cancer and Borderline Ovarian Cancer for complete information on these topics.\n\n\n\n\nProcedures preceding recurrence\nPatients with recurrent cervical cancer after primary treatment with surgery and radiation or radiation alone are faced with few options, because chemotherapy is at best palliative, and the 1- and 5-year survival rates are, respectively, 15% and less than 5%.\n [1, 2] \n\nCancers arising in the pelvis are often treated with multimodality therapies, including surgical resection and radiation. When these cancers recur, many may be locally advanced but still limited to the pelvis; however, previous treatment with high doses of radiation makes limited surgical resection a difficult undertaking fraught with complications. Furthermore, the response of tumors to chemotherapy within a previously radiated field is extremely poor. In some instances, the only opportunity for cure may lie in complete resection.\n\nClinical presentation and confirmation of recurrence\nPatients with recurrent cervical cancer after radiation therapy usually present with bleeding, hematuria, or pelvic pain.\n [8] In some cases, the first sign of recurrence is the discovery of hydronephrosis or abnormal cytology on routine follow-up. Before proceeding with the surgical procedure, confirming a recurrence with a pathologic specimen obtained by biopsy is essential. In patients who have previously had high doses of pelvic radiation, physical examination is notoriously unreliable, and bleeding and pain may be related to radiation changes rather than recurrent disease.\n\nApproach to treatment\nThe first steps in the approach to treating a patient with a biopsy-proven central recurrence are an exhaustive search for distant metastatic disease and evaluation for comorbid conditions. The initial surgical exploration involves a further search for disseminated disease and necessitates a complete assessment of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal areas that would preclude proceeding with exenteration.\n [9] This task can be accomplished by laparoscopy in selected patients.\n [10] \n\nChemotherapy and other controversies\nChemotherapy in patients with recurrent cervical cancer is an option for patients with distant metastatic disease and for those who are not candidates for pelvic exenteration. Several regimens have been evaluated, and response rates of 5-40% are described. A Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) phase III study of cisplatin versus cisplatin and topotecan in patients with advanced (stage IVB), recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer reported a survival advantage in the combination arm (9.4 vs 6.5 mo).\n [11] However, most responses to chemotherapy are at best partial and of short duration; therefore, chemotherapy is generally a poor alternative to surgery in patients with recurrent disease who are candidates for a surgical approach.\n [12] Controversy continues regarding the appropriate selection of patients for exenteration and the use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), pre-exenteration chemotherapy,\n [13] concomitant continent urinary diversion, and low rectal anastomosis.\n\nIndications for pelvic exenteration\nPelvic exenteration is primarily indicated for centrally recurrent cervical cancers in patients who have received definitive radiation therapy. The procedure is appropriate in patients who meet criteria for any recurrent pelvic tumor if a chance of cure exists with the procedure. On occasion, pelvic exenteration can be performed as a palliative procedure for control of local disease causing severe fistulas or other unmanageable symptoms.\n [14] \n\nContraindications to pelvic exenteration\nAbsolute contraindications for pelvic exenteration include peritoneal metastasis, skip metastasis to the bowel, and metastases at other distant sites, such as pulmonary metastases. Relative contraindications include metastasis to retroperitoneal nodes, direct tumor invasion of adherent bowel loops, and hydroureter or hydronephrosis. Determination of the extent of resection is based on sidewall involvement, infralevator versus supralevator, and anterior versus posterior versus total exenteration.\n\nThe clinical triad of leg edema, ureteral obstruction, and leg pain is almost pathognomonic for disease extending to the pelvic sidewall and, historically, has generally been considered a contraindication to surgery. However, some surgeons have reported on an even more radical resection, the laterally extended endopelvic resection (LEER), which extends the lateral extent of the resection to include structures of the pelvic sidewall, including striated muscle and vessels.\n [15] Further study is required to evaluate the indications and outcomes of these procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Perimortem Cesarean Delivery": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nCesarean delivery is one of the oldest surgical procedures in history, with literature dating back to at least 800 BCE.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] Before the 20th century, however, the procedure was never undertaken unless the mother was dead or moribund.\n [2] \n\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, case reports began to arise of perimortem cesarean delivery (PMCD) successfully salvaging the fetus, and the procedure began to be seriously considered as a legitimate medical intervention. Well into the 20th century, the salvage rate was very low, and therefore, authors on the subject advocated it only after all other resuscitative measures had failed.\nSee the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCesarean delivery rates, United States. \n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 1980s, several authors reported unexpected maternal recoveries after postmortem cesarean deliveries.\n [5, 6] This led to the possibility that PMCD might actually improve, rather than worsen, a mother’s chance of survival during a collapse.\n\nBecause current pregnancy-related death rates are, fortunately, very low,\n [7] PMCD is rarely required at present. Although this procedure has traditionally been performed during resuscitative efforts in the emergency department (ED),\n [8]  cases of PMCD in the prehospital setting have been reported.\n [9, 10] \n\nBefore 1986, only 188 PMCDs had been reported; a case review of the data reported between 1986 and 2004 revealed only 38 additional case reports.\n [11] A review of these 38 case reports revealed that the most common causes of maternal arrest included trauma, pulmonary embolism, cardiac causes, sepsis, and eclampsia.\n [11] Despite the paucity of data, PMCD infant survival rates as high as 70% have been reported; more recently, successful maternal resuscitations related to expedited delivery of the infant have been reported.\n [12] Other etiologic factors were noted in a recent case series, as 4 of 5 cases of PMCD involved obese women older than 35 years.\n [13] \n\nDespite the rarity of PMCD, it is worthy of attention because, when appropriately applied, it can save the life of both the mother and the infant. Furthermore, more recent literature suggests that the role for PMCD may be broader than previously envisioned, and the procedure may attain a more prominent role in the future.\n\nGo to Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Delivery and Cesarean Delivery for complete information on these topics.\n\nIndications\nCurrently, maternal diseases are vastly different in the industrialized world from what they were a century ago. A 1986 review highlighted the shift over the past century from primarily chronic, mostly infectious causes of death to primarily acute, mostly cardiorespiratory causes of death.\n [4] \n\nThis shift is vitally important for outcome. A chronically ill mother may be inadequately nourishing her unborn child for months, thus making a good outcome of any delivery less likely. However, an acute event, such as pulmonary embolus, leaves the infant with some reserves and allows a less-than-optimal delivery setting to produce a good outcome.\n\nIn addition, the ability to monitor high-risk patients and intervene in the event of a crisis has greatly expanded over the past 50 years. The advent of advanced emergency transportation systems, advanced life support protocols, and intensive cardiorespiratory support units allows much better outcomes after prolonged anoxia than might have been possible before these advances.\n\nSeveral factors must be considered in deciding whether to undertake PMCD.\n [14, 15, 16, 2, 4, 5, 17, 18, 19] The first is the estimated gestational age (EGA) of the fetus. This information is sometimes difficult to obtain in an emergency situation, and allowing time to perform an ultrasonographic estimate is not practical. Thus, a gross visual estimate may be necessary.\n\nAs a general rule, the uterus reaches the umbilicus at 20 weeks of gestational age and grows at a rate of approximately 1 cm in length for every week thereafter. Thus, in a relatively thin woman, a fundal height of 8 cm above the umbilicus would likely represent a pregnancy of 28 weeks’ gestation.\n\nThe resources of the institution should also be considered in the decision regarding PMCD. Under ideal circumstances (ie, with the availability of all skilled personnel and in a controlled setting), fetal salvageability may range from 23 to 28 weeks of EGA. If the EGA is 23 weeks and the institution’s nursery has never had a newborn of this EGA survive, PMCD is probably not indicated for the sake of the fetus.\n\nPMCD also may not benefit the mother, compared with a third-trimester intervention, because the cardiovascular effects of pregnancy are less pronounced before 28 weeks, and delivery therefore will not achieve dramatic maternal cardiovascular improvement. Before 23 weeks of gestational age, aggressive maternal support is the only indicated intervention, and at least 1 case of complete maternal and fetal recovery after a prolonged arrest at 15 weeks of EGA has been reported.\n [20] \n\nAnother concern relates to the length of time between arrest and delivery. Although the rare nature of the condition makes evidence somewhat sketchy at best, early intervention is strongly supported in the course of a cardiopulmonary arrest at advanced gestational age.\n\nThe latest reported survival was of an infant delivered 30 minutes after a maternal suicide,\n [21] but the best outcomes in terms of infant neurologic status appear to occur if the infant is delivered within 5 minutes of maternal cardiac arrest. This means the decision to operate must be made and surgery begun by 4 minutes into the arrest.\n\nThe same authors that proposed this timeframe reviewed the literature again in 2005 and reported 7 infant survivals in deliveries occurring more than 15 minutes after maternal cardiac arrest.\n [11] These findings suggest that considering PMCD is prudent, even if there has been some delay after a diagnosed cardiac arrest. Notably, the authors again confirmed that maternal status did not worsen in any case in which a PMCD was undertaken and seemed to improve in 13 of 20 cases published. In addition, a recent case series notes that of the 4 survivors (out of 5), 3 cases had PMCD initiated 6-14 minutes after maternal arrest, and initial follow-up was encouraging in all 4 infants.\n [13]  \n\nA study by Rose et al reinforced the concept that arrangements for delivery should be made at the same time with initiation of maternal resuscitative efforts if the uterus is palpable at or above the umbilicus. The authors also added that if maternal condition is not rapidly reversible, hysterotomy with delivery should be performed regardless of fetal viability or elapsed time since arrest.\n [22] \n\nAnother factor to be considered is the adequacy of other resuscitative efforts in the interim. Adequate chest compressions and displacement of the gravid uterus off the venous return from the lower extremities are both proven to improve maternal oxygenation. The fetus lives on the steep portion of the oxygen dissociation curve; therefore, relatively minor maternal changes may result in dramatic changes for the fetus. Resuscitative efforts also must include postcesarean infant resuscitation.\n\nDocumenting fetal heart tones before PMCD is not required, partly because it is time consuming and may negatively impact the baby’s outcome and partly because maternal indications for the procedure are emergency concerns regardless of fetal status.\n\nA special case of PMCD is the scheduled PMCD. This involves a woman who is deemed brain dead but is maintained on artificial support for the purpose of allowing fetal maturity. Successful cases of scheduled PMCD have been reported from EGAs as early as 6 weeks,\n [23] but an ethics issue arises regarding extraordinary support measures for the sole purpose of providing a fetal incubator. Full informed consent from the next of kin is mandatory.\n [24] \n\nThe most likely timeframe for both successful support and acceptance of the value of support is at 24-27 weeks of EGA,\n [25] when a few days make a large difference to fetal outcome. Support beyond likely fetal survival is controversial.\n [26] Dillon and colleagues make a strong distinction between true brain death and persistent vegetative state, arguing that termination of support measures is ethically defensible only in the former case.\n [25] \n\nYet another factor that may affect decision making is potential medicolegal considerations. Fear of litigation may prevent intervention in what would be, by all medical judgment, appropriate circumstances for a PMCD. It should be kept in mind, however, that no lawsuits filed on the basis of wrongful performance of PMCD have been reported in the literature.\n [27] Only 1 legal penalty has been levied in regard to PMCD—the death penalty, which was given in the 18th century for failure to perform the procedure.\n\nGenerally, PMCD is deemed an emergency procedure for which consent is not possible. When maternal consent is not an issue, no other opinion should be deemed as legally binding in the emergency setting. Clearly, when the situation involves a ventilator-dependent, brain-dead patient being kept alive solely as a nursery, next-of-kin decisions become relevant, and legal and, possibly, spiritual, counsel should be sought.\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to PMCD include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown gestation less than 24 weeks\n\n\n\n\nReturn of spontaneous circulation after brief period of resuscitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Postpartum Tubal Sterilization": "\nOverview\n\n\nProcedure background\nPostpartum tubal sterilization is an effective permanent contraceptive option for women whether it is performed by partial salpingectomy, electrocoagulation, or the use of rings or clips.\n [1] This procedure can be performed at the time of cesarean delivery or shortly after a vaginal delivery. It should not prolong a patient’s hospital stay. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the immediate postpartum period may be the optimal time to perform sterilization because of technical ease for the physician and convenience for the patient.\n [2] Some background information is provided below.\n\n\nTubal sterilization remains the most common contraceptive method for women older than age 35 years, although oral contraceptive use superseded tubal sterilization as the leading method of contraception in the United States in 2002. Overall, nearly 19% of US women aged 15-49 years rely on female sterilization for contraception.\n [2] \nThe number of tubal sterilization procedures performed in the United States has remained relatively stable since the early 1980s at approximately 650,000 procedures annually. About 50% of these are performed in the postpartum setting following 8-9% of all live births.\n [3]  In a 2015 report, data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey between 2000-2008 noted that postpartum tubal sterilizations after cesarean sections were more common in those with Medicaid coverage and in black women, older women, and nonsingle women.\n [4] In addition, the South, small hospitals, and proprietary and government hospitals had a higher proportion of postpartum tubal sterilizations after cesarean section.\n [4]  A retrospective cohort study that included data from 10,741 tubal sterilization procedures reported an increase in salpingectomies performed from 0.4% to 35.5% from 2011-2016.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nWorldwide and in the United States, the most common surgical approach for postpartum tubal sterilization is by infraumbilical minilaparotomy. With the fundus at the level of the umbilicus immediately postpartum, the fallopian tubes are usually easily accessed from this entry point. Bilateral tubal ligation may also be performed after hysterotomy closure at the time of cesarean, but this article will focus on the postpartum approach within 48 hours following a vaginal delivery.\n\n\n\n\nIndications and contraindications\nPostpartum tubal sterilization is indicated in any patient who is medically stable after a vaginal delivery (usually within 48 hours) and desires permanent contraception. The patient should have been properly counseled about the procedure (see Patient Education and Informed Consent). Consideration must also be given to regulations regarding timing of consent\n [6] and adequacy of staff to perform an elective procedure.\n\nContraindications to postpartum tubal sterilization include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an unstable medical condition postpartum (eg, hemorrhage, infection, uncontrolled hypertension, HELLP [hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets] syndrome)\n\n\n\n\nThe patient is ambivalent regarding the procedure\n\n\n\n\nThe patient has known or suspected significant abnormalities of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or intra-abdominal cavity\n\n\n\n\nThe patient consent is not mature according to state/local regulations\n\n\n\n\nThe status of the newborn is unclear\n\n\n\nTechnical considerations\nProcedure planning and complication prevention are briefly discussed below.\n\nProcedure planning\nIt is critical to correctly identify the fallopian tube before ligation or clip application.\n\nIn situations in which visualization is difficult, Trendelenburg and lateral tilt positions may help as well as the use of small laparotomy sponges.\n\nWhen performing a postpartum modified Pomeroy tubal ligation, holding one suture long before excision of the tubal portion prevents retraction of the tube back into the abdomen before hemostasis can be assessed and the tubal ostia visualized.\n\nThe Filshie clip system is an alternative to partial salpingectomy in the postpartum setting, particularly useful in difficult surgical cases (eg, obesity, intra-abdominal adhesions).\n [7, 8] A randomized controlled trial published in 2012 showed, however, that the titanium clip was not as effective as partial salpingectomy in the postpartum setting.\n [9] Through 2 years of observation, the pregnancy probability for the clip group was 0.017 compared with 0.004 for the partial salpingectomy group (P = 0.04). However, this study was limited by a high loss–to–follow-up rate (just over 50% for both groups) and a limited follow-up period (24 mo).\n [9] Increased edema and hypertrophy of the fallopian tubes in pregnancy are thought to be responsible for this difference in effectiveness.\n\nComplication prevention\nComplications of minilaparotomy are typically minor, including wound infection and incisional hernia formation. To avoid the minor wound infection that may occur following surgery, a thorough preoperative skin preparation with an antiseptic solution must be performed. There is no indication for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for the procedure.\n\nTo decrease the risks associated with difficulty in locating abdominopelvic structures, the surgeon must assess the level of the fundus before the start of the procedure to ensure the adnexa is adequately accessible.\n\nFailure rates at 12 months poststerilization and major morbidity are rare.\n [1] A common reason for sterilization failure is ligation of the wrong structure, typically the round ligament. Therefore, careful identification and isolation of the fallopian tube before ligation is necessary. Furthermore, if a tubal segment is excised, pathologic confirmation is an important step, when available.\n\nPoststerilization regret is very age-dependent, with 20% of women aged 30 years or younger regretting their decision, whereas only 6% of those older than 30 years express regret.\n [10] Any ambivalence displayed by a patient in the peripartum period should be considered an indication to delay the sterilization procedure. However, a retrospective study by Thurman and Janecek reported that women who requested postpartum tubal sterilization but did not receive it were more likely to become pregnant again within 1 year than women who did not request sterilization.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Radical and Simple Trachelectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nCervical cancer is the second most common malignancy in women worldwide.\n [1] According to Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data from 2013-2017, the age-adjusted incidence of cervical cancer was 7.4 per 100,000 women per year.\n [2] The standard treatment of cervical cancer worldwide includes surgery, chemoradiotherapy, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. However, in young women with early cervical cancer who want to preserve fertility, alternative surgical options such as radical trachelectomy (RT) or simple trachelectomy are available in select cases.\nAppropriate patient selection is crucial for successful fertility-sparing surgery. Radical trachelectomy can be approached vaginally, abdominally, laparoscopically, or robotically. Radical trachelectomy is a curative conservative procedure in which the cervix, upper 1-2 cm of the vagina, parametria (tissue adjacent to the cervix), and paracolpos are resected while preserving the uterine corpus and fundus.\n [3] \n\n\nIn 1994, Dargent et al reported the first laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by radical vaginal trachelectomy. Since this initial report, over 1000 women have undergone this procedure, with over 250 successful pregnancies afterward.\n [4] \nThe morbidity is considered low, with a tumor recurrence rate between 4.2% and 5.3% and a mortality rate between 2.5% and 3.2%.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nParametrial resection in early cervical cancer has been controversial. Schmeler et al performed an extensive literature search of conservative surgery in women with low-risk early cervical cancer (stage 1A2-1B1, < 2 cm, no lymph-vascular space invasion) from 1970-2010 and found that several studies reported parametrial involvement in less than 1% of patients.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nMore recent studies have explored a more conservative approach with less-radical surgery, including pelvic lymphadenectomy with cone biopsy, simple trachelectomy, or simple hysterectomy.\n [5] Unlike radical hysterectomy (RH) or radical trachelectomy, simple trachelectomy involves the removal of the cervix and not the parametria.\n\nRob et al evaluated 26 patients with stage 1A2-1B1 cervical cancer who underwent lymph node evaluation through laparoscopic sentinel lymph node identification, frozen section, and complete pelvic lymphadenectomy. Four patients had positive lymph nodes and underwent a type 3 radical hysterectomy, whereas 22 patients had negative lymph nodes and underwent either a cone excision or simple trachelectomy. Only 1 of 26 patients developed central recurrence 14 months after the procedure, and the patient was successfully treated with chemoradiation.\n\nOf the 15 women who wanted to conceive, 11 became pregnant, with 1 delivery at 24 weeks, 1 at 34 weeks, 1 at 36 weeks, 5 at term, and the remaining resulting in elective abortion, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy.\n [6] Further studies are warranted to evaluate the safety of less-radical surgery in a larger group of patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Rectocele Repair": "\nBackground\n\n\nAs women age, the prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction increases, including pelvic organ prolapse. A woman’s lifetime risk of having surgery for pelvic organ prolapse is 13%.\n [1]  The United States population is getting older. Based on data from the United States Census Bureau in 2009, women older than 65 years account for 14% of the population.\n [2]  This percentage is suspected to double in the next 25 years.\n [3] With this increase, there will be an increasing demand for prolapse repair, including rectocele repairs.\nUp to one third to one half of women undergoing surgery for prolapse will have procedures that involve the posterior vaginal wall.\n [4, 5] Rectoceles are one type of posterior compartment prolapse that consists of the rectum protruding into the vagina. Other conditions that impact the posterior wall include enteroceles, sigmoidoceles, intussusception, and rectal prolapse. Posterior vaginal wall prolapse can manifest as an asymptomatic bulge or with bothersome symptoms such as constipation, pelvic pressure, and defecatory dysfunction, including obstructed defecation. The gynecologist must keep in mind that surgical treatment should be reserved for symptomatic patients only.\n\n\nNonsurgical options for management of rectocele include expectant management, treatment of constipation, pelvic floor muscle training, and treatment with a pessary. In a study of patients with both rectoceles and obstructed defecation, 70% of patients improved. Further information on nonsurgical management can be found in the Medscape section on Rectocele: Treatment & Management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Robotic Surgery in Benign Gynecologic Indications": "\nBackground\n\n\nGynecologic surgery has undergone a significant evolution over the past few centuries.\nThe first planned hysterectomy was a vaginal hysterectomy performed by Osiander of Gottingen in Lower Saxony in Germany in 1801.\n [1] Since then, the techniques of gynecologic surgery have been significantly enhanced and the complications reduced.\n\n\nLaparoscopy was introduced in gynecology in the 1940s. It was not until 1988 that the first laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy was performed by Harry Reich in Pennsylvania.\n [1] Many criticized this procedure because of the complexity of the technique, along with the lengthy operating time. Eventually, technology evolved, and the laparoscopic approach led to decreased hospital length of stay and faster postoperative recovery with minimal differences in postoperative morbidity or mortality. \nRobotic surgery in gynecologic procedures began when the da Vinci surgical system was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the first gynecologic surgery was performed in 2005. Since then, the number of minimally invasive gynecologic procedures has increased dramatically, with the number of robotically assisted hysterectomies surpassing the number of hysterectomies performed with conventional laparoscopy.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nSince the inception of a robot by Leonardo da Vinci in 1495, the field of robotics has expanded into many areas, including the automobile industry, space exploration, military, and medicine. The evolution of robotic systems in surgery began in 1985 with the use of a robotic arm called the PUMA 560 for a stereotactic brain biopsy. Different models based on inputting preoperative designs for surgery into the robotic device were then developed and applied in the fields of general surgery for transurethral resection of the prostate (PROBOT) and orthopedics for hip replacements (ROBODOC).\n [3] Robotic telepresence technology was then conceived to provide immediate operative care remotely to wounded soldiers on the battlefield.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1994, AESOP was the first FDA-approved surgical robot, which consisted of a voice-activated system and robotic arm for endoscopic camera control to replace a surgical assistant in laparoscopy. HERMES was then developed to give the surgeon voice-activated control over the camera, light source, insufflation, printer, phone, operating room lights, and the patient table position. Two robotic arms and a surgeon console were implemented in the ZEUS surgical system that was used in 1999 for cardiac surgery and then FDA approved for laparoscopic surgery in 2001. In 2005, the FDA approved the current robotic platform, the da Vinci surgical system. The advancements of the previous devices were incorporated into this system, along with many others.\n\n2020 ACOG guidelines on robot-assisted gynecologic surgery\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released guidelines on robot-assisted gynecologic surgery that include the following\n [4] :\n\n\n\n\n\nRobot-assisted cases should be appropriately selected based on the available data and expert opinion. In addition to the didactic and hands-on training necessary for any new technology, ongoing quality assurance is essential to ensure appropriate use of the technology and, most importantly, patient safety.\n\n\n\n\nAdoption of new surgical techniques should be driven by what is best for the patient, as determined by evidence-based medicine rather than external pressures.\n\n\n\n\nAdequate informed consent should be obtained from patients before surgery. In the case of robotic procedures, this includes a discussion of the indications for surgery and risks and benefits associated with the robotic technique compared with alternative approaches and other therapeutic options.\n\n\n\n\nSurgeons should describe their experience with robotic-assisted surgery or any new technology when counseling patients regarding these procedures.\n\n\n\n\nSurgeons should be skilled at abdominal and laparoscopic approaches for a specific procedure before undertaking robotic approaches.\n\n\n\n\nSurgeon training, competency guidelines, and quality metrics should be developed at the institutional level.\n\n\n\n\nReporting of adverse events is currently voluntary and unstandardized, and the true rate of complications is not known.

Prolapse of these components of the wall can trigger subsequent prolapse of the cervix and/or uterus—or the vaginal cuff following hysterectomy. Similar to abdominal hernias, pelvic organ prolapse can be considered a herniation of either pelvic or abdominal contents through a structural weakness in the pelvic floor.\n\nSymptoms of pelvic organ prolapse have been defined in a joint report from the International Urogynecological Association and International Continence Society as “a departure from normal sensation, structure, or function, experienced by the woman in reference to the position of her pelvic organs.”\n [3] \n\nThe Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) system and the Baden-Walker system are two systems that can be used to evaluate the degree of prolapse. DeLancey has graded these protrusions according to abnormalities in three different levels of anatomic support,\n [4] whereas the POPQ is an objective and ordinal classification system.\n [5] Prolapses are named based on the organ that has descended; for example, a defect in which the urinary bladder has herniated through the anterior vaginal wall is a cystocele. Uterovaginal prolapse and vaginal cuff prolapse are apical defects. Enteroceles are a hybrid of anterior and posterior defects, and refer to herniation of the intestines into the apical wall.\n\nStaging\n\nThe International Urogynecological Association and International Continence Society have adopted a standardization of terminology for the evaluation and description of prolapse in the POPQ.\n [3, 6]  The hymen remnant is the fixed reference point in this system. Although the method of measurement and defined stages of prolapse remain under debate, the original description by Bump et al defines six points to compare in relation to the hymen, as shown in the image below.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix sites (Aa, Ba, C, D, Bp and Ap), genital hiatus (gh), perineal body (pb), and total vaginal length (tvl) used for pelvic organ support quantification. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe degree of prolapse is then stratified into an ordinal staging system\n [3] :\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 0: No prolapse\n\n\n\n\nStage I: Most distal point is greater than 1 cm proximal to the hymen\n\n\n\n\nStage II: Most distal point is between 1 cm proximal to the hymen and 1 cm distal to the hymen\n\n\n\n\nStage II: Most distal point is greater than 1 cm distal to the hymen\n\n\n\n\nStage IV: Complete eversion of the length of the lower genital tract\n\n\n\nThe image below shows the POPQ staging system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProlapse staging according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification staging system. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nSuch a classification system allows a standard method of exchanging information between physicians and allows better comparison of research data. Review of this system has shown good interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility.\n [5] \n\nEtiology\n\nMultiple factors contribute to the etiology of fascial or ligament weakness that ultimately result in pelvic organ prolapse. They can be related to or involve some combination of comorbidities, genetic, and environmental influences. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing age\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing body mass index (obesity)\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing gravidity\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing parity\n\n\n\n\nNumber of vaginal deliveries\n\n\n\n\nMacrosomic delivery\n\n\n\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\n\n\n\nConstipation\n\n\n\n\nStrenuous activity, weight bearing, or strenuous labor\n\n\n\nSwift et al examined a cohort of 497 women older than 18 years who presented for routine gynecology evaluation in an outpatient setting.\n [7] Investigators identified a positive association between prolapse trend and parity, number of vaginal deliveries, and more specifically, number of vaginal deliveries of macrosomic infants. There was also a higher incidence of prolapse in postmenopausal women. A multicenter study consisting of 1004 women identified the following risk factors on univariate analysis: increasing age, body mass index (BMI), gravidity, parity, number of vaginal deliveries, and weight of the vaginally delivered infant.\n [8] Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that only increasing age, Hispanic race, increasing BMI, and higher weight of the infant delivered vaginally were risk factors for prolapse.\n [8] \n\nNygaard et al studied participants of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Hormone Replacement Therapy trial and found that risk factors for prolapse differed based on the grade of the prolapse itself. For patients with stage II prolapse and above, education level, number of vaginal deliveries, and infant birth weight were risk factors that distinguished affected patients from those at earlier stages.\n [9] \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), constipation, and a history of strenuous exercise or manual labor have also been associated with pelvic organ prolapse.\n [10, 11, 12] Though prior studies have identified race as having a potential connection with prolapse, the correlation has appeared to vary based on the selection bias. Further studies are needed to clarify the association.\n\nSurgical treatment\n\nSacrocolpopexy is a surgical technique used in cases of pelvic organ prolapse—in particular, apical and vaginal vault prolapses in females. Reconstruction involves attaching the apical portion of the vagina—or for women who have undergone hysterectomy, the vaginal cuff—to the sacral promontory. The procedure is meant to mimic the suspension normally provided by the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments, and can be attained with open technique or with laparoscopic or robotic surgery. Patients who also present with uterine prolapse can undergo hysterectomy at the time of reconstruction, or choose from a number of uterine-sparing options.\n\nPreoperative assessment is paramount to the success of the reconstruction, as the type of surgery is predicated on the type and grade of organ prolapse, in addition to presenting symptoms. For instance, there may be concomitant herniation of other aspects of the vaginal wall also requiring repair. These patients may be better served with a transvaginal approach.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nPelvic organ prolapse has a prevalence of 31-41% among menopausal women, according to large multicenter observational studies.\n [10, 13]  One such study examined women at an outpatient gynecology clinic and reported the following distribution according to the POPQ assessment: 24% stage 0, 38% stage I, 35% stage II, 2% stage III, and 0% stage IV.\n [8] \n\nNygaard et al studied a smaller population that was a subset of those enrolled in the WHI Hormone Replacement Therapy trial. They found 2.3% with stage 0 prolapse, 33% with stage I, 62.9% with stage II, 1.9% with stage III, and 0% with stage IV.\n [9] They found that the lifetime risk of undergoing an operation for pelvic organ prolapse is reported to be 11-19%.\n [11, 14] \n\nThe discrepancy between prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse and the lifetime risk of operation points to the fact that some organ herniation may indicate a normal finding, or present asymptomatically in a subset of women. Swift et al investigated the symptoms and the level at which organ prolapse affected patients’ lives and did find a statistically significant association with POPQ stage. There was a significant correlation of the leading edge of the organ descent as it increased from -3cm to +7cm in association with reporting of symptoms.\n [15] \n\nIndications\nConsideration for surgical repair of apical (vaginal vault) or uterine prolapse is based on adequate assessment of the patient's symptoms and degree of bother, as well as a standard method to quantify prolapse. It is important to note that symptom severity may not correlate with the degree of prolapse. Some degrees of prolapse may be found without symptoms and could represent a normal physical finding.\n [15, 16] \n\nSymptoms may include the following\n [3, 17] :\n\n\n\n\n\nVaginal bulge\n\n\n\n\nPelvic pressure\n\n\n\n\nBleeding\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n\n\n\n\nSplinting or digitation (the need to manually assist in reducing prolapse, often to void or defecate)\n\n\n\n\nBack pain\n\n\n\nConcomitant symptoms may include the following\n [3, 17] :\n\n\n\n\n\nUrinary incontinence symptoms, such as stress, urgency, or postural incontinence\n\n\n\n\nBladder storage symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, or overactive bladder syndrome\n\n\n\n\nVoiding symptoms, such as hesitancy, slow stream, straining, incomplete emptying, or position-dependent voiding\n\n\n\n\nSexual dysfunction symptoms, such as dyspareunia or obstructed intercourse\n\n\n\n\nAnorectal dysfunction, such as fecal incontinence, flatal incontinence, fecal urgency, straining to defecate, constipation, and incomplete evacuation\n\n\n\nContraindications\nMany of the general contraindications to sacral colpopexy are the same for any surgical procedure. These may include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnemia\n\n\n\n\nBleeding diathesis or the need for anticoagulation\n\n\n\n\nSignificant cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities\n\n\n\n\nActive infection such as cystitis, bacterial or fungal vaginal infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, or active sexually transmitted disease\n\n\n\n\nActive venous thromboembolism\n\n\n\n\nUncontrolled hyperglycemia\n\n\n\nOther contraindications specific to sacral colpopexy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nVaginal cancer, cervical cancer, or uterine cancer that is untreated or cannot be adequately treated due to advanced stage\n\n\n\n\nFistulas such as vesicovaginal, rectovaginal, vesico-utero, or urethral fistulas\n\n\n\n\nPrevious pelvic prolapse repairs with infected or exposed foreign material and erosions\n\n\n\nRelative contraindications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPelvic irradiation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious pelvic surgery or prolapse repair, depending on the nature of the operation and the subsequent pathology, side effects, or complications (the existence of such may warrant additional diagnostic evaluation and may require additional surgical intervention or change of approach to prolapse repair)\n\n\n\n\nConcomitant cystocele, rectocele, or urinary incontinence (the existence of such pathology may require additional surgery, a vaginal approach, or a combined approach)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Salpingo-Oophorectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nSalpingo-oophorectomy is the removal of the fallopian tube (salpingectomy) and ovary (oophorectomy). (See the image below.) A unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is appropriate for patients in whom an ovary is unable to be preserved, including cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy with an inability to achieve hemostasis without removal of the tube and ovary, adnexal torsion in which the ovary and tube are necrotic, a tuboovarian abscess not responsive to antibiotics, or a benign ovarian mass in which there is no remaining normal ovarian tissue able to be conserved. A bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is generally one of three types: elective at time of hysterectomy for benign conditions, prophylactic in women with increased risk of ovarian cancer, or because of malignancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalpingo oophorectomy laparoscopic photo with landmarks noted. Clamping and transection down the left broad ligament. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe ovaries are the female pelvic reproductive organs that house the ova and are also responsible for the production of sex hormones. They are paired organs located on either side of the uterus within the broad ligament below the uterine (fallopian) tubes. The ovary is within the ovarian fossa, a space that is bound by the external iliac vessels, obliterated umbilical artery, and the ureter. The ovaries are responsible for housing and releasing ova, or eggs, necessary for reproduction. At birth, a female has approximately 1-2 million eggs, but only 300 of these eggs will ever become mature and be released for the purpose of fertilization.\n\n\n\n\nThe uterine tubes are uterine appendages located bilaterally at the superior portion of the uterine cavity. These tubes exit the uterus through an area referred to as the cornua, forming a connection between the endometrial and peritoneal cavities. Each uterine tube is approximately 10 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter and is situated within the mesosalpinx. The mesosalpinx is a fold in the broad ligament. The distal portion of the uterine tube ends in an orientation encircling the ovary. The primary function of the uterine tubes is to transport sperm toward the egg, which is released by the ovary, and to then allow passage of the fertilized egg back to the uterus for implantation.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Ovary Anatomy and Uterine Tube (Fallopian Tube) Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nIndications for salpingo-oophorectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nElective: Removal of normal appearing ovaries and tubes at the time of a concurrent surgery, commonly a hysterectomy for benign disease, to decrease the risk of development of ovarian pathology, and decrease the need for future procedures\n\n\n\n\nMalignancy: Ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, or metastases to ovaries from a distant primary malignancy (gastrointestinal, breast, lung carcinoma)\n\n\n\n\nRisk reducing: Removal of ovaries and tubes in women genetically susceptible to ovarian cancer\n\n\n\n\nBenign adnexal mass\n\n\n\n\nAdnexal torsion\n\n\n\n\nTuboovarian abscess\n\n\n\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\n\n\n\nEndometriosis\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThere are no absolute contraindications for a salpingo-oophorectomy. Severe pelvic adhesive disease may influence the approach to surgery. Risks of the procedure must be weighed against potential benefits for each individual patient.\n\nTechnical considerations\nBest practices\n\nThe number of salpingo-oophorectomies performed as elective procedures is decreasing.\n [1] At this time, there is inconclusive evidence of the benefits versus the risks of undergoing an elective salpingo-oophorectomy in women who are not at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. The lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer in women who have no additional risk factors is 1 in 71.\n [2] A bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy has been demonstrated to decrease this risk; for every 220 bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies performed, one case of ovarian cancer will be prevented.\n\nHowever, the decreased risk of developing ovarian cancer needs to be weighed against the effects of decreased hormone levels after salpingo-oophorectomy.\n [3] The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations state, “Strong consideration should be given to retaining normal ovaries in premenopausal women who are not at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer.”\n [4] \n\nPatients with known BRCA mutations, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, invasive ovarian, or endometrial cancer are not candidates for ovarian conservation.\n [4] In BRCA-positive patients, the lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is 20-50%; a prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy decreases the risk of developing ovarian cancer by 80-90%.\n [4]  In addition, prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations for 5 years after the procedure.\n [5] \n\nComplication prevention\n\nAlthough the incidence of injury to internal organs (bowel, bladder, ureter, blood vessels, and nerves) is rare, it does occur. Patients with prior surgeries, history of pelvic infection, endometriosis, or other causes of adhesive disease are at greater risk. Ureteral injury may occur by clamping, transection, and ligation of the ureter, kinking of the ureter resulting in obstruction, or disruption of the ureteral blood supply.\n [6] \n\nA common location of ureteral injury is at the pelvic brim, where it is in close proximity to the infundibulopelvic ligament. Prevention of ureteral injury occurs by direct visualization, palpation, or possible ureteral catheterization with lighted stents. If there is a question of possible injury, a cystoscopy may be performed.\n\nRisk factors for nerve injury include the length of procedure (over 4 hours), thin patient, improper positioning, self-retaining retractors, and extensive tissue dissection.\n [7] Common nerves injured during pelvic surgery include the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator, sciatic, common peroneal, and the brachial plexus.\n [7] \n\nTo minimize the risk of nerve injuries, the surgeon should ensure appropriate padding between the patient and the table, stirrups, and arm boards. If the patient is to be positioned in dorsal lithotomy position, minimal thigh abduction and external hip rotation should be used. If a procedure continues for more than 4 hours, it may be helpful to reposition the patient if possible.\n\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is not required for a salpingo-oophorectomy, whether performed laparoscopically or open. However, when performed in combination with a hysterectomy, antibiotics are recommended for prevention of postoperative infections. In patients in whom there is a suspicion of infection, the addition of appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.\n [8] \n\nTherapy required for prevention of deep venous thromboses depends on the type of procedure, the patient's age, and other risk factors. Low-risk patients may only require early ambulation, whereas patients who are at higher risk may require heparin therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression devices.\n [9] \n\nAbsorbable adhesion barriers are available and are used by some practitioners for the prevention of adhesion formation. There are several types of adhesion barriers available for use; some barriers have more supportive data than others.\n [10, 11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Salpingostomy and Salpingectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nTubal disease accounts for approximately one-third of female-associated infertility, with the majority of cases being due to a history of salpingitis.\n [1]  While in vitro fertilization (IVF) tends to be the common treatment option for those women with tubal factor infertility, reparative surgical intervention remains an option.\nAssessment of tubes\nReconstructive surgery should not be performed until a complete infertility evaluation of the couple has been made. A prior history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), endometriosis, or ectopic pregnancy increases the likelihood of having tubal factor infertility. \n\n\nThe gold standard for evaluating the patency of tubes is diagnostic laparoscopy. However, given the invasive nature of a laparoscopy, a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) often serves as the nonsurgical test commonly used for identifying tubal pathology.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nCompared to laparoscopy, the HSG has moderate sensitivity (ability to detect patency when the tubes are open) but relatively high specificity. The sensitivity of the HSG for the determination of tubal patency ranges from 76-96%, with its specificity ranging from 67-100%.\n [2]  In other words, when an HSG suggests that both tubes are proximally occluded, there is a small likelihood that the tubes actually are open.\n [3]  However, if the HSG demonstrates patency, there is little chance that the tubes are blocked. The diagnosis of distal tubal occlusion is generally accurate, but proximal tubal occlusion may be the result of uterine contractions or catheter placement as opposed to true pathologic obstruction.\nA review estimated the sensitivity and specificity of HSG in detecting any tubal pathology to be 53% and 87%, respectively. For bilateral tubal disease, the sensitivity and specificity were noted to be 46% and 95%, respectively.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nHysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography is another method of assessing tubal status using saline-air bubble instillation with transvaginal sonography. This method is reliable if tubes are patent; however, this method is limited when identifying abnormal tubes, with sensitivity being reported as 89% and specificity as 46%.\n [5] \n\nIndications\nPatient selection for surgical treatment of infertility must be individualized and carefully considered. Several variables need to be considered and discussed with patients prior to recommending tubal surgery versus IVF. Patient age, their ovarian reserve (an indirect quantification of number of remaining eggs), presence of other infertility factors (including sperm factors), extent of tubal damage, number of desired children, experience of the surgeon, and success rates of their IVF program are some factors that need to be considered prior to making a decision.\n\nThe advantages of IVF include a higher per-cycle success rate, limited invasiveness, likely having multiple children from one egg retrieval (using frozen embryos), and a lower likelihood of having an ectopic pregnancy. The advantages of tubal surgery include being typically less expensive with couples attempting pregnancy every month without intervention and possibly conceiving more than once over the course of time. \n\nIn general, IVF is most often used to treat infertility caused by tubal disease. IVF is the only treatment available for severely damaged, inoperable fallopian tubes and for situations in which tubal disease is concurrent with another fertility factor. However, reconstructive tubal surgery, such as salpingostomy and salpingectomy, should be considered in select individuals.\n\nSalpingectomy is the surgical removal of a fallopian tube. Salpingostomy (also called neosalpingostomy) is the creation of an opening into the fallopian tube, but the tube itself is not removed in this procedure. Another term, fimbrioplasty, is often used instead of salpingostomy because salpingostomy does not specifically address the fimbriae. Reconstruction that preserves the delicate fimbriae is important for fertility outcomes. The purpose of fimbrioplasty is to open the obstructed fallopian tube and salvage enough function of the fimbriae to allow successful entrapment and transportation of the oocyte.\n\nDistal tubal obstruction is found to be the culprit of tubal disease in the majority of cases. Various techniques of treating or bypassing tubal disease include either open or laparoscopic surgery, namely salpingectomy or salpingostomy, or assisted reproductive techniques. Fimbrioplasty is performed for patients who have patent fallopian tubes, whereas salpingostomy is performed with occluded tubes. Many times, patients have pelvic adhesions and phimosis of the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube.\n\nSurgical treatment should be considered for all women with hydrosalpinges prior to IVF treatment. In cases of sonographically apparent hydrosalpinges, a salpingectomy, rather than a salpingostomy, is the preferred route of treatment. Some couples, however, may prefer a salpingostomy, which offers some potential of a spontaneous pregnancy; however, leaving a hydrosalpinx in place can decrease the likelihood of success with IVF.\n [6]  \n\nThe decision to remove or repair the fallopian tube(s) is often made intraoperatively. Distal tubal disease, such as distal hydrosalpinges, peritubal adhesions, and fimbrial phimosis (narrowing of the tubal opening) can be amenable to neosalpingostomy or fimbrioplasty. \n\nPatients with a good prognosis have limited filmy adhesions, mildly dilated tubes (< 3 cm) with thin walls, and preservation of the mucosal folds\n [7]  and can have a neosalpingostomy or fimbrioplasty performed. Patients with a poor prognosis, ie, those with thick, dense peritubal adhesions, significantly dilated tubes (>3 cm) with thick walls, and limited luminal mucosa, tend to require a salpingectomy. \n\nContraindications\nReconstructive tubal surgery is not recommended in a woman of advanced maternal age. Given the low monthly chance of pregnancy following surgery in the setting of an already reduced fecundability in a woman of advanced maternal age, IVF is the better treatment option. In contrast, reconstructive surgery for a young woman with minimal tubal disease is a reasonable option.\n\nIn general, patients who fail to conceive after primary tubal reconstructive surgery have severely limited success with repeat surgical procedures. In these cases, a second surgical procedure is not recommended and IVF is strongly indicated.\n\nIn a retrospective study of 434 infertile women who underwent laparoscopic salpingostomy, Audebert et al found evidence that the procedure should not be utilized in certain patients, based on factors such as tubal or adhesion stage and chlamydial serology. The investigators, who measured outcomes in terms of intrauterine pregnancy, delivery, and ectopic pregnancy rates (as achieved without IVF), reported poor-prognosis patterns in association with the following\n [8] :\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 3 or 4 endometriosis \n\n\n\n\nPrevious ectopic pregnancy\n\n\n\n\nSevere adhesive disease\n\n\n\n\nPrior salpingostomy\n\n\n\n\nPositive chlamydial serology test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Scalp Lead Placement": "\nBackground\n\n\nInternal cardiac monitoring with a scalp lead is used to identify fetuses at risk for serious complications from hypoxia during labor. Labor represents a unique stress on the fetus in utero. Uterine contractions reduce the flow of maternal blood to the placenta, in some cases uncovering a deficit in placental capacity. In addition, labor and the associated rupture of the chorioamnion may be associated with various other pregnancy risks, including intrauterine bacterial infection, umbilical cord compression, and placental abruption.\nRecording the fetal heart rate in labor was developed in the 1960s as a means of assessing fetal status and documenting fetal well-being. Currently, 2 technologies are commonly available: an “external” monitor that uses Doppler technology to identify fetal heart motion via a sensor applied to the maternal abdomen and an “internal” monitor that directly records the fetal ECG via a single electrode applied to the fetal scalp (a fetal scalp electrode). Inherent differences are observed between the signal recordings via these 2 methods. The fetal scalp electrode detects actual beat-to-beat electrical signals of the fetal heart, whereas the external monitor uses an \"averaging algorithm\" to smooth the signal generated from the Doppler.\n\n\nRegardless of the technology, the result is a recorded fetal heart rate. The fetal heart rate pattern is interpreted according to a standard set of criteria\n [1] with the goal being to identify fetuses at risk for serious complications during labor. The system remains imperfect, as a large number of fetuses display patterns that are neither clearly normal (category 1) or clearly abnormal (category 3). However, the ability to perform continuous fetal heart monitoring in labor is part of the standard of care for an obstetric unit in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Sentinel Node Biopsy for Vulvar/Cervical Cancer": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe hypothesis of sentinel node biopsy is that, if one or more sentinel lymph nodes are negative for malignancy, the remaining regional lymph nodes will also be negative. At least in theory, if the sentinel node shows no evidence of metastatic involvement, a complete node dissection can be avoided.\nVulvar cancer\nVulvar cancer accounts for less than 5% of all gynecologic malignancies.\n [1] The American Cancer Society estimated that, in 2011, 4340 women would be diagnosed with vulvar cancer, with approximately 940 deaths.\n [2] \n\n\nOverall, 30% of patients with vulvar cancer are diagnosed with metastatic disease to the inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes.\n [1] Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor for survival in vulvar cancer. Independent risk factors for inguinal lymph node metastases include clinical lymph node status, tumor grade, lymph vascular space invasion, depth of invasion, and age.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, assessment with clinical palpation of the inguinal lymph nodes is unreliable in identifying nodal disease. Of patients with nodes deemed clinically normal, 16%-24% have metastatic disease, while 24%-41% of those with nodes deemed to be involved clinically have negative histologic examination results.\n [3, 4] \nThe inaccuracy of physical examination in detecting inguinal node metastases has led to the use of various radiologic imaging techniques for assessment. However, no single imaging technique has been consistently reliable in the detection of node involvement.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nA systematic review of the medical literature from 1979-2004 compared the results of noninvasive and minimally invasive radiologic modalities versus histology from an inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy to determine groin node status. Index tests included ultrasonography with or without fine-needle aspiration, CT scanning, MRI, positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, and sentinel node identification using blue dye and99m Tc nanocolloid. Noninvasive tests were less accurate than invasive tests in predicting the groin node status; MRI was the most accurate, with a sensitivity of 86% and a negative likelihood ratio (LR) of 0.4. Sentinel node biopsy using99m Tc nanocolloid had a pooled sensitivity of 97% and a negative LR of 0.21. This procedure is the most accurate test reviewed to date.\n [3] \n\nAlthough sentinel node biopsy is accepted as a feasible alternative, many oncologists consider complete inguinofemoral dissection as the criterion standard for staging and diagnostic identification of metastatic disease. Surgical staging of vulvar cancer has changed dramatically since en bloc dissections were performed in the 1970s, which included resection of the vulva, mons pubis, and bilateral inguinofemoral and pelvic nodes in one large specimen. This radical dissection resulted in significant postoperative morbidity in many patients.\n\nThe current surgical standard of care for clinical stage I/II disease with more than 1-mm depth of invasion confined to the vulva involves radical wide local incision or complete radical vulvectomy with unilateral or bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy.\n\nA retrospective analysis of 330 patients with vulvar cancer treated at the Mayo Clinic between 1955-1990 assessed disease-free interval and sites of failure in patients with squamous cell carcinoma treated with either unilateral or bilateral complete inguinofemoral node dissections. Approximately 34% of patients had involvement of the inguinofemoral nodes, while approximately 65% did not, which is consistent with other similar studies.\n\nDuring the study period, 192 patients died—17.9% of disease and 3.3% of treatment complications, and the remainder from other or unknown causes. Treatment failures, defined as recurrences or metastases, were more common in patients with inguinal metastasis at the time of primary surgery. The recurrence rate during the first 2 years of follow-up in this group was 32.7%, as opposed to 5.1% in patients with no evidence of inguinal lymph node metastasis. No failures were detected in the groin after 24 months of follow-up; however, 67% of patients with groin recurrences died within the first 2 years of follow-up. Overall, 35.2% of the patients who experienced treatment failure presented 5 years after initial treatment.\n [5] \n\nThis retrospective study highlights the importance of recognizing groin involvement early in the disease process and its implications for adjuvant treatment options. Many other studies have also supported the conclusion that the most important prognostic factor in vulvar carcinoma is the status of the regional lymph nodes and the grave significance of groin recurrence. Therefore, the complete inguinofemoral node dissection, with its very low false-negative rate for identification of metastases, provides a criterion standard to which new surgical techniques can be compared.\n\nThe impetus to develop an alternative surgical technique is the significant morbidity associated with a complete inguinofemoral nodal dissection. The primary morbidities include lymphedema (25%-35%), infection (40%-60%), and wound breakdown (15%-25%).\n [1] However, any new procedure that reduces morbidity must do so without compromising detection of metastatic disease or increasing the risk of groin recurrence.\n\nClinical research in vulvar cancer has focused on validating the accuracy of sentinel node identification in the inguinal lymph nodes. Sentinel node biopsy is a well-established technique for breast cancer and melanoma in the literature.\n [6] Recent case series have recently suggested sentinel lymph biopsy as an alternative to complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy for stage I/II vulvar cancer.\n\nIn a US cost-effectiveness and outcomes analysis between sentinel node biopsy and inguinofemoral nodal dissection in early-stage vulvar cancer, Erickson et al reported lower treatment costs ($65.2 million vs $76.8 million, respectively) and complications costs ($23,711 vs $31.198, respectively) with similar outcomes (3-y inguinofemoral recurrence-free survival: 96.9% vs 97.3%, respectively) for sentinel node biopsy.\n [7] \n\nCervical cancer\nOver 12,000 women were expected to be diagnosed with cervical cancer in the United States in 2011.\n [2] \n\nLymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor for recurrence and death and is a major determinant of treatment.\n [8] The standard surgical lymph node assessment in early cervical cancer is systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy, which is associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity, including prolonged operating time, increased blood loss, lymphocyst formation (20%), lymphedema (10%-15%), and, rarely, neural or vascular injury.\n [8] \n\nIn operable stage IB1 cervical cancer, the prevalence of lymph node metastases is estimated to be 15%-20%, which suggests that approximately 85% of patients who undergo a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy receive no direct benefit but are at risk of associated morbidities.\n [8] Use of sentinel node biopsy in patients with cervix cancer was developed to avoid a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy and its associated sequelae.\n [9] As discussed below, evidence suggests that sentinel node biopsy is a feasible method of lymph node assessment with a high detection rate and low false-negative rate.\n [10, 11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Shoulder Dystocia": "\nOverview\n\n\nShoulder dystocia was first described in 1730 and is an obstetric complication of cephalic vaginal deliveries during which the fetal shoulders do not deliver after the head has emerged from the mother’s introitus. It occurs when one or both shoulders become(s) impacted against the bones of the maternal pelvis (symphysis pubis and possibly the sacral promontory), as shown in the image below.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-dimensional sagittal view of shoulder dystocia during which, in this view, the anterior left shoulder is impacted behind the symphysis. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nSince this phenomenon occurs because of a relative size or positional discrepancy between the fetal and pelvic bony dimensions, it nearly always occurs in parturients undergoing cephalic vaginal delivery after 34 weeks’ gestation.\nShoulder dystocia occurs for mechanical reasons.\n [2, 3] During the fetal head’s cardinal movements of descent, flexion, and internal rotation within the bony pelvis, the shoulders descend to reach the pelvic inlet. During the head’s subsequent extension, delivery, and external rotation, prior to final expulsion, the shoulders need to rotate within the bony pelvis in a winding fashion to arrive in the most accommodating dimension of the pelvic outlet, its oblique diameter. If either the fetal shoulder dimensions are too large or the maternal pelvis is too narrow, or both, to permit shoulder rotation to the oblique pelvic diameter, persistent anteroposterior orientation of the fetal shoulders may result in the anterior shoulder being obstructed behind the symphysis pubis impeding delivery and leading to shoulder dystocia. If the sacral promontory also obstructs the posterior shoulder, bilateral (and more difficult) shoulder dystocia occurs.\n\n\n\n\nDirect antenatal risk factors for shoulder dystocia are listed below in order from greatest to least risk:\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of shoulder dystocia in a prior vaginal delivery\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nFetal macrosomia (having a disproportionately large body compared to head)\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nDiabetes/impaired glucose tolerance (false-positive glucose challenge test)\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk factors for macrosomia, which are indirect markers for shoulder dystocia, are delineated below:\n\n\n\n\n\nExcessive weight gain (>35 lb) during pregnancy\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nMaternal obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2)\n [7, 8] \n\n\n\n\nAsymmetric accelerated fetal growth in nondiabetic patients\n [9] \n\n\n\n\nPostterm pregnancy\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nParity\n [10] \n\n\n\nIntrapartum risk factors are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitous second stage (< 20 min)\n [11, 12] \n\n\n\n\nOperative vaginal delivery (vacuum, forceps, or both)\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nProlonged second stage\n [5] \n\n\n\nWithout regional anesthesia (>2 h for nulliparous patients, or >1 h for multiparous patients)\n\nWith regional anesthesia (>3 h for nulliparous patient, >2 h for others)\n\n\n\n\n\n          Induction of labor for impending macrosomia\n          \n [13, 14] \n\n\n\nAs a preventive measure, induction of labor for impending macrosomia does not decrease shoulder dystocia incidence.\n [13] Despite these well-defined risk factors, shoulder dystocia is impossible to predict before delivery of the head because most patients with multiple risk factors do not experience it, and many shoulder dystocia deliveries occur in patients with no risk factors.\n [14, 15]  Third trimester ultrasound screening that indicated a higher estimated fetal weight (>4000 g) had only 22% sensitivity in predicting shoulder dystocia.\n [16] Severe shoulder dystocia can occur during delivery of a small-for-gestational-age infant.\n [17] The poor predictability relates to shoulder dystocia being caused by a dynamic and evolving mechanical event, rather than by simply the presence of specific antenatal or intrapartum clinical risk factors.\n\nAlthough shoulder dystocia is virtually impossible to predict or prevent in an individual patient, it has been shown prospectively that the incidence of shoulder dystocia can be reduced in a population by diagnosing and treating mild gestational diabetes mellitus (defined as 2 or more abnormal values after a 3-hour 100-g oral glucose-tolerance test, but with a glucose fasting level < 95 mg/dL). Treating these patients with self-monitoring of blood glucose, diet, and insulin therapy, as needed, resulted in a significant decrease in large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, cesarean deliveries, and shoulder dystocia (by 60%).\n [18]  Whether changing the criteria for diabetic diagnosis, thereby increasing the diabetic rate from 5% to 18% of pregnancies, is an overall effective management strategy or not, is under considerable obstetric debate.\n [19, 20] \n\nIn a prospective randomized trial, the incidence of shoulder dystocia was significantly reduced with a push-back maneuver in the final stages of the second stage.\n [21]  The push-back maneuver is a preventive obstetric maneuver that is performed gently on the fetal head, with the aim of helping the anterior shoulder slip behind the symphysis pubis, to give the shoulders more time to enter the pelvic cavity.\n\nConsidered an obstetric emergency, shoulder dystocia can result in significant fetal and maternal harm if not resolved in a competent and expedient manner. Cord pH drops with increasing head-to-body delivery interval, but the drop does not become clinically significant for about 5 minutes.\n [22, 23]  For an otherwise healthy fetus, a head-to-body delivery interval less than or equal to 6 minutes has been demonstrated not to be a risk factor for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).\n [24] Beyond that time, however, there is increased risk of neonatal depression, acidosis, asphyxia, central nervous system damage, and death.\n [25, 26] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Surgical Management of Ectopic Pregnancy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nThe first successful surgical management of a ruptured tubal pregnancy occurred in April 1883, when the British surgeon Robert Lawson Tait performed a laparotomy and ligated the ruptured tube and the broad ligament. At a time when ectopic pregnancy was associated with a greater than 60% mortality rate, Tait lost only 2 of the first 42 patients on whom he operated.\n\n\nBy the 1920s, laparotomy and ligation of the bleeding vessels with removal of the affected tube had become the standard of care, and it remained so until the late 1970s, when operative laparoscopy and salpingostomy replaced laparotomy and salpingectomy.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, medical therapy for ectopic pregnancy was implemented; it has now replaced surgical therapy in many cases. Thus, in less than 3 decades, management of ectopic pregnancy has evolved from emergency surgical treatment to conservative medical treatment.\n [1, 2, 3, 4] \n\n\n\n\nGo to Ectopic Pregnancy, Emergent Management of Ectopic Pregnancy, and Ultrasonographic Imaging in the Diagnosis of Ectopic Pregnancy for complete information on these topics.\n\n\n\n\nFor patient education resources, see Ectopic Pregnancy.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe uterine tubes are uterine appendages located bilaterally at the superior portion of the uterine cavity. These tubes exit the uterus through an area referred to as the cornua, forming a connection between the endometrial and peritoneal cavities. Each uterine tube is approximately 10 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter and is situated within the mesosalpinx. The mesosalpinx is a fold in the broad ligament. The distal portion of the uterine tube ends in an orientation encircling the ovary. The primary function of the uterine tubes is to transport sperm toward the egg, which is released by the ovary, and to then allow passage of the fertilized egg back to the uterus for implantation.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Uterine Tube (Fallopian Tube) Anatomy.\n\nIndications\nIndications for surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patient is not a suitable candidate for medical therapy.\n\n\n\n\nMedical therapy has failed.\n\n\n\n\nThe patient has a heterotopic pregnancy with a viable intrauterine pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\nThe patient is hemodynamically unstable and needs immediate treatment.\n\n\n\nContraindications\nThe only contraindications to surgical management are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patient has a medically treatable ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\nThe patient has other medical conditions that would make the risks associated with surgery unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Technological advances in ultrasonography such as 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional ultrasonography are in high demand, both from the public and the general medical community.\n [1] Concern for the viability of pregnancy, fetal anomalies, and fetal well-being are commonly evaluated with obstetric ultrasonography.\nFor myriad reasons, it is beneficial to have a basic understanding of the targeted obstetric ultrasound examination. Questions regarding obstetric ultrasound indications, safety, and implications of imaging findings may come up in the course of daily practice.

        "Vacuum Extraction": "\nIntroduction and History\n\n\nThis article reviews the clinical use of vacuum extractor (VE) delivery instruments in modern obstetric management. The limitations and risks of the VE are considered, as is the choice of delivery technique (VE vs forceps vs cesarean delivery) when labor ceases or other complications ensue.\nBoth forceps and the VE are in use as delivery instruments. In recent decades, the VE has progressively replaced forceps as the instrument of choice for many practitioners.\n [1, 2] In the United States, more than 80% of operative vaginal deliveries involve vacuum extraction.\n [3] Active controversy concerns if and when operative vaginal deliveries should be conducted and which instrument is the best to use in specific clinical settings.\n\n\nVE has a long history. The initial applications of vacuum techniques in deliveries began in the 18th century. While VE became widely popular in Europe, the technique was little used in the United States until after the early 1980s, following the introduction of a series of new instruments, including disposable soft-cup extractors, new rigid cup designs, and handheld vacuum pumps.\nDespite the current popularity of VE, forceps are the instrument of choice for many older clinicians. This is because of medical conservatism and original training, higher success rates, and a presumption of improved speed and control of the birth process. Nonetheless, VE has gained popularity as it is seemingly easy to use, requires less anesthesia/analgesia, has lower maternal morbidity, and is commonly believed to be safe. Large differences are observed in the popularity of instrumental delivery and of the specific type of instrument used in varying parts of the United States. This reflects the biases introduced by original training, the inherent conservatism of practitioners in embracing different techniques, and the absence of fixed guidelines for instrumentation.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nThe retirement of classically trained obstetricians, the inability to conduct training operations (which is now partially offset by new training models), the medical-legal climate, and other changes in practice (including the high incidence of cesarean deliveries) result in an unclear future for all types of instrumental delivery, including VE. Finding clear answers to important management questions concerning instrumental delivery remains elusive. A great deal of traditional lore concerning delivery practices remains. Objective analysis of what constitutes best practice by the newer methods of evidence-based medicine is limited by continuous changes in practice, small patient numbers in many studies, changes in the official definition of procedures, and, especially for VE, the introduction of new instruments.\n\n\n\n\nDespite these limitations, a need still remains for safe and effective operative vaginal delivery options. Further, good data suggest that this help can be safely and expeditiously provided by an instrumental delivery using either the forceps or a VE instrument.\n [5, 6, 7] \n\nFor related information, see Medscape's Pregnancy Resource Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Delivery": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\n“Once a cesarean, always a cesarean.” From 1916, when these words were spoken to the New York Association of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, through the ensuing 50-60 years, this statement reflected most of US obstetricians’ management of patients with a prior cesarean delivery. By 1988, the overall cesarean delivery rate was 25%, rising from less than 5% in the early 1970s. Only 3% of live-born infants were delivered vaginally after the mother had undergone a prior cesarean delivery.\n\n\nAlthough attempts at a trial of labor after a cesarean birth (TOLAC) have become accepted practice, the rate of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC), as well as the rate of attempted VBACs, has decreased during the past 10 years (see the image below). Whereas, 40-50% of women attempted VBAC in 1996, as few as 20% of patients with a prior cesarean delivery attempted a trial of labor in 2002. This number is drifting down toward the 10% mark with fewer than 10% of women achieving successful VBAC in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates. \n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, despite the known risks (0.5-1% rate of uterine rupture), TOLAC remains an attractive option for many patients and leads to a successful outcome in a high proportion of cases. In comparison, the alternative of elective repeat cesarean delivery is not without risks. In addition to the inherent risks that cesarean delivery has over vaginal delivery, patients may experience uterine rupture prior to the onset of labor.\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to undergo TOLAC is an individual one that should be based on careful, thorough counseling.\n [1] Maternal characteristics and obstetric history can provide a patient a rough estimate of her chance of a successful trial of labor. This same obstetric history can be used to estimate a patient’s risk of uterine rupture.\n\nIf possible, avoid induction of labor, because induction of labor decreases the probability of success and increases the chance of uterine rupture in a trial of labor after cesarean delivery. Counsel patients who elect to undergo TOLAC to be evaluated early in labor and to manage the pregnancy in a hospital setting in which uterine rupture can be both recognized and managed expediently.\n\nCertainly, counseling should address the question of whether patients are interested in subsequent pregnancies after the current pregnancy. Undergoing 2 prior cesarean deliveries further increases the risks of VBAC in a subsequent pregnancy; thus, for a future pregnancy, having had a successful VBAC offers protection after undergoing the risk in the current pregnancy.\n\nGo to Cesarean Delivery and Perimortem Cesarean Delivery for complete information on these topics.\n\nFor patient education resources, see the Pregnancy and Reproduction Center, as well as Labor Signs.\n\nACOG Guidelines\nSeveral factors have contributed to the decline in VBAC. As practitioners experience complications related to managing patients undergoing trials of labor after cesarean delivery, they are less likely to allow new patients to undergo a trial of labor. In addition, 1999 guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stated explicitly that patients undergoing TOLAC require the presence of an obstetrician, an anesthesiologist, and/or a staff capable of performing an emergency cesarean delivery throughout the patient’s active phase of labor.\n [2] \n\nWhereas academic centers and larger community hospitals are able to comply with these requirements, many smaller hospitals do not offer in-house anesthesia or obstetric staff. Furthermore, to meet the financial demands of managed care, many obstetricians now cover more than one hospital simultaneously, making it difficult to comply with the 1999 guidelines.\n\nThe impact of these changes can be observed in national birth statistics. The cesarean delivery rate peaked at 25% in 1988 but then declined to 21% overall in 1996. From 1996 to 2004, however, the cesarean delivery rate increased to 29.2%, while the rate of VBAC declined from 28% to 9%. On the assumption that the overall VBAC success rate is about 70%, this correlates with a decline from 40% to 14% in the number of patients choosing to undergo TOLAC.\n\nWhat once was hailed as a key component of lowering the overall cesarean birth rate (ie, TOLAC) is losing the support it had in the 1980s. Overall, this has led to a rate of cesarean delivery of 31.1% in 2006, which is the highest rate in US history and shows no signs of decreasing.\n\nIn 2010, with these developments in mind, ACOG issued new guidelines that were somewhat less restrictive.\n [3, 4] The 2010 guidelines, based on consensus and expert opinion, recommend that TOLAC should be undertaken at facilities capable of emergency deliveries. Because of the risks associated with TOLAC and complications such as uterine rupture that may be unpredictable, ACOG recommends that TOLAC be undertaken in facilities with staff immediately available to provide emergency care.\n\nHowever, when resources for immediate cesarean delivery are not available, health care providers and patients considering TOLAC should discuss the hospital’s resources and availability of obstetric, pediatric, anesthetic, and operating room staffs. Respect for patient autonomy supports allowing patients to accept increased levels of risk; however, patients should be clearly informed of such potential increase in risk and counseled about management alternatives.\n\nRecognizing that TOLAC was decreasing at community and more rural hospitals, ACOG revised these recommendations in 2017 with an apparent goal in softening the recommendation for immediate availability of surgical teams. The language now reads \"ACOG recommends that TOLAC be attempted in facilities that can provide cesarean delivery for situations that are immediate threats to the life of the woman and the fetus\". This more nuanced statement may result in an increase in attempted TOLAC at these facilities.\n [5] \n\nOn the basis of level A evidence, the 2017 ACOG guidelines make the following recommendations\n [5] :\n\n\n\n\n\nMost women with a prior cesarean delivery with a low transverse incision are candidates for VBAC and should be offered TOLAC.\n\n\n\n\nEpidural anesthesia may be used as part of TOLAC.\n\n\n\n\nMisoprostol should not be used for patients who have had a prior cesarean delivery or major uterine surgery.\n\n\n\nOn the basis of level B evidence, TOLAC may be considered for the following patients\n [5] :\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen with 2 previous low transverse cesarean deliveries\n\n\n\n\nWomen with 1 previous cesarean delivery with a low transverse incision who are otherwise appropriate candidates for twin vaginal delivery\n\n\n\n\nWomen with 1 previous cesarean delivery of unknown incision type, unless clinical suspicion of a previous classical uterine incision is high\n\n\n\n\nWomen with 1 previous cesarean delivery who are otherwise appropriate candidates for twin vaginal delivery. \n\n\n\nLevel B evidence was also found for the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nInduction of labor during TOLAC is not contraindicated.\n\n\n\n\nIn women with a prior low transverse uterine incision who are at low risk for adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes from external cephalic version and TOLAC, external cephalic version for breech presentation is not contraindicated.\n\n\n\n\nContinuous fetal heart rate monitoring is recommended during TOLAC\n\n\n\nA comparison of VBAC in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada showed understandable similarities but numerous unexplained differences in recommendations.\n [6] \n\nOutcomes of Interest\nTwo specific outcomes of interest regarding TOLAC have been well investigated: successful VBAC and uterine rupture. Other outcomes are certainly of interest, including neonatal outcome, hysterectomy, and maternal mortality; however, few studies have focused on these outcomes, and poor outcomes occur too rarely to be well represented in established databases.\n\nIn earlier studies, most outcomes were reported after univariate analysis. Risk factors were examined without controlling for potential confounding variables, and results were reported as a relative risk or odds ratio. These ratios represent the risk of the group of individuals who have the risk factor divided by individuals without the risk factor. Over the last decade, several large cohorts have examined predictors and outcomes related to women with a prior cesarean delivery. These studies have ranged from Nova Scotia to Boston to the state of Washington.\n\nFinally, 2 large multicenter studies have been publishing multiple studies on this issue, one out of Pennsylvania and the other out of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units. These large studies over the last decade have used multivariate statistics to examine risk factors. This means that other risk factors and confounding factors, such as birth weight, maternal age, obstetric history, and labor management, were controlled for in the analysis.\n\nIn this article, factors associated with mode of delivery in the setting of a trial of labor and factors associated with uterine rupture in this same setting are reviewed.\n\nIndications\nThe predictors of successful TOLAC are extensively described in the existing literature (see the table below). Although no randomized trials have been conducted, relatively large databases have been analyzed (with both univariate and multivariate techniques) to determine risk factors for patients undergoing TOLAC. In addition, several scoring systems have been devised to help predict which patients are likely to be successful when attempting VBAC. These scoring systems are quite varied and may inform the discussion with the patient about TOLAC. However, there are no prospective studies that demonstrate that these systems improve perinatal outcomes. Examples of these calculators can be found on the ACOG website.  \n\n\n\nTable 1. Predictors of VBAC Success or Failure (Open Table in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Chance of Success\nDecreased Chance of Success\n\n\nPrior vaginal delivery\nMaternal obesity\n\n\nPrior VBAC\nShort maternal stature\n\n\nSpontaneous labor\nMacrosomia\n\n\nFavorable cervix\nIncreased maternal age (>40 y)\n\n\nNonrecurring indication (breech presentation, placenta previa, herpes)\nInduction of labor\n\n\nPreterm delivery\nRecurring indication (cephalopelvic disproportion, failed second stage)\n\n\n \nIncreased interpregnancy weight gain\n\n\n \nLatina or African American race/ethnicity\n\n\n \nGestational age ≥41 wk\n\n\n \nPreconceptional or gestational diabetes mellitus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause no large, prospective, randomized, controlled trials have been conducted, most of the risk factors have been determined from retrospective cohort and case-control studies. These studies have been increasingly analyzed with multivariate techniques to control for confounding factors. However, control for physician practice is difficult, and physician practice can greatly impact the strength of the association between these risk factors and a successful VBAC.\n\nEven when demographic data, obstetric history, birth weight, gestational age, induction of labor, and other variables are controlled for, the bias inherent in nonrandomized and nonblinded trials cannot be eliminated.\n\nMaternal characteristics\nSeveral studies examine prepregnancy weight and height to examine the effect on mode of delivery. Not surprising, women who are shorter and women who are obese are more likely to undergo cesarean delivery. Of note, cesarean delivery has been associated not only with increased prepregnancy weight but also with increased gestational weight gain.\n\nAn increasing number of studies have been carried out in the setting of TOLAC, all of which show that women in the morbidly obese range have a higher risk of failing a trial of labor. Interpregnancy weight gain has been shown to increase the risk of failure in a subsequent trial of labor, but unfortunately, interpregnancy weight loss has not demonstrated an improvement in VBAC success.\n\nMaternal age has also been examined in several studies in VBAC literature. With confounding factors adjusted for, women older than 40 years who have had a prior cesarean delivery have an almost 3-fold higher risk for a failed trial of labor than do women younger than 40 years. In 1 scoring system, women younger than 40 years were given an extra point as a predictor for successful VBAC.\n [7] \n\nMaternal race or ethnicity has been examined as a predictor for VBAC in the setting of trial of labor and has not generally been noted to be a strong predictor. However, in the recent Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU) Cesarean Registry, both Hispanic ethnicity and African American ethnicity were associated with lower rates of successful trial of labor. Whether this association is due to actual biologic reasons or whether ethnicity is acting as a proxy for some other factor or factors remains to be elucidated.\n\nBirth weight\nBirth weight greater than 4000 g is associated with an almost 4-fold higher risk of cesarean birth among nulliparous women. Several studies have demonstrated a difference in VBAC rates between patients with a birth weight greater than 4000 g and those with a lower birth weight. In accordance with these findings, several studies have demonstrated a higher failure of a trial of labor with increasing birth weight.\n\nObstetric history\nObstetric history is enormously important in terms of risk factors for successful TOLAC. Predictors of increased success include a nonrecurring indication for prior cesarean delivery (eg, breech presentation, placenta previa) and prior vaginal delivery. A history of cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), failure to progress, no prior vaginal deliveries, or a prior cesarean delivery performed in the second stage of labor are negative predictors of success in a subsequent trial of labor.\n\nSeveral studies have examined indications for prior cesarean delivery as a predictor of outcome in subsequent TOLAC. In all studies, CPD had the lowest VBAC success rate (60-65%). Fetal distress (eg, nonreassuring fetal testing) had the second lowest success rate of VBAC (69-73%). Nonrecurrent indications, such as breech birth, herpes, and placenta previa, were associated with the highest rates of success (77-89%).\n\nFailure to progress, CPD, or dystocia as indications for prior cesarean delivery are also associated with a higher proportion of patients not attempting a trial of labor after cesarean birth. In a meta-analysis of the existing literature prior to 1990, Rosen et al demonstrated that women whose prior cesarean delivery was performed for CPD were twice as likely to have an unsuccessful trial of labor.\n [7] \n\nPatients with a prior vaginal delivery have higher rates of successful VBAC than patients without a prior vaginal birth. Furthermore, women with a successful VBAC have a higher success rate in a subsequent trial of labor compared with women whose vaginal delivery was prior to cesarean delivery.\n\nIn an unadjusted comparison, patients with 1 prior vaginal delivery had an 89% VBAC success rate compared with a 70% success rate in patients without a prior vaginal delivery. In comparable comparisons controlling for confounding factors, odds ratios of 0.3-0.5 for rate of cesarean delivery are found. Among patients with a prior VBAC, the success rate is 93%, compared with 85% in patients with a vaginal delivery prior to their cesarean birth but no prior VBAC. These findings have been repeatedly validated by multiple studies.\n\nOnly 1 study carefully examines cervical dilation at prior cesarean delivery. In this study, the degree of cervical dilation in the prior delivery is directly associated with the likelihood of success in a subsequent trial of labor. For example, 67% of patients who were dilated 5 cm or less at the time of their delivery had a successful VBAC, compared with 73% of patients who were dilated 6-9 cm.\n\nThe success rate is much lower for patients whose labor arrested in the second stage: only 13% of patients who were fully dilated at the time of their prior delivery had a successful VBAC. In a similar study, patients who had their prior cesarean delivery in the first stage of labor had a lower rate of cesarean delivery than those who had their prior cesarean delivery in the second stage of labor. However, in this study, 66% of patients who had a cesarean delivery for dystocia in the second stage had a successful VBAC.\n\nInduction of labor\nPatients who undergo induction of labor are at a higher risk of cesarean delivery than women who experience spontaneous labor. This finding has also been observed in women with a prior cesarean delivery. Several studies have demonstrated that women who are induced in TOLAC have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of cesarean delivery compared with those who present with spontaneous labor.\n\nOne study demonstrated that patients who could be induced with oxytocin had a significantly lower cesarean delivery rate compared with those induced with a Foley bulb.\n\nThe 2017 ACOG guidelines state that induction of labor for maternal or fetal indications remains an option in women undergoing TOLAC.\n [5] \n\nGestational age\nIncreasing gestational age is associated with a decreased rate of successful VBAC. Three potential factors are related to the association of increasing gestational age with an increased rate of cesarean delivery: increasing birth weight, increased risk of fetal intolerance of labor, and increased need for induction of labor. However, in a recent study that controlled for both birth weight and induction/augmentation of labor, gestational age of greater than 41 weeks was still associated with failed VBAC.\n\nCervical examination on admission\nNot surprisingly, patients who present to labor and delivery with advanced cervical examination findings have a greater success rate of vaginal birth. Several components of the cervical examination have been investigated, including cervical dilation and cervical effacement. Not surprisingly, the more advanced the cervical examination finding is upon initial presentation, the higher the rate of successful VBAC. A 1997 Flamm et al study demonstrated that patients presenting with dilation greater than or equal to 4 cm had an 86% rate of VBAC.\n [8] \n\nInterpregnancy interval\nThe timing between pregnancies has recently become an interesting predictor for a number of obstetric outcomes, VBAC success among them. In 1 analysis, women who had an interpregnancy interval of more than 18 months had an 86% chance of VBAC success, while women whose interpregnancy interval was less than 18 months had a VBAC success rate of 79%. This difference was not statistically significant, and it remains unclear whether the interpregnancy interval actually affects the success rate or whether it affects only the risk of uterine rupture.\n\nPreterm delivery\nPreterm labor and delivery deserves attention as an opportunity to recounsel women about the risks and benefits of a trial of labor after cesarean delivery. In a large study by Quinones et al, 12,463 attempted a trial of labor, and the VBAC success rates for the term and preterm groups were 74% and 82%, respectively.\n [9] Additionally, a trend toward decreased risk of uterine rupture among preterm delivery gestations was found. These data can certainly be used to counsel women with a prior cesarean who are in preterm labor.\n\nGestational or pregestational diabetes\nOnly 1 study of patients undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean delivery has examined the rate of success in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). This study demonstrated that patients with either gestational DM or pregestational DM had a lower rate of successful trial of labor. These findings are not particularly surprising; however, further studies are needed to sort out the differences between gestational and pregestational DM and the interaction between DM and birth weight.\n\nContraindications\nOne of the most significant risks women face when considering a trial of labor is that of uterine rupture. This potentially fatal event may have significant maternal and neonatal sequelae.\n\nA threshold of acceptable risk has been established between the risk reported in women with 1 prior cesarean delivery (0.5-1%) and that seen in women with a history of a prior classic cesarean delivery (6-12%). The latter patients, along with women who have undergone metroplasties for uterine anomalies or myomectomies that have entered the uterine cavity, are discouraged from attempting VBAC.\n\nOther patients who are at increased risk for uterine rupture include those who have had 2 or more hysterotomies, those who are treated with prostaglandin agents, and those undergoing induction of labor (see the table below).\n\n\n\nTable 2: Predictors of Uterine Rupture (Open Table in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Rate of Uterine Rupture\nDecreased Rate of Uterine Rupture \n\n\nClassic hysterotomy\nSpontaneous labor\n\n\nTwo or more cesarean deliveries\nPrior vaginal delivery\n\n\nSingle-layer closure\nLonger interpregnancy interval\n\n\nInduction of labor\nPreterm delivery\n\n\nUse of prostaglandins\n \n\n\nShort interpregnancy interval\n \n\n\nInfection at prior cesarean delivery\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNature of hysterotomy\nUnquestionably, practitioners do not feel safe allowing a patient who has had a prior classical hysterotomy (ie, a vertical incision that has extended above the insertion of the round ligaments) to undergo TOLAC. Patients with a prior classical hysterotomy have a higher rate of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies. Because these patients can sustain a uterine rupture prior to labor, they are often delivered at 36-37 weeks’ gestation. Although available data are limited, the risk of uterine rupture in this group of patients is estimated at 6-12%.\n\nRetrospective cohort studies have demonstrated that the risk of uterine rupture is no greater for patients who have had a vertical incision in the lower uterine segment than for those who have had a transverse incision. The rate of uterine rupture from these studies is 0.8-1.3%. When comparing patients with prior Krönig hysterotomies to patients with low transverse incisions, no statistical difference exists in either univariate or multivariate analyses controlling for the confounding factors of obstetrical history, induction of labor, birth weight, and length of labor.\n\nMost babies delivered abdominally are delivered through a transverse incision in the lower uterine segment (Kerr hysterotomy). In several large retrospective cohort studies, the reported rate of uterine rupture is 0.3-1% (see the table below).\n [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] Rates of 0.5-1% (1 in 200 to 1 in 100) are commonly used to counsel patients with no other additional risk factors.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Rates of Uterine Rupture (Open Table in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nSample Size (N)\nNo. of Uterine Ruptures (Rate) \n\n\nMiller (1994)\n10,880\n63 (0.6%)*\n\n\nFlamm (1994)\n5,022\n39 (0.8%)\n\n\nMcMahon (1996)\n3,249\n10 (0.3%)\n\n\nShipp (1999)\n2,912\n28 (1%)\n\n\nLandon (2004)\n17,898\n124 (0.7 %)\n\n\nMacones (2005)\n13,331\n128 (0.9%)\n\n\n*Includes unknown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen an operative report of a patient’s prior cesarean delivery is unavailable, the obstetric history may be helpful in determining the type of uterine incision. For example, a patient who underwent a cesarean delivery for a breech presentation at 28 weeks’ gestation has a much higher risk of a vertical uterine incision than the patient at term with arrest of dilation. Because most cesarean deliveries are via low transverse hysterotomies, the risk of uterine rupture for patients with an unknown uterine scar is usually similar to that of patients with a prior transverse incision.\n\nSeveral studies examining this issue have demonstrated that the rate of rupture for patients with an unknown uterine incision is approximately 0.6%. A case-control study of patients with and without uterine rupture did not find unknown hysterotomy to be a risk factor compared with low transverse hysterotomy.\n [16] \n\nAccording to the 2017 ACOG guidelines, TOLAC is not contraindicated for women with previous cesarean delivery with an unknown uterine scar type unless clinical suspicion of a previous classical uterine incision is high.\n [5] \n\nNumber of prior cesarean deliveries\nPatients with more than 1 prior cesarean delivery are at increased risk of uterine rupture. The unadjusted rate of uterine rupture for patients with 2 prior uterine incisions ranges from 1.8% to 3.7%.\n\nOne analysis demonstrated that when potential confounding variables (eg, prior vaginal delivery) are controlled for, patients who have had 2 prior cesarean deliveries have 5 times the risk of uterine rupture compared with patients who have had only 1 prior cesarean delivery. This finding contradicted several earlier studies that did not control for confounding factors, most importantly prior vaginal delivery.\n\nMore recently, a study that examined major complications overall found that while there was a statistically significant increase, the adjusted odds ratio was only 1.6.\n\nType of uterine closure\nWhereas the uterine hysterotomy had traditionally been closed in several layers, in the 1990s physicians at many institutions began closing the Kerr hysterotomy in a single layer. Because the lower uterine segment is quite thin, a single layer often afforded adequate hemostasis. Several recent studies have compared women whose hysterotomy was closed in a single layer with those whose hysterotomy was closed in 2 layers. Adjusted odds ratios of 3 to 4 for uterine rupture have been estimated for women who have a single-layer closure.\n\nPrior vaginal delivery\nPrior vaginal delivery appears to be protective for subsequent uterine rupture. A 2000 study by Zelop et al demonstrated that patients with a prior vaginal delivery had a 0.2% rate of rupture compared with 1.1% for patients with no prior vaginal delivery. An adjusted odds ratio controlling for confounding factors was 6.2.\n [17] \n\nNo studies have compared the rate of uterine rupture in patients with a prior VBAC with those with a vaginal delivery before their prior cesarean delivery. These findings have been validated in subsequent studies, though the effect size has not been quite as large.\n\nPrior infection\nA recent study demonstrated that women who had an infection at the time of the cesarean delivery have an increased rate of uterine rupture in a subsequent trial of labor. The assumed causal mechanism is poor healing of the hysterotomy secondary to the infection.\n\nLabor\nWhile labor appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture, many patients experience a uterine rupture prior to the onset of labor. In a large study using birth certificate data, one study found that the rate of uterine rupture before the onset of labor was 0.5%. Patients at greatest risk are those with prior classical hysterotomies. As a result of this potential risk, these patients are usually scheduled for delivery at 36-37 weeks’ gestation.\n\nWhen counseling this group of patients, however, mentioning that scheduling an early repeat cesarean delivery does not eliminate the risk of uterine rupture entirely is important.\n\nInduction of labor\nInduction of labor as a risk factor for uterine rupture has been examined over only the past 5 years. One large study, which did not control for confounding factors, demonstrated a uterine rupture rate of 2.3% in patients who had experienced induced labor. In several studies controlling for confounding factors, adjusted odds ratios were 2-4 for patients who were induced compared with those who presented in spontaneous labor.\n\nDespite these analyses, discerning whether induction of labor itself leads to uterine rupture or whether another risk factor (as yet unmeasured) is associated with both induction of labor and uterine rupture is difficult. When patients have an indication for induction of labor, the best course of management is to discuss the increase over their baseline risk of uterine rupture.\n\nUse of oxytocin\nIn the only prospective randomized trial in women with a prior cesarean delivery, oxytocin augmentation in early labor was compared with expectant management; 5 uterine ruptures occurred in the augmentation group (5%), and none occurred in the expectant management group. Excessive use of oxytocin has been described as leading to an increased risk of uterine rupture.\n\nA 1993 study by Leung et al demonstrated an odds ratio of 2.7 for uterine rupture in patients who used oxytocin compared with those without oxytocin augmentation.\n [16] However, this study included inductions and augmentation in both the latent and active phases. These confounding factors may have contributed to much of the difference because induction of labor alone has an increased risk.\n\nIn 2 subsequent studies, oxytocin augmentation was associated with uterine rupture.\n [18, 10] In the first study, although the odds ratio was 2.3, it was not statistically significant, probably because of inadequate statistical power. In the latter study, a similar odds ratio of 2.4 existed.\n\nBecause labor and delivery units use oxytocin widely, this oxytocin–uterine rupture relationship deserves careful consideration; the relationship directly affects management of patients. At this point, using oxytocin for induction and augmentation is probably advisable only when absolutely necessary.\n\nUse of prostaglandins\nEvidence regarding the use of prostaglandins for induction of labor remains scant. However, in the few trials that have been conducted, the trend is toward an increase in the rate of uterine rupture. In 1999, the use of prostaglandin E2 was demonstrated to have an adjusted odds ratio of 3.2. This study controlled for induction of labor, which appears to be an independent risk factor.\n\nIn 2001, Lydon-Rochelle et al demonstrated a 3-fold increase in the risk for uterine rupture when comparing patients induced with prostaglandins with those induced with oxytocin.\n [19] In the 2004 study by Landon et al, this effect of prostaglandin induction versus other means was smaller—less than 2-fold (odds ratio of 3.95 with prostaglandin, 2.48 without prostaglandin).\n [10] \n\nAs in studies examining the risk of uterine rupture in patients undergoing induction of labor, patients who were treated with prostaglandins were likely to have other confounding variables that were not controlled.\n\nIn particular, the prostaglandin misoprostol has been examined in small studies. In 1998, Wing et al reported a case series of 17 patients who were induced with misoprostol, in which 2 uterine ruptures occurred. These findings have led to the decreased use of prostaglandins for induction, particularly misoprostol.\n [20] \n\nUse of transcervical Foley bulb\nOnly one small study exists of patients with a prior cesarean being induced with the transcervical Foley bulb. In that study, the rate of uterine rupture was 1.1% with spontaneous labor, 1.2% with induction with amniotomy, and 1.6% with use of a transcervical Foley bulb. This rate is lower than some of the reported rates with prostaglandins, but it is unclear whether the increase seen in patients requiring cervical ripening is due to the need for cervical ripening or to the agents themselves.\n\nInterpregnancy interval\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that the shorter the amount of time between the cesarean delivery and the subsequent delivery, the higher the rate of uterine rupture. Commonly, thresholds of 18 and 24 months have been examined. Adjusted odds ratios range from 2.5 to 3 for an increased rate of uterine rupture in the women with less time between deliveries. The biologic plausibility of this effect is related to the amount of time required for the uterine scar to heal completely.\n\nTwin gestations\nA study by Cahill et al revealed that whereas women with twin gestations are less likely to undergo a trial of labor after prior cesarean, they appear to be at no increased risk for uterine rupture.\n [21] \n\nOther smaller studies examined the rate of uterine rupture in patients with twin gestation undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and none of them demonstrated a frank rupture—though when their data were combined, 5 asymptomatic dehiscences in 151 patients were identified.\n [22, 23, 24] \n\nThe rate of asymptomatic uterine dehiscence in patients undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is difficult to assess because it is not commonly investigated. Thus, although the overall statistical power of the studies examining this issue in twins is not overwhelming, there is certainly no evidence suggesting a higher risk of uterine rupture in these women.\n\nThe 2017 ACOG guidelines state that TOLAC may be considered in women with one previous cesarean delivery with a low transverse incision, who are otherwise appropriate candidates for twin vaginal delivery.\n [5] \n\nMullerian anomalies\nIn 1999, a small series by Ravasia et al examined patients with müllerian anomalies undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean delivery and reported 2 uterine ruptures among 25 patients (8%).\n [25] However, both patients with uterine rupture had undergone induction with prostaglandins; therefore, it is difficult to reach any firm conclusions about the relative risk of uterine rupture in this group of patients. The sample size in this study was certainly too small to consider particular types of uterine anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Vaginal Hysterectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nIn the United States, hysterectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Even with the increased use of conservative therapies, approximately 600,000 hysterectomies are performed each year.\n [1] \n\n\nHysterectomy may be performed vaginally, abdominally, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance, with the route depending primarily on physician choice. Factors to be considered in choosing the route for hysterectomy should include safety, cost-effectiveness, and the medical needs of the patient.\n [2]  A large body mass index (BMI)  may also play a role in the route chosen.\nIn a review that evaluated the outcomes of abdominal hysterectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, and vaginal hysterectomy in 2232 very obese and morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥35 kg/m2), investigators found that abdominal hysterectomy was associated with more postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence and wound infections and longer length of hospital stay in this patient population than were seen with the other two procedures.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nMost of the literature supports the view that vaginal hysterectomy, when feasible, is the safest and most cost-effective procedure for removal of the uterus.\n [4, 5]  Nevertheless, the abdominal route is the one most commonly chosen: 66% of hysterectomies are performed abdominally, 22% are performed vaginally, and 12% are performed laparoscopically.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nIndications\nThe most common indications for hysterectomy are symptomatic uterine leiomyomas, endometriosis, and uterine prolapse.\n [1, 7] \n\nContraindications\nThere are very few absolute contraindications for vaginal hysterectomy (eg, pregnancy, cancer). However, there are some factors that may influence the surgeon's choice of a route for hysterectomy, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgeon training and experience\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility of the uterus\n\n\n\n\nExtent of extrauterine disease\n\n\n\n\nSize and shape of the uterus\n\n\n\n\nNeed for concurrent procedures\n\n\n\n\nPatient preference\n\n\n\nThere are some relative contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy, such as the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarged uterus\n\n\n\n\nNulliparity\n\n\n\n\nNarrow vagina\n\n\n\n\nNarrow pubic arch (< 90º)\n\n\n\n\nImmobile uterus\n\n\n\nOther possible concerns that may militate against vaginal hysterectomy include extrauterine disease (eg, adnexal pathology), severe endometriosis, adhesions, and an indication for salpingo-oophorectomy. When these concerns arise, many surgeons choose to visualize the pelvis laparoscopically before deciding on the route for hysterectomy. The decision to perform a salpingo-oophorectomy should not be influenced by the chosen route for hysterectomy and is not a contraindication for vaginal hysterectomy.\n [4] \n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists made the following recommendations on choosing the route of hysterectomy for benign disease\n [8] :\n\n\n\n\n\nVaginal hysterectomy is the approach of choice whenever feasible.\n\n\n\n\nLaparoscopic hysterectomy is a preferable alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy for those patients in whom a vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or feasible.\n\n\n\n\nThe surgeon should account for clinical factors to determine the best route of hysterectomy for each individual patient.\n\n\n\n\nThe size and shape of the vagina and uterus; accessibility to the uterus (eg, descensus, pelvic adhesions); extent of extrauterine disease; the need for concurrent procedures; surgeon training and experience; average case volume; available hospital technology, devices, and support; whether the case is emergent or scheduled, and patient preference can all influence the route of hysterectomy.\n\n\n\n\nA discussion with the patient should take place on the route of hysterectomy and advantages and disadvantages of each approach.\n\n\n\n\nOpportunistic salpingectomy usually can be safely accomplished at the time of vaginal hysterectomy.\n\n\n\n\nThe role of robotic assistance for execution of laparoscopic hysterectomy has not been clearly determined and more studies are needed to determine clinical use.\n\n\n\nAn algorithm has been proposed by Kovac et al that aids the clinician in choosing the route by which hysterectomy will be performed (see the image below).\n [9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm for selecting route of hysterectomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nIn practice, most vaginal surgeons individualize the choice of a hysterectomy route. Many nulliparous women and many women who have undergone cesarean delivery do in fact have sufficient vaginal capacity to allow a vaginal hysterectomy. As long as the surgeon can obtain adequate access for division of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments, the uterus can be mobilized sufficiently to allow vaginal extraction.\n\nEven when the uterus is enlarged, vaginal hysterectomy often can be accomplished safely by means of morcellation, uterine bisection, wedge debulking, or intramyometrial coring (see Technique).\n [4] \n\nOutcomes\nA Cochrane review found that the vaginal route, compared with all other routes for hysterectomy, yields better outcomes and fewer complications (see the image below).\n [10] The authors also noted that when vaginal hysterectomy is not possible, laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy has advantages over abdominal hysterectomy (eg, faster return to normal activity, shorter hospital stay, reduced intraoperative blood loss, and fewer wound infections) but also disadvantages (eg, longer operating time and higher rate of urinary tract injury).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of vaginal hysterectomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Vaginal Vault Suspension": "\nOverview\n\n\nVaginal prolapse is the herniation of the pelvic organs to or beyond the vaginal walls. It is reported to be the most common reason for hysterectomy in women over age 50 and that a half million procedures are performed for prolapse in the United States annually.\n [1] The number of women with pelvic organ prolapse who are managed without hospitalization and surgery and the number of women with prolapse who never seek medical treatment is not known. Incidence and prevalence estimates based on surgical procedure rates almost certainly underestimate the magnitude of the problem.\nMaintenance of normal vaginal anatomy depends on the interrelationships of intact pelvic floor neuromusculature, ligaments, and fascia. This complex relationship of vaginal support is perhaps least understood at the vaginal apex or vault. Without proper identification and correction of vaginal vault prolapse, surgical correction of the other vaginal compartments is recognized to likely fail. This in part contributes to the 29.2% reoperation rate of women who undergo pelvic floor reconstruction.\n [2] \n\n\nIn a nonhysterectomized woman, the vault, or apex, is located posterior and superior to the cervix (see the image below).

However, these methods are insufficient for adequately assessing many other problems. In these instances, histologic diagnosis is required, and office vulvar biopsy is performed. For example, histologic evaluation should be performed on lesions that may be squamous cell dystrophies, lichen sclerosus, melanoma, or invasive cancer of the vulva. Vulvar lesions (see the image below) that can be diagnosed by vulvar biopsy include molluscum contagiosum, lichen sclerosus, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, condyloma, and vulvar carcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nVulvar lesion to biopsy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVulvar biopsy is one of the more common gynecological office procedures.

Sound application of these concepts is necessary to improve survival, while reducing the adverse effects of mechanical ventilation.\nOver the past 30-40 years, the availability of ventilatory support has led to a substantial improvement in the survival rate for preterm infants. Conventional frequency ventilation is being used on smaller and sicker infants for longer durations.\n\n\nThe primary objective of assisted ventilation is to support breathing until the patient's respiratory efforts are sufficient. Ventilation may be required during immediate care of the infant who is in respiratory failure due to birth depression, encephalopathy,  apnea, shock, or pulmonary disease. Improved survival rates as a result of advances in neonatal care have led to an increased number of infants at risk for chronic lung disease.\nAlthough the etiology of lung injury is multifactorial, animal and clinical data indicate that lung injury is affected, in large part, by the ventilatory strategies used. Optimal ventilatory strategies provide the best possible gas exchange, while minimizing lung injury or other adverse effects. The use of evidence-based ventilatory strategies, strategies to prevent lung injury, and alternative modes of ventilation should yield further improvements in neonatal outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Heel Sticks": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nHeel stick is a minimally invasive and easily accessible way of obtaining capillary blood samples for various laboratory tests, especially newborn screens and glucose levels. However, thanks to improved laboratory techniques that require smaller sample volumes and improved automated heel lancing devices that minimize trauma and pain,\n [1] heel stick is a viable method of obtaining blood for many routine blood tests.\n [2] Heel stick sampling can also help preserve venous access for future intravenous (IV) lines.\n\n\nSome evidence exists that in term neonates, skilled venipuncture may result in fewer total punctures and less pain than heel stick. A Cochrane review first published in 1999 and updated in 2011 suggests that it may in fact be the procedure of choice in this population.\n [3] However, these results may not be extrapolatable to preterm infants or infants who require multiple or frequent blood sampling.\n [4] In addition, the development of newer, more effective, and less painful lancing devices may increase the relative utility of heel stick.\nIndications\nHeel stick blood sampling is indicated whenever capillary blood is an acceptable source. Such situations include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample required is relatively small\n\n\n\n\nAnother acceptable source of blood (eg, central venous catheter, umbilical catheter, arterial line) is not already available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeel stick samples can be used for general chemistries and liver function tests, complete blood counts (CBCs), toxicology, newborn screening, bedside glucose monitoring, and blood gas analysis.\n [5, 6, 7, 8] \n\nContraindications\nHeel stick should not be performed if any significant injury, infection, anomaly, or edema is present on the sampling area of the heel.\n [9] \n\nAt present, coagulation studies may not be performed with capillary samples. Blood tests that require relatively larger sample volumes may not be feasible with heel stick samples. Blood cultures require perfectly sterile technique and, therefore, may not be done with samples obtained via heel stick.

        "Intubation and Tracheal Suctioning for Meconium Aspiration": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nMeconium is a viscous green-black substance that consists of denuded intestinal epithelial cells, ingested lanugo hair, mucus, digestive enzymes, bile acids, and water. The term meconium is derived from the Greek word mekonion, which means poppy juice or opium, presumably either because of its tarry appearance or because of Aristotle's belief that it induced sleep in the fetus.\n\n\nMeconium constitutes the first stool of a newborn infant. The passage of meconium typically occurs within 48 hours after birth; however, it can occur in utero. Postterm fetus may pass the meconium physiologically. Intrauterine meconium passage has been linked to fetal hypoxia and is associated with fetal acidosis, abnormal fetal heart tracings, and low Apgar scores.\n [1] \nIn preterm pregnancies, intrauterine meconium passage has been associated with fetomaternal stress and infection.\n [2] In term and postterm infants without fetal distress, intrauterine meconium passage may result from normal gastrointestinal (GI) maturation or from vagal stimulation caused by head or cord compression.\n [3] Meconium staining of the amniotic fluid occurs in approximately 13% of live births; this percentage increases with increasing gestational age at delivery.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nMeconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) occurs when meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is aspirated into the lungs of an infant before, during, or immediately after birth (see the image below). Intrauterine gasping, resulting in aspiration of meconium, has been demonstrated in animal models exposed to hypoxia.\n [4, 5, 6] MAS occurs in approximately 5% of infants born through MSAF.\n [3] Even with modern neonatal intensive care, mortality from MAS remains high, in the range of 3-5%.\n [1, 7] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPathophysiology of meconium aspiration. Image adapted from Wiswell T, Bent RC. Meconium staining and the meconium aspiration syndrome. Pediatr Clin North Am. 1993;40(5):955-981. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nMany perinatal risk factors have been associated with meconium aspiration, including placental insufficiency, maternal hypertension, maternal diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, and maternal tobacco use.\n [3, 8, 9]  Perhaps the most significant risk factor, however, is postterm delivery. In a prospective clinical study, a decrease in the incidence of MAS from 5.8% to 1.5% over an 8-year period was attributed to a reduction in births at more than 41 weeks' gestation.\n [10] \n\nMAS occurs along a continuum from mild to severe.\n [11] Mild MAS is seen in infants born through MSAF who have mild respiratory symptoms; it probably reflects mild parenchymal irritation from aspirated meconium. Moderate MAS presents with more pronounced pulmonary symptoms, including moderately high oxygen requirements and a possible need for mechanical ventilation; it may reflect a more significant meconium load or the aspiration of thicker meconium into the lungs.\n [11] \n\nInfants with severe MAS require mechanical ventilation with high settings and may need alternative therapies, such as inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and, possibly, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n [12] These cases probably represent a combination of meconium aspiration and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN in these cases is thought to arise from chronic fetal compromise (hypoxia) with resultant pulmonary vascular remodeling.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that chronic in utero hypoxia with resultant PPHN, rather than the aspiration of meconium per se, may be the primary pathologic problem in newborn infants diagnosed with severe MAS.\n [13, 14] \n\nRevised ACOG Recommendations\nSee the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid, regardless of whether they are vigorous or not, should no longer routinely receive intrapartum suctioning. However, meconium0stained amniotic fluid is a condition that requires the notification and availability of an appropriately credentialed team with full resuscitation skills, including endotracheal intubation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Resuscitation should follow the same principles for infants with meconium-stained fluid as for those with clear amniotic fluid.\n         \n\n\n\n          Routine intubation and tracheal suctioning are no longer required.\n         \n\n\n\n          If the infant is vigorous with good respiratory effort and muscle tone, the infant may stay with the mother to receive the initial steps of newborn care.  Gentle clearing of meconium from the mouth and nose with a bulb syringe may be done if necessary.\n         \n\n\n\n          If the infant born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid presents with poor muscle tone and inadequate breathing efforts, the initial steps of resuscitation should be completed under the radiant warmer. Appropriate intervention to support ventilation and oxygenation should be initiated as indicated for each infant and, if the airway is obstructed, this may include intubation and suction.\n         \n\n\nThis new recommendation to no longer routinely suction nonvigorous infants arose from an emphasis on prevention of harm (ie, delays in providing bag-mask ventilation and potential consequences of unnecessary interventions) instead of the unknown benefit of the interventions of routine tracheal intubation and suctioning.\n [15] \n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest practices\n\nSeveral procedures have been used in the past to prevent MAS; none are supported by strong evidence of proven benefit.\n\nSeveral other preventive measures that were commonly used in the past to prevent MAS, including amnioinfusion and intrapartum oronasopharyngeal suctioning, have now been largely abandoned as a result of findings from randomized, controlled trials.\n\nAmnioinfusion involves the infusion of isotonic fluid (either normal saline or lactated Ringer solution) into the amniotic cavity via a transcervical intrauterine pressure catheter in an attempt to dilute the MSAF. The results of previous trials using amnioinfusion to prevent MAS have been mixed. However, given the heterogeneity of the studies and the small number of patients in each study, results must be interpreted with caution.\n [1] \n\nA 2002 Cochrane review concluded that amnioinfusion was effective in reducing the incidence of MAS, especially in centers where perinatal surveillance was limited.\n [16] ; however, a 2010 update of this study found that substantive improvements in perinatal outcome were restricted to settings where facilities for perinatal surveillance are limited.\n [17] In a multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving 1998 women with thick MSAF, amnioinfusion had no significant effect on the incidence of MAS or death.\n [18] \n\nThese findings and the supposition that a large number of infants born through MSAF will have aspirated meconium before amnioinfusion can be performed prompted an ACOG opinion stating that \"routine prophylactic amnioinfusion for the dilution of meconium-stained amniotic fluid should be done only in the setting of additional clinical trials.\"\n [19] In this same statement, however, the ACOG noted that \"amnioinfusion remains a reasonable approach in the treatment of repetitive variable decelerations, regardless of amniotic fluid meconium status.\"\n [19] \n\nIn a randomized controlled trial involving 2514 full-term women with MSAF, Vain et al did not find intrapartum suctioning with a suction catheter to have a beneficial effect on need for endotracheal intubation, incidence of MAS, need for mechanical ventilation, and neonatal mortality.\n [20] The ACOG now recommends that \"infants with MSAF should no longer receive intrapartum suctioning.\n [21] \n\nBecause meconium aspiration can occur before delivery as a consequence of chronic asphyxia and infection, perhaps the most important strategy for preventing MAS is good prenatal care, including the detection and prevention of fetal hypoxemia and the avoidance of postterm deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Neonatal Resuscitation": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nNeonatal resuscitation skills are essential for all health care providers who are involved in the delivery of newborns. The transition from fetus to newborn requires intervention by a skilled individual or team in approximately 10% of all deliveries.\n\n\nThis figure is concerning because 81% of all babies in the United States are born in nonteaching, nonaffiliated level I or II hospitals. In such hospitals, the volume of delivery service may not be perceived as sufficient economic justification for the continuous in-hospital presence of personnel with high-risk delivery room experience, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).\n [1] \nPerinatal asphyxia and extreme prematurity are the 2 complications of pregnancy that most frequently necessitate complex resuscitation by skilled personnel. However, only 60% of asphyxiated newborns can be predicted ante partum. The remaining newborns are not identified until the time of birth. Additionally, approximately 80% of low-birth-weight infants require resuscitation and stabilization at delivery.\n\n\n\n\nNearly one half of newborn deaths (many of which involve extremely premature infants) occur during the first 24 hours after birth. Many of these early deaths also have a component of asphyxia or respiratory depression as an etiology. For the surviving infants, effective management of asphyxia in the first few minutes of life may influence long-term outcome.\n\n\n\n\nEven though prenatal care can identify many potential fetal difficulties ante partum, allowing maternal transfer to the referral center for care, many women who experience preterm labor are not identified prospectively and therefore are not appropriately transferred to a tertiary perinatal center. Consequently, many deliveries of extremely premature infants occur in smaller hospitals.\n\nFor this reason, all personnel involved in delivery room care of the newborn should be trained adequately in all aspects of neonatal resuscitation. Additionally, equipment that is appropriately sized to resuscitate infants of all gestational ages should be available in all delivering institutions, even if the institution does not care for preterm or intensive care infants.\n\nAlong with the necessary skills, the practitioner should approach any resuscitation with a good comprehension of transitional physiology and adaptation, as well as an understanding of the infant's response to resuscitation. Resuscitation involves much more than possessing an ordered list of technical skills and having a resuscitation team; it requires excellent assessment skills and a grounded understanding of physiology.\n\nThis article reviews the adaptation process at delivery, outlines the steps necessary to resuscitate neonates, serves as a review for practitioners who already resuscitate infants, and highlights special problems and controversies. New practitioners must complete the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) or some other program that introduces resuscitation material and allows skill assessment. After reading the material and practicing the skills, they should work with experienced personnel before providing resuscitation at deliveries.\n\nFor patient education resources, see the Public Health Center, as well as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Appendectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nMany early reports described inflammation in and around the appendix, but it was not until 1886 that Reginald Fitz provided an accurate description of the disease process. Fitz was the first to elucidate the clinical history, physical findings, and pathology and was also the first to advocate appendectomy as the cure.\n\n\nIn 1887, Thomas Morton performed the first successful appendectomy in the United States. In 1889, Nicholas Senn was one of the first surgeons to diagnose acute appendicitis correctly, perform an appendectomy, have the patient recover, and report the case. In this same year, Charles McBurney described the clinical findings of acute appendicitis, including the point of maximal tenderness, which still bears his name.\nIndications\nAppendectomy is indicated once the diagnosis of appendicitis or perforated appendicitis has been made. An exception would be a well-localized appendiceal perforation in a child who is clinically well. This presentation allows initial nonoperative treatment with definitive treatment months later with an interval appendectomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nAlmost no contraindications exist to the surgical treatment of appendicitis. It should be kept in mind, however, that certain patients with unrecognized perforated appendicitis may present in a state of florid septic shock. In these patients (and even in those who are not so ill), one must ensure that the patient receives adequate fluid resuscitation and appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics before proceeding to the operating room.\n\nTechnical considerations\nConsiderations to be addressed in planning surgical therapy include the choice between open and laparoscopic appendectomy and the choice between emergency appendectomy and initial conservative management followed by appendectomy some time later.\n\nProcedural planning\nOpen versus laparoscopic appendectomy\n\nLaparoscopic appendectomy is increasingly being favored. Potential advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy include reduced postoperative pain, a lower wound infection rate, a shorter length of stay (–0.6 days), and a faster return to daily activities, including school and gym. After an appropriate learning curve, the difference in operating time between open appendectomy and laparoscopic appendectomy has been shown to be of no statistical significance.\n\nAnother advantage of laparoscopic appendectomy is that it affords the surgeon the ability to evaluate the entire abdomen, which can be useful or diagnostic with adolescent female patients, in whom gynecologic conditions can often imitate appendicitis. Laparoscopic appendectomy is also useful for patients in whom the diagnosis is in question and patients who are obese.\n\nA large retrospective study showed that the technique of appendectomy, open versus laparoscopic, did not appear to affect the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses.\n [1] \n\nEmergency versus interval appendectomy\n\nThe ideal management approach for pediatric patients with a perforated appendix remains controversial. In such cases, the choice is between appendectomy performed emergently and—if the child is clinically well—initial conservative management, with appendectomy at a later date when the acute inflammation has subsided. This delayed surgical treatment is referred to as interval appendectomy and is generally performed 8-12 weeks after the initial episode.\n\nAdvocates of interval appendectomy point to the relatively high rate of recurrent appendicitis without this procedure, the possibility of missed pathologic diagnoses,\n [2] and the low complication rates associated with this approach. Opponents argue that the rate of recurrent disease is insignificant, and they cite concerns about the morbidity associated with interval appendectomy.\n\nSome authors have advocated interval appendectomy only if a fecalith is present on imaging studies, on the grounds that such a finding significantly increases the risk of recurrent disease. Ein et al noted a 72% rate of recurrent appendicitis in patients with a fecalith.\n [3] \n\nWhen a patient undergoes interval appendectomy, the laparoscopic approach is preferred because it enables the surgeon to visualize a wider area of the abdomen, to lyse any postinflammatory adhesions that may be present, and to avoid the need for extending an open incision in case of abnormal anatomy.\n\nThe complication rate for interval appendectomy is reported to be 12-23%, which is less than the 26% complication rate associated with emergent appendectomy in perforated appendicitis. These numbers are based on relatively small studies with different protocols, which limits their usefulness for direct comparison. However, a large meta-analysis did show a significantly greater morbidity for immediate surgery than for conservative treatment with interval appendectomy (35.6% vs 13.5%).\n [4] \n\nA study by Whyte et al suggested that interval laparoscopic appendectomy may be performed as an outpatient procedure.\n [5] In this study, 12 of 24 patients were discharged the evening of the procedure, and of the patients who were admitted, 9 stayed only 1 night. This encouraging report notwithstanding, laparoscopic appendectomy has well-known complications that should not be forgotten, including wound infection, abscess, sepsis, and ileus.\n\nIn a nonblinded randomized comparison of early with interval appendectomy in 131 children with perforated appendicitis, Blakely et al found that early appendectomy significantly reduced the time away from normal activities.\n [6] The overall adverse event rate after early appendectomy was significantly lower than that after interval appendectomy. A prospective randomized study by the same author noted that hospital charges and costs were significantly lower for early appendectomy compared with interval appendectomy.\n [7] \n\nThis area is a popular topic of current research. To date, however, no large-scale prospective randomized trials have compared continued conservative management with interval laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis.\n\nA review of the pediatric literature on the use of interval appendectomy after successful nonoperative treatment of appendiceal mass concluded that despite the lack of prospective studies comparing routine interval appendectomy with nonoperative treatment without interval appendectomy, available data suggest that 80% of children with an appendiceal mass may not need interval appendectomy.\n [8] A prospective study to evaluate the natural history of this condition against the morbidity and costs of interval appendectomy is warranted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Intraosseous Access": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nIn an acute resuscitation situation, after the airway is secured and adequate breathing and gas exchange are established, the next priority is to obtain vascular access. This is often difficult in infants and children. The physiologic processes of shock and hypothermia with resulting vascular constriction, which are often present in a resuscitative situation, may further complicate the problem; furthermore, the skill and experience levels of providers in caring for small children widely vary.\n\n\nIntraosseous (IO) access has been used therapeutically since 1934 and has been proved to be a safe, reliable, and rapid means of introducing crystalloids, colloids, medications, and blood products into the systemic circulation.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] The marrow cavity provides access to a noncollapsible venous plexus as blood flows from the medullary venous sinusoids into the central venous sinus and is then drained into the central venous circulation via nutrient and emissary veins.\nWith the development of the intravenous (IV) catheter, the IO needle fell into disuse. In the 1980s, however, IO access was rediscovered as an immediately available tool in resuscitation situations, when time is of the essence and conditions may be adverse.\n [10, 11] Since then, IO access has become widely accepted in pediatric settings, especially because these patients often provide a particular challenge to obtaining rapid intravascular access.\n\n\n\n\nA retrospective study by Carlson et al found that in 2011, among out-of-hospital critical procedures provided for pediatric patients by emergency medical services in the United States, IO access was one of the most common. Using the National Emergency Medical Services Information System’s national data set, the investigators found that there were 865,591 emergency medical responses that year involving children. Of 616,913 procedures performed (on 246,016 pediatric cases), 11,026 were critical procedures, the most frequently administered being intubation (3599 procedures, or 6.7 per 1000 pediatric cases) and IO access (2618 procedures, or 5 per 1000 pediatric cases).\n [12] \n\n\n\n\nIndications\nInitiation of IO access is indicated in adults, children, infants, or newborns in any clinical situation where vascular access is emergently needed but not immediately available via a peripheral vein. IO access provides a means of administering medications, glucose, and fluids, as well as (potentially) a means of obtaining blood samples. Such a situation would include any resuscitation; cardiopulmonary arrest; shock, regardless of etiology; life-threatening status epilepticus; or lack of venous access resulting from burns, edema, or obesity.\n\nIn comparison with child and infant peripheral IV access, central lines, or umbilical lines, IO access is safer, is associated with fewer complications, can be implemented with less delay, and requires less skill and practice on the part of practitioners who may use the techniques only rarely.\n [13] \n\nIO needle placement does not constitute definitive therapy; rather, it allows the administration of life-saving medications and fluids in a context where intravascular access is vital. Often, definitive IV access is easier to obtain once a bolus of fluids and medications has been administered via the IO needle.\n\nIO needles may be left in place in the marrow for up to 72-96 hours; presumably, the longer the needle remains in place, the greater the risk of infection and dislodgment. In practice, the needle is usually removed as soon as another means of vascular access (either peripheral or central) is available, ideally within 6-12 hours.\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to IO access include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIpsilateral fracture of the extremity, because of resulting extravasation and risk of compartment syndrome\n\n\n\n\nPrevious placement or attempted placement in the same leg or site (eg, sternum), because of consequent extravasation into soft tissue compartments through the previous puncture site\n\n\n\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta, because of the likelihood that puncture of the bone may cause a fracture\n\n\n\n\nOsteopetrosis, because of the risk of fracture\n\n\n\n\nObvious overlying infection at the proposed puncture site, because of the risk of seeding infection (a relative contraindication)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Resuscitation": "\nBackground\n\n\nSince the 1980s, significant advancements have been made in pediatric resuscitation training in the United States. In 1988, the American Heart Association (AHA) offered the first course in Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS). This course was designed for pediatric healthcare providers at all levels and taught basic approaches to pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest with a heavy emphasis on algorithms. In 1984, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) offered the first course in Advanced Pediatric Life Support (APLS). This course was designed to be more comprehensive and covered a spectrum of pediatric emergencies in addition to basic resuscitation. Over the last 20 years, these two programs have become the predominant courses required by hospitals across the United States for pediatric healthcare providers.\nOverall survival to discharge in pediatric patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest varies by age: 17% in adolescents, 13% in children, and 4.9% in infants. Poor outcomes may be attributable in part to the fact that many of these patients do not receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The overall survival in pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests has increased from 9% to 41%. Of those who survive arrests, many suffer permanent brain injury. These improvements are believed to be attributable to earlier recognition and management of critical conditions, earlier CPR, the implementation of medical emergency teams with specialists trained in the acute resuscitation of pediatric patients using the PALS and APLS algorithms, and the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmary resuscitation (ECPR).\n\n\nIn a pediatric resuscitation, understanding the anatomical differences from adults is paramount. They are most pronounced in children younger than 8 years.\nAnatomy\nThe tongue is larger relative to the mouth and has a greater tendency to collapse and obstruct the airway. Tonsils are larger and may bleed with trauma. This makes blind nasotracheal intubation much more difficult in children. The epiglottis is larger, floppier, and more acutely angled, making it more likely to obstruct the view of the vocal cords during intubation. Because of this, a straight blade may be required. The larynx is higher, relative to adults. It is at C1 in infants, C3 in toddlers, and C6 in adults. It is also more anterior and more likely to collapse on inspiration. Avoid hyperextension of the neck and use a straight blade to help visualize the anatomy. The narrowest point of the airway in a child younger than 8 years is the cricoid cartilage, not the subglottic area. This makes correct tube size more important, especially if using an uncuffed tube. An infant's occiput is larger than an adult. For children younger than 2 years, a roll under the shoulders helps properly position theairway.For children older than 2 years, place a roll under the head to improve the view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPulses in an infant younger than 1 year should be palpated at the brachial artery on the medial aspect of the upper arm. For children older than 1 year, the neck should be long enough that the most accessible central artery will be the carotid. Infants have a lower functional residual capacity and higher oxygen consumption per minute giving them a greater tendency to become hypoxic.\n\nIn cases of airway edema, noxious stimuli may precipitate a respiratory arrest in a tenuous child. Keeping the child calm is extremely important in this situation. Because of their higher vagal tone, children are more prone to bradycardia with airway manipulation. Atropine may help blunt this effect (see Medications).\n\nNormal vital signs vary by age. Basic guidelines are below.\n [1] \n\nHeart rate\nNormal ranges for heart rate are as follows\n\n\n\n\n\nNeonate: 90-205 beats per minute (BPM)\n\n\n\n\n1 week to 1 month: 90-180 BPM\n\n\n\n\n3 month to 2 years: 80-150 BPM\n\n\n\n\n2-10 years: 60-120 BPM\n\n\n\n\n10 years to adult: 50-100 BPM\n\n\n\nRespiratory rate\nNormal ranges for respiratory rate are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm infant: 30-50 breaths per minute (BPM)\n\n\n\n\n1 -6 months: 20-40 BPM\n\n\n\n\n6 months to 2 years: 20-30 BPM\n\n\n\n\n2-12 years: 16-24 BPM\n\n\n\n\nAdolescents: 12-20 BPM\n\n\n\nBlood pressure\nIn children who require resuscitation, blood pressure may be normal. If the child appears ill, fluids and medications should not be delayed because the blood pressure remains normal. Hypotension in a child is often a sign of decompensated shock and reason for swift intervention. For the 2020 PALS guidelines, hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure (note that these thresholds will overlap with normal values, including those of children who have systolic blood pressure lower than the 5th percentile for age):\n\n\n\n\n\n< 60 mm Hg in term newborns > 3kg (0-28 d), < 40 in Hg in preterm newborns < 1 kg\n\n\n\n\n< 70 mm Hg in infants (1-12 mo)\n\n\n\n\n< 70 mm Hg + (2 × age in years) in children 1-10 years\n\n\n\n\n< 90 mm Hg in children ≥10 years\n\n\n\nPediatric resuscitation is a broad topic.

        "Pediatric Sedation": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nProcedural sedation may be defined as the administration of sedative or dissociative agents, with or without analgesics, to induce a state that allows the patient to tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining cardiorespiratory function. Specifically, the drugs, doses, and techniques used are not likely to produce a loss of protective airway reflexes.\nIndications for emergency department sedation\nThe function of sedation is management of anxiety, pain, and control of excessive motion. Diagnostic procedures for which emergency department (ED) sedation may be indicated include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nLumbar puncture\n\n\n\n\nArthrocentesis\n\n\n\n\nBone marrow biopsy\n\n\n\n\nSexual assault examination\n\n\n\n\nRadiologic evaluation (CT, MRI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapeutic procedures for which ED sedation may be indicated include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSuturing\n\n\n\n\nWound care\n\n\n\n\nAbscess incision and drainage\n\n\n\n\nFracture reduction\n\n\n\n\nDislocation\n\n\n\n\nForeign body removal\n\n\n\n\nBurn debridement\n\n\n\n\nTube thoracostomy\n\n\n\n\nAny other painful procedure\n\n\n\n\nMultiple procedures (eg, IV line placement and urethral catheterization)\n [1] \n\n\nSafety considerations\nDiscussion about the risks, benefits, and alternatives with the parent or guardian is necessary before initiation of procedural sedation. The need for written consent may be determined by an institutional, local, or state mandate.\n\n\n\n\nChildren of all ages should be NPO for clear liquids 2 hours before undergoing sedation. Recommendations for duration of NPO for solid food and nonclear liquids (eg, infant formula, milk) vary by age, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n< 6 months: 4-6 hours\n\n\n\n\n6-36 months: 6 hours\n\n\n\n\n>36 months: 6-8 hours\n\n\n\nSuction and airway equipment should be at the bedside and ready to use if necessary. Equipment should include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn appropriately sized positive-pressure oxygen delivery system\n\n\n\n\nSuction apparatus\n\n\n\n\nSuction catheters (eg, tonsil, Yankauer)\n\n\n\nThe following equipment should be readily available:\n\n\n\n\n\nAge-appropriate equipment for measuring blood pressure and oxygen saturation\n\n\n\n\nA crash cart with age-appropriate drugs and equipment\n\n\n\nPreprocedural evaluation\nImportant elements of the history are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nPast medical history, especially with respect to previous sedation or anesthesia\n\n\n\n\nLast solid and liquid oral intake\n\n\n\n\nRecent illness\n\n\n\n\nMedication or drug use\n\n\n\n\nAllergies or adverse reaction\n\n\n\n\nPertinent family history\n\n\n\n\nPregnancy status (for postmenarchal females)\n\n\n\n\nUpper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms; history of reactive airway disease\n\n\n\nElements of the physical examination are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\n\n\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nVital signs\n\n\n\n\nAirway examination (head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat [HEENT] and pulmonary examination)\n\n\n\n\nCardiovascular examination\n\n\n\n\nNeurologic/mental status\n\n\n\n\nSize and location of injury and neurologic status distal to it\n\n\n\nThe physical examination focuses on the airway, especially for anatomic variations. The use of the Mallampati classification for assessment helps identify patients in whom airway management is likely to prove difficult (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallampati classification. \n\n\nIntraprocedural monitoring\nMonitoring during procedural sedation usually should include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintain continuous oxygen saturation and heart rate monitoring\n\n\n\n\nRecord vital signs and blood pressure every 15 minutes for conscious sedation and every 5 minutes for deep sedation\n\n\n\n\nRecord drug dose and time administered\n\n\n\n\nRecord state of consciousness and response to stimulation\n\n\n\n\nConsider end-tidal CO2 monitoring\n\n\n\n\nConsider capnography and bispectral index monitoring for patients in the operating room\n\n\n\nSedative medications and reversal agents\nMedications for procedural sedation include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nOpioid analgesics – Morphine sulfate, fentanyl\n\n\n\n\nBenzodiazepines – Midazolam, diazepam\n\n\n\n\nBarbiturates – Pentobarbital, methohexital, thiopental\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous agents – Nitrous oxide, ketamine, propofol, dexmedetomidine\n\n\n\nAlthough the medication dose is calculated based on weight, the response can vary significantly from one child to the next. Appropriate actions include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider starting with the lowest recommended dose (or even half that) and titrate as needed\n\n\n\n\nKeep reversal agents, when available, at the bedside, and double-check their proper doses\n\n\n\nReversal agents include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nOpioids – Naloxone\n\n\n\n\nBenzodiazepines - Flumazenil\n\n\n\nPostprocedural care\nAfter the completion of the procedure, keep recording vital signs until the patient responds appropriately to a voice or gentle stimulation. Sedation is stimulus-dependent; accordingly, when the procedure is completed, the child is likely to become more sedated than during the procedure, which can lead to hypoventilation and hypoxia.\n\nIn general, discharge criteria should include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe child’s vital signs should be within 15% of admission readings (either above or below)\n\n\n\n\nThe child should be ambulatory as appropriate for his or her age, without assistance\n\n\n\n\nThe child should be able to ingest and retain oral fluids\n\n\n\nSome agents are associated with specific aftercare needs. For example, ketamine may cause ataxia for 12-24 hours, and the child’s activities should be restricted during this period to prevent further injury.\n\nGuidelines\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) have issued updated clinical guidelines on the monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\n\nThe guidelines include the following\n [2, 3] :   \n\n\n\n\n\n          Practitioners who administer moderate sedation need to have the skills to rescue a child with apnea, laryngospasm and airway obstruction, and to perform successful bag/mask ventilation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Those administering deep sedation also must be able to perform tracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Additionally, the skilled observer for either moderate or deep sedation must be trained in Pediatric Advanced Life Support.\n         \n\n\n\n          The use of capnography is highly encouraged for children who are moderately sedated and required for those who are deeply sedated.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Septic Arthritis Surgery": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nSeptic arthritis in infancy and childhood is a true clinical emergency (see image below). Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis can result in disastrous complications, including complete destruction of the articular cartilage and the underlying epiphysis, loss of the adjacent growth plate, and dislocation of the joint. With prompt treatment, the condition may be cured and sequelae avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency department photograph of infant with septic arthritis of left hip. Child holds hip rigidly in classic position of flexion, abduction, and external rotation, a position that maximizes capsular volume. Patient is relatively comfortable as long as hip joint remains immobile in this position. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nThe clinician must be alert to a diagnosis that can be subtle, particularly in the young child or infant. The clinical presentations of other conditions can closely mimic that of septic arthritis.\n [1, 2, 3] Pain with passive motion is the most consistent finding in septic arthritis, and the diagnosis must be considered in any joint with this presentation. An aggressive workup is indicated whenever signs and symptoms suggest septic arthritis. This evaluation must include blood cultures and joint aspiration.\n\n\n\n\nBefore the advent of antibiotics, the consequences of septic arthritis were usually severe and often fatal. Surgical drainage was the only treatment available. With the development of effective antibiotics, it became possible to cure septic arthritis, but, except in a very few select situations, surgical drainage must still be performed. The most recent change in the prevention and treatment of septic arthritis has occurred with the institution of routine immunizations against Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, the clinical signs of septic arthritis are prominent, but the clinician fails to obtain pus by aspiration. Decision-making in these situations should be analogous to that used in the management of an acute abdomen. The risks of an unnecessary arthrotomy are minimal compared with the certainty of permanent joint damage that accompanies a neglected septic arthritis.\n\nThe chief concern with septic arthritis in childhood and infancy is the potential for severe complications. The condition must be expeditiously diagnosed and appropriate treatment begun without delay. The diagnosis must be considered whenever painful joint dysfunction is present.\n\nFor patient education resources, see the Arthritis Center and the Bacterial and Viral Infections Center, as well as Gonorrhea and Knee Pain.\n\nSeptic arthritis vs transient synovitis\nOf all the conditions that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of septic arthritis, transient synovitis is the most common.\n\nKocher et al identified 4 independent multivariate clinical predictors that may be useful in differentiating septic arthritis from transient synovitis: a history of fever, an inability to bear weight, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 40 mm/hr or more, and a serum white blood cell (WBC) count higher than 12,000/µL.\n [5] Using these 4 predictors, they found that the incidence of septic arthritis was 0.2% for no predictors, 3.0% for 1, 40.0% for 2, 93.1% for 3, and 99.6% for all 4 predictors.\n\nIndications\nA septic joint should be considered a closed abscess, and antibiotic treatment alone should not be expected to resolve the infection. In addition to administration of medical therapy, the joint must be adequately drained.\n\nPatients may be treated with antibiotics and repeated joint aspiration in cases of involvement of an easily accessible peripheral joint; a clinical course shorter than 6 days; and no evidence of an associated osteomyelitis, immune deficiency, or other chronic illness. If the patient’s condition fails to improve, open drainage is the next approach. Peripheral joints may be adequately drained with arthroscopy if the technology is available.\n\nOpen drainage is definitely indicated in the hip and the shoulder and in peripheral joints that do not respond to percutaneous aspiration. Open drainage is indicated in patients who are systemically ill, and it should be given greater consideration when the suspected organism is Staphylococcus aureus or a gram-negative bacterium that produces cartilage-damaging enzymes.\n [6] \n\nGonococcal arthritis is less likely to rapidly damage a joint, and these infections may be managed with repeated aspirations if the joints involved are peripheral. Open drainage should still be performed in cases of gonococcal arthritis of the hip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Tracheostomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nAsclepiades is said to have performed the first tracheostomy in 100 BC. In the 19th century, tracheostomy was first widely used in the treatment of diphtheria in children, and by 1887, approximately 20,000 of these operations had been reported in Western Europe and the United States.\n\n\nThe scope of the procedure broadened when Galloway reported using the procedure for the respiratory care of patients with poliomyelitis. It was the epidemic of poliomyelitis in the early 1950s that stimulated the use of tracheostomy for positive-pressure ventilation, and this opened the doors for similar treatment in tetanus, cardiac surgery, severe burns, and the care of preterm infants.\n [1, 2] \nThe incidence of and indications for pediatric tracheostomy have changed over years. Upper airway obstruction secondary to infectious disorders was once the most common indication for tracheostomy.\n [3] Currently, however, the most common indication for pediatric tracheostomy is prolonged ventilation necessitated by neuromuscular or respiratory problems.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nThe old dictum that tracheostomy should be performed as soon as it comes to mind may not hold true now. This article outlines the indications for and performance of tracheostomy in children. It should be kept in mind that the indications and the timing may vary, depending on the facilities available in the institution where the patient is admitted, the comfort level of the medical team in postponing the tracheostomy, and the expertise of the individual surgeon in performing the surgery.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nVaccination programs, improvements in material engineering, and anesthetic skills have dramatically reduced the number of emergency tracheostomies performed for acute upper airway obstruction. Today, the main indications for tracheostomy in a child generally involves either (1) anticipated long-term cardiorespiratory compromise resulting from chronic ventilatory (or, rarely, cardiac) insufficiency or (2) the presence of a fixed upper airway obstruction that is unlikely to resolve for a significant period of time.\n [5, 6, 7, 8] \n\nIn one series, subglottic stenosis (31.4%), bilateral vocal cord paralysis (22.2%), congenital airway malformations (22.2%), and tumors (11.1%) were the most common conditions that necessitated pediatric tracheostomy.\n [9] Conditions that have increased the frequency of pediatric tracheostomy over the past decade include respiratory papillomatosis, caustic alkali ingestion, and craniofacial syndromes. Conditions in which tracheostomy are now used less frequently include subglottic hemangioma and laryngeal clefts.\n [4] \n\nContraindications\nA tracheostomy is contraindicated during surgical repair of a type IV laryngotracheoesophageal cleft, because it may erode the posterior suture line and result in a breakdown of the repair. It is preferable to managing the airway with a nasotracheal or orotracheal tube during the postoperative period with the child kept paralyzed, although many children ultimately require tracheostomy when the repair is soundly healed because of tracheomalacia, which prevents extubation.\n [10] \n\nTechnical Considerations\nPerforming a tracheostomy is difficult in pediatric patients, because a child's neck is anatomically different from an adult's neck in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dome of the pleura extends into the neck and is thus vulnerable to injury\n\n\n\n\nThe trachea is pliable and can be difficult to palpate\n\n\n\n\nThe trachea can be easily retracted to a great extent with little pull, and care must be taken distinguish it from the carotid vessels\n\n\n\n\nThe neck is short, and there is significantly less working space\n\n\n\n\nThe cricoid can be injured if it is not correctly identified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Phototherapy for Jaundice": "\nBackground\n\n\nJaundice refers to the yellow appearance of the skin that occurs with the deposition of bilirubin in the dermal and subcutaneous tissue. Normally in the body, bilirubin is processed through the liver, where it is conjugated to glucuronic acid by the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UGT) 1A1. This conjugated form of bilirubin is then excreted into the bile and removed from the body via the gut. When this excretion process is low following birth, does not work efficiently, or is overwhelmed by the amount of endogenously produced bilirubin, the amount of bilirubin in the body increases, resulting in hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice.\nJaundice occurs in as many as 60% of all normal newborns within the first week of life.\n [1] Jaundice in the newborn can occur from an underlying pathological condition, such as isoimmune hemolysis or an RBC enzyme deficiency. However, it is more commonly due to the normal physiological inability of the newborn infant to process bilirubin adequately due to the combined effects of increased RBC turnover and a transient deficit in bilirubin conjugation in the liver.\n [1] This type of nonpathologic jaundice is referred to as physiologic jaundice of the newborn.\n [2] \n\n\nIn most infants with physiologic jaundice, bilirubin concentrations do not rise to a point that requires treatment. However, in some infants with exaggerated physiologic jaundice, and in many infants with pathologic jaundice, bilirubin in the blood reaches very high concentrations that put the infant at risk for acute and chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus). In these cases, treatment aimed at decreasing bilirubin concentration is required in order to avoid kernicterus. Etiologies of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns are provided in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\nCauses of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants. Adapted from Maisel MJ. Neonatal Jaundice. Pediatrics in Review. 2006; 27: p. 445. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective treatments to decrease bilirubin levels in infants with severe jaundice include phototherapy and exchange transfusion.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of light on jaundice in neonates, and the ability of light to decrease serum bilirubin levels, was first described by Cremer et al in 1958.\n [3] This observation led to the development of light sources for use in the treatment of infants with hyperbilirubinemia, a treatment now referred to as phototherapy. Since its inception, phototherapy has been effectively used as a relatively inexpensive and noninvasive method of treating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.\n [4, 5] The decline in the number or exchange transfusions in recent years is, at least in part, likely a direct reflection of the effectiveness of phototherapy at treating hyperbilirubinemia. In modern neonatal ICUs (NICUs) exchange transfusions are rare and are only used as a rescue therapy to avoid kernicterus in newborns with severe jaundice when phototherapy is inadequate.\n\nAt its most basic, phototherapy refers to the use of light to convert bilirubin molecules in the body into water soluble isomers that can be excreted by the body. The absorption of light by normal bilirubin (4Z,15Z-bilirubin) results in the creation of 2 isomeric forms of bilirubin: structural isomers and configurational isomers. The main structural isomer of bilirubin is Z-lumirubin. The main configurational isomer of bilirubin is 4Z,15 E -bilirubin. Configurational isomerization is reversible, and structural isomerization is irreversible. Both the configurational and structural isomers of bilirubin are less lipophilic than normal bilirubin and can be excreted into bile without undergoing glucuronidation in the liver. Some of the configurational isomers of bilirubin, however, revert back to the native form after excretion into bile and can be reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation in the gut. Structural bilirubin isomers, like Z-lumirubin, can also be excreted in the urine.\n\nThe absorptions of light by bilirubin also results in the generation of excited-state bilirubin molecules that react with oxygen to produce colorless oxidation products, or photooxidation products. This process occurs more slowly than configurational or structural isomerization. Photooxidation products are primarily excreted in the urine. The image below provides a schematic of the conversion of normal bilirubin to configurational isomers, structural isomers, and photooxidation products and the respective routes of excretion from the body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanism of phototherapy: Blue-green light in the range of 460-490 nm is most effective for phototherapy. The absorption of light by the normal bilirubin (4Z,15Z-bilirubin) generates configuration isomers, structural isomers, and photooxidation products. The 2 principal photoisomers formed in humans are shown. Configurational isomerization is reversible and much faster than structural isomerization. Structural isomerization is slow and irreversible. Photooxidation occurs more slowly than both configurational and structural isomerization. Photooxidation products are excreted mainly in urine. Adapted from Maisel MJ, McDonagh AD.

        "Surgical Aspects of Cystic Fibrosis and Meconium Ileus": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nMeconium ileus is among the most common causes of intestinal obstruction in the newborn, accounting for 9-33% of neonatal intestinal obstructions. It is the earliest clinical manifestation of cystic fibrosis (CF) and occurs in either a simple or a complicated form in approximately 16-20% of patients who have CF, though it also occurs in patients who do not have CF.\n\n\nIn the simple form, thickened meconium begins to form in utero. It obstructs the midileum, causing proximal dilatation, bowel wall thickening, and congestion. Complicated meconium ileus may cause volvulus, atresia, necrosis, perforation, meconium peritonitis, and pseudocyst formation.\nClinically, CF is characterized by the following triad:\n\n\n\n\n\nChronic obstruction and infection of the respiratory tract\n\n\n\n\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency\n\n\n\n\nElevated sweat chloride levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA possible meconium ileus diagnosis should raise the suspicion of CF in the fetus. Antenatal diagnosis of meconium ileus can be confirmed in 2 groups. In the low-risk group, the diagnosis is suspected when routine prenatal ultrasonography reveals the sonographic appearances of meconium ileus. The high-risk group consists of all pregnancies subsequent to the birth of a child with CF. Parents of a child with CF are obligate carriers of a CF mutation.\n\nGo to Cystic Fibrosis and Sinonasal Manifestations of Cystic Fibrosis for complete information on these topics.\n\nPathophysiology\nFetuses with CF have abnormal development of the pancreas and intestinal tract. Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) can be detected in the pancreatic ductules at 18 weeks’ gestation. In patients with CF, abnormal pancreatic secretions obstruct the duct system, leading to autodigestion of the acinar cells, fatty replacement, and ultimately, fibrosis. Beginning in utero, this progressive process occurs variably over time.\n\nApproximately two thirds of infants later diagnosed with CF by neonatal screening have pancreatic insufficiency at birth. Approximately 10% of patients with CF remain pancreatic sufficient and tend to have a milder course.\n\nIndications\nSurgical exploration is indicated for patients with progressive distention, signs of peritonitis, or clinical deterioration. Surgery is always indicated for complicated meconium ileus. Complicated meconium ileus requires resection more often than simple meconium ileus and always requires temporary stomas.\n\nThe following complications necessitate surgical management:\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistent or worsening abdominal distension\n\n\n\n\nPersistent bowel obstruction\n\n\n\n\nEnlarging abdominal mass\n\n\n\n\nIntestinal atresia\n\n\n\n\nVolvulus\n\n\n\n\nPerforation\n\n\n\n\nMeconium cyst formation with peritonitis\n\n\n\n\nBowel necrosis\n\n\n\nConditions associated with cystic fibrosis and meconium ileus\nComplicated meconium ileus may cause volvulus, atresia, necrosis, perforation, meconium peritonitis, and pseudocyst formation. Infants with meconium ileus are at risk for cholestasis, particularly if they have received or are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Monitor alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels weekly. An observational study of infants with CF and meconium ileus identified the following risk factors for poor outcomes: high blood immunoreactive trypsinogen levels, prenatally diagnosed intestinal obstruction, a severe post-surgical clinical picture, and early liver disease.\n [1] \n\nGastroesophageal reflux\nGastroesophageal reflux (GER) is more prevalent in patients with CF, and it may exacerbate the respiratory status of the patient with CF. Pathologic reflux (ie, endoscopic and histologic esophagitis) is present in more than 50% of patients with CF. Most CF patients have an abnormal quantity of reflux as defined by pH probe, and it has been reported with prominent respiratory symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of this condition are of prime importance if the complications of pathologic reflux are to be curtailed and respiratory function maximized.\n\nThe particular mechanism of GER in CF is unclear, but a number of factors may contribute to the increased susceptibility of this patient group to the development of pathologic GER.\n\nFirst, most reflux episodes in CF occur during transient lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxations. These transient relaxations are increased during distension of the gastric fundus, a feature that can predispose these patients to reflux especially when receiving large supplemental bolus feeds. This cycle of events may be further exacerbated in the event of poor gastric emptying. Gastric emptying of liquids was initially thought to be delayed in patients with CF.\n\nSecond, the head-down posture adopted during chest physiotherapy places gastric liquid content in an optimum position at the LES for reflux in the event of a transient period of relaxation. Associated coughing and forced expiration, which both increase the abdominothoracic pressure gradient, also facilitates reflux action.\n\nLast, medications such as theophylline and beta-adrenergic drugs, used in the treatment of respiratory disease in patients with CF, are known to decrease the resting tone in the LES and could conceivably facilitate reflux activity.\n\nBiliary tract disease\nBiliary tract disease is another important consideration. Gallbladder disease is prevalent in the CF population, with abnormal oral cholecystograms in 46% and cholelithiasis in 12%. Abnormalities described in patients with CF include a microgallbladder containing thick colorless “white bile” with occlusion of the cystic duct, gallstones, biliary dyskinesia, and sclerosing cholangitis.\n\nBile acid metabolism is disturbed in patients with pancreatic insufficiency who are not receiving adequate pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Bile acids are likely bound to malabsorbed fat and, as a result, are lost in feces, which in turn depletes the bile acid pool and supersaturates cholesterol in the gallbladder. This condition promotes stone formation.\n\nMany patients with CF and gallbladder sludge or stones are asymptomatic, but approximately 4% have the classic symptomatology of cholecystitis. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice in such cases because postoperative pain and therefore pulmonary compromise are less with this technique than with the classic open technique. The role of cholecystectomy in patients with asymptomatic gallstones remains unclear.\n\nDistal intestinal obstruction\nDistal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), also referred to as meconium ileus equivalent, is a recurrent postneonatal partial or complete intestinal obstruction unique to patients with CF. Most cases occur in adolescents and adults, but all age groups can be affected, with an overall incidence of approximately 15%.\n [2] \n\nThe exact etiology of DIOS is unknown, but these patients are more likely to have a history of steatorrhea from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency despite adequate enzyme therapy. One study also showed that, of 27 patients with DIOS, 17 (63%) had a history of meconium ileus as an infant.\n\nA number of aspects peculiar to the gastrointestinal (GI) function of CF patients may help, in part, to explain this syndrome. These include abnormal intestinal mucins, abnormal intraluminal water and electrolyte content, and inherently slow intestinal motility. The latter may be because neurotensin, a GI hormone that delays motility, is secreted from the distal ileum when unabsorbed fat reaches that location. Additional precipitating factors may include relative dehydration, especially in a postoperative period, inadequate enzyme supplementation, and changes in diet.\n\nThe cardinal features of DIOS are cramping abdominal pain, often localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), a palpable mass in the RLQ, and decreased frequency of defecation. Different degrees of obstruction are present, from partial, which is most common, to complete with vomiting, distension, and absolute constipation. Colicky pain may be provoked by meals, which may then result in anorexia as a method to avoid further pain.\n\nPhysical examination in uncomplicated DIOS usually reveals a tender mass in the RLQ with no evidence of peritonitis. No fecal impaction or dehydrated stool is noted on rectal examination, and the stool is heme negative.\n\nThe nonspecific nature of DIOS, with no pathognomonic radiologic features, means that an accurate diagnosis of abdominal pain in the patient with CF is not easy. Plain supine and erect abdominal radiography is still, however, the most helpful initial investigation when the diagnosis is suspected. This shows bubbly granular material in the right iliac fossa and variable degrees of small-bowel obstruction, ie, air-fluid levels with proximal small-bowel dilatation. Plain radiography supports, but does not prove, the diagnosis.\n\nInspissated material in the right iliac fossa can also be demonstrated with a water-soluble contrast enema. In doing so, intussusception can be excluded, and the investigation itself may prove therapeutic in some cases of DIOS.\n\nParticular difficulty is faced in the event of partial small-bowel obstruction caused by adhesions from previous abdominal surgery or appendiceal disease, which occurs in 1.5-2% of patients with CF (a lower incidence than the 8.6% noted in the general population).\n\nAbdominal pain is a common symptom in patients with CF, and, because these patients are often already being treated with antibiotics and steroids, the classic clinical signs and symptoms of appendicitis may be masked and the critical diagnosis missed. This results in a high incidence of perforation and substantial morbidity in this patient group. Despite the blunting of clinical signs, evidence of pyrexia and a leukocytosis may still be present.\n\nDepending on the appendix location, a contrast enema may show deformity of the cecum with an associated mass effect and not the typical inspissated material features of DIOS. Abdominal ultrasonography or, if necessary, computed tomography (CT) scanning shows free fluid or an abscess collection in the region of the cecum. In such cases, treatment should then proceed with appendectomy. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, the surgeon could opt to start with a laparoscopic investigation and then proceed appropriately in light of the findings.\n\nIn the absence of partial small-bowel obstruction due to adhesions, appendiceal disease, or complete obstruction, DIOS is suitable for a trial of medical management. After adequate rehydration, a balanced polyethylene glycol–electrolyte solution may be administered orally or via nasogastric tube. The dosage is 20-40 mL/kg/h with a maximum of 1200 mL/h. Prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide, can be used to limit the amount of nausea and bloating.\n\nSuccessful treatment is judged by the passage of stool, resolution of symptoms, and the disappearance of a previously palpable right iliac fossa mass. Sequential plain abdominal radiography helps to document the resolution of DIOS, but, if symptoms persist, the differential diagnoses already outlined must be reconsidered.\n\nThe use of enemas at the diagnostic stage is outlined. Contrast enemas should also be used for patients with emesis due to DIOS after placement of a nasogastric tube for gastric suction. As long as the patient remains clinically stable, the contrast enemas may be repeated at intervals of several hours over several days. However, careful monitoring of the patient must be initiated before, during, and after the procedure because large fluid and electrolyte shifts can be induced by the contrast material.\n\nWhen complete obstruction or evidence of peritonitis is present, surgical intervention is necessary and all oral or rectal therapies are contraindicated. A nasogastric tube should be passed to help with decompression, and adequate resuscitative measures should be initiated. At laparotomy, the bowel wall feels thickened and filled with tenacious material. It can be decompressed and irrigated with diatrizoate meglumine, usually via a small catheter placed through the appendix stump. An irrigating tube may also be left in situ for postoperative bowel irrigation.\n\nGastrointestinal neoplasms\nThe overall risk of cancer in patients with CF is similar to that of the general population; however, risk of gastrointestinal neoplasms is increased. These include tumors of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver or biliary tract, and pancreas.\n\nThe differential localization and expression of CFTR may play a role in the neoplastic disease process. Furthermore, increased cellular turnover in response to the persistent irritation of GER, gallstones, or steatorrhea in digestive tract organs may also offer an explanation to these findings.\n\nFibrosing colonopathy\nFibrosing colonopathy is a newly described entity in children with CF. A longitudinal study showed that, of the children with CF who developed fibrosing colonopathy, 89% (8) of patients underwent surgery, and 63% (5) of them received a subtotal colectomy. Findings at laparotomy in children with CF who presented with presumed DIOS that did not respond to medical therapy included colonic strictures with histopathological changes of postischemic ulceration repair, with mucosal and submucosal fibrosis, destruction of the muscularis mucosa, and eosinophilia.\n\nIn some patients, a change from conventional enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes to high-strength products 12-15 months before presentation has been described.\n\nThe diagnosis of fibrosing colonopathy should be considered in patients with CF who have been exposed to high doses of pancreatic enzymes and present with symptoms of abdominal pain, distension, chylous ascites, change in bowel habit, or failure to thrive. Continued diarrhea may also be a prominent feature, which unfortunately may prompt the family to increase supplemental enzymes further. On occasion, the diarrhea may be bloody.\n\nA barium enema may reveal mucosal irregularity, loss of haustral markings with a foreshortened colon with varying degrees of stricture formation. In some cases, the whole colon has been involved. Colonoscopy may show an erythematous mucosa and areas of narrowing, from which taking multiple forceps-pinch biopsies is advisable.\n\nInitial management should reduce enzyme dosage to the recommended levels of 500-2500 lipase units/kg per meal. This should be accompanied with adequate nutritional supplementation, which may be enteral elemental feeding or even TPN for a time. Those patients who show signs of unrelenting failure to thrive, obstruction, uncontrollable diarrhea, or chylous ascites then need surgical intervention.\n\nWhen elective surgery is planned for patients with intractable symptoms, gentle bowel preparation can be administered preoperatively. The aim of surgical intervention is to resect the affected bowel and make a primary anastomosis. Unfortunately, this is not possible in the event of pancolonic or rectal involvement, and, as a result, the patient requires an ostomy. This is often the safest option; patients and parents must be fully aware and prepared for it preoperatively.\n\nWhether this condition completely resolves with a reduction in enzyme dosage and surgical resection is unclear, so the operated group also requires regular follow-up for any signs of deterioration.\n\nRectal prolapse\nRectal prolapse occurs in approximately 20-23% of patients with CF. The initial prolapse occurs most commonly in patients aged 1-3 years and can be recurrent in nature. It may also be the sole presenting feature of a new patient with CF in about 4-8% of all cases.\n\nFactors that directly predispose this group to prolapse include constipation, diarrhea with increased frequency and volume of movement, malabsorption, and colonic distention. Indirect contributors relate to increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by coughing or pulmonary hyperinflation.\n\nInitial management involves manually reducing the prolapse. Medical management to maximize fat absorption then aids the overall control. Reassure parents that the number of prolapse episodes is likely to reduce with age. However, further intervention is warranted in a small group when they have persistent pain or incontinence with each episode of prolapse.\n\nThe acute prolapse is easily reduced if action is taken promptly before edema formation. Parents can be taught to grasp the herniated bowel with the fingertips of a gloved hand and apply circumferential pressure with an inward push. Sustained pressure may be required to achieve full reduction. If prolapse immediately recurs, then the buttocks can be strapped together with adhesive tape for 7-14 days.\n\nRecurrent prolapse can be treated by means of a rectal submucosal injection, performed with general anesthesia after the rectum has been emptied with a suppository. With the patient in the lithotomy position, the needle is inserted through the skin just outside the mucocutaneous junction and guided into position by a finger placed in the rectum. As the needle is slowly withdrawn, 2-3 mL of 5% phenol in almond oil or hypertonic sodium chloride solution (30%) is injected in a linear track into 4 different quadrants.\n\nA single treatment controls approximately 90% of cases. Linear electrocauterization in the 4 quadrants has also been described to produce a perirectal inflammation. This technique requires a longer hospital stay and may be complicated by rectal bleeding and/or rectal stenosis.\n\nWhen all conservative options are exhausted, a surgical approach may then be considered. However, many different operations have been described to control rectal prolapse. Through a transabdominal approach, the rectum can be fixed to the hollow of the sacrum by a prosthetic or fascia lata graft sutured to the bowel and the presacral fascia, thus creating a new pelvic floor.\n\nOther operations include rectal suspension and levator ani muscle repair through a posterior sagittal approach. The diversity of options highlights the unsatisfactory results often achieved in these difficult cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n"

        "Alar Rim Retraction Rhinoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nAnatomic deformities can affect both the aesthetic and functional qualities of the nose.\n [1, 2] Alar retraction and alar-columellar disproportion can be considered an aesthetic deformity in the context of prerhinoplasty analysis. Retraction can also suggest nasal valve weakness or scarring due to previous surgery. In cases of nasal valve instability, a flail alar sidewall or intranasal scarring may compromise the patient’s breathing.\n [3] \n\n\nAlar rim retraction (or notching) is one of the most common complications of primary and secondary rhinoplasty.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Alar rim retraction can also occur in the patient without previous nasal surgery. Alar rim retraction is typically due to arching, malpositioning, or surgical weakening of the lateral crura.\nThe prevalence of alar rim retraction is difficult to assess. The condition is more common in patients with previous rhinoplasty or nasal sidewall cutaneous surgery history.\n\n\n\n\nIndications\nIndications for the surgical correction of alar rim retraction include aesthetic deformity, patient request for a change in nasal shape, and improvement of anatomic nasal airway obstruction.\n\n\n\n\nContraindications\nAlar rim rhinoplasty contraindications mirror those that apply to rhinoplasty in general, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nUnstable mental status (eg, unstable patient with schizophrenia)\n\n\n\n\nUnrealistic patient expectations\n\n\n\n\nRhinoplasty within the last 9-12 months (applies only to major rhinoplasties)\n\n\n\n\nPoor perioperative health risk profile\n\n\n\n\nAn atrophic skin or soft tissue envelope and significant scarring due to too many rhinoplasties\n\n\n\n\nOngoing relapsing polychondritis\n\n\n\nEtiology\nCauses of alar rim retraction include hereditary or familial, congenital, traumatic, or iatrogenic (eg, unfavorable result from previous rhinoplasty) conditions or events.\n\nRhinoplasty is the most common cause of alar retraction that requires surgical attention (see the image below). Long-term scarring of the nose can displace components of the nose. The displacement vector is usually toward areas of structural and volumetric deficits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient with alar retraction secondary to previous rhinoplasty. (Images used by permission from A. John Vartanian, MD.) \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nCephalic excisions of alar cartilages invariably result in some degree of alar retraction by virtue of the dead space created and by cephalic scarring. Fortunately, with conservative excision, the degree of retraction is not aesthetically or functionally noticeable. Local nasal sidewall area excisions (for instance for skin cancers) can also cause alar rim retraction.\n\nIn more aggressive cases of cephalic excision, alar retraction can become clinically apparent. Excision of alar vestibular skin and intranasal mucosa can further contribute to retraction. Vertical dome division and various cartilage-splitting techniques, when combined with cephalic alar excisions, can cause cephalic alar rim retraction. Caudal upper lateral cartilages or scroll resection in the setting of concomitant alar cartilage excision encourages notching.\n\nInappropriately placed interdomal suturing can recruit the lateral aspect of the alar cartilages cephalically and inadvertently create alar arching. Caudal alar cartilage excisions are rarely performed because they can produce unnatural alar contours and can lead to notching.\n\nAcquired alar rim retraction can be caused by too alar excision, alar cartilage division, excision of too much alar sidewall mucosa, and alar skin excision. Primary alar retraction can be due to overarching alar cartilages that are often long and plunging, as well as to alar cartilage malposition.\n\nAlar retraction can also be part of normal nasal anatomy. Long and arched lateral crura (of the alar cartilages) can give a snarled and retracted look to the rim (see the image below). An overdeveloped quadrangular cartilage combined with a high arched ala can further exaggerate the amount of columellar show. Minimal-to-moderate alar notching is noticeable on certain tension noses. Cephalically positioned alar cartilages can also present with alar notching. Other combinations can present with mild-to-moderate alar retraction in an otherwise normal nose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonoperated nose with alar retraction. (Images used by permission from A. John Vartanian, MD.) \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nTrue alar rim retraction with normal columellar position should be differentiated from cases of columellar excess with normal alar rim position. Both cases present with alar-columellar disproportion but require different treatment.\n\nTrauma to the lower nose can result in tissue loss or unfavorable scarring and alar retraction. Localized skin flaps with or without cartilage grafting can be used to restore form and function to alar loss due to trauma or oncologic resection. Congenital conditions (eg, facial clefts) that result in alar hypoplasia can be addressed with local skin flaps and other reconstructive rhinoplasty techniques.\n [9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Back Reconstruction": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nPatients requiring back reconstruction may present with an open wound, unstable scar, exposed hardware, or tissue necrosis. These defects may be either congenital or acquired.\nComplex posterior trunk defects continue to present a challenge to the reconstructive surgeon. Numerous techniques for trunk repair have been described in plastic surgical literature during the past decades. Reconstructive techniques have improved in the past several years because of better understanding of anatomy and recognition of vascular territories and angiosomes. Traditional methods of wound closure using wide undermining of skin flaps and closure under tension no longer are advocated for trunk reconstruction because of high failure rates. More extensive use of muscle- and perforator-based flaps and free tissue transfers to provide single-stage, reliable, and stable coverage has changed the outlook of reconstruction in these complex wounds. The ideal technique to close these wounds must be simple, safe, and easy to perform and must provide well-vascularized tissue that results in long-term durable coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Body Contouring Flankoplasty and Thigh Lift": "\nBackground\n\n\nLocalized and generalized accumulations of lower extremity fat have tested the skills of plastic surgeons for decades. Patients with localized fat accumulations often desire removal for aesthetic reasons, whereas patients with large, especially circumferential, accumulations desire removal for functional as well as aesthetic reasons. Kelly was one of the first to recognize the possibility of direct excision of excess skin and fat of the abdomen.\n [1] This led to direct excision of localized fat on the lower extremities.\nLewis first described the circumferential excision of thigh skin and fat with a vertical closure.\n [2] Farina performed direct lateral excision that, while improving the contour of the lateral thigh, produced huge, highly visible scars.\n [3] Pitanguy was the first to describe a thigh lift incision that was hidden within the bathing suit line.\n [4] This resection also was the first to address inner and outer thigh skin and fat excess and to correct buttock ptosis.\n\n\nOver the years, thigh plasty has evolved from variations on this theme. Major variations dealt with the location of the lateral scar. Baroudi kept his lateral incisions low.\n [5] Regnault et al brought the incision higher, onto the buttock. Finally, Grazer and Klingbeil raised the incisions to the level of the midbuttock to conceal the scar beneath normal clothing.\n [6] \nFlankoplasty rarely is performed alone. It is most often combined with abdominoplasty and thigh plasty procedures (see the image below). Somalo first described the circumferential dermolipectomy.\n [7] Gonzalez-Ulloa first described the belt lipectomy in 1960, adding a vertical wedge resection.\n [8] Whereas belt lipectomy is usually indicated for obesity or excess skin from massive weight loss, partial belt lipectomies can produce dramatic results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrunk and lower extremity. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCraw first described multiple procedures on a patient with massive weight loss, combining abdominoplasty, brachioplasty, mastopexy, and thigh lift.\n [9] Zook was able to standardize the procedure by describing the following individual procedures and their sequence: patient marking (in the standing position), long S-shaped incisions, and preservation of veins and lymphatic vessels.\n [10] As Regnault indicates, the problem is more a resection of redundant skin and subcutaneous fat rather than a resection to cure obesity.\n\nToday, buttock and thigh lifting continue to be relatively rarely performed procedures, for a number of reasons.\n\nExcisional thigh and buttock surgery is technically difficult, can result in significant blood loss, and produces significant scarring. Postoperative morbidity is significant. Suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL) has gained great acceptance because of the relative ease with which it may be performed. Some authors are extending the boundaries in its use for treating obesity.\n [11] Hunstad notes that “excision contouring in the obese patient is appropriate in virtually all areas previously discussed for nonexcisional (SAL) patients.”\n [12] \n\nThe future may rest in developing combinations of the 2 techniques. This is not without risk. In certain areas, performing aggressive superficial liposuction and combining it with wide undermining is not safe. However, with experience and small cannulas (< 3 mm), dramatic results may be obtained.\n\nThe future of flankoplasty depends on the surgeon’s ability to restore normal body contour with the least possible scarring. Certainly, SAL has provided a powerful tool to remove fat. SAL does not treat skin laxity and can worsen truncal deformity. The main goal should be to improve the quality of scars. This can be accomplished by relieving the tension on them. Addressing the superficial fascial system (SFS), as described by Lockwood, appears to be the best way to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Breast Implants": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nBreast implants are designed for use in cosmetic enhancement and reconstruction.\n [1]  According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), there were approximately 193,000 breast augmentation procedures performed in 2020, making this operation one of the top five cosmetic surgical procedures, after nose reshaping, eyelid surgery, facelift, and liposuction (see the image below).\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\nShaped classic implant. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nSaline breast implants\nSaline breast implants are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breast augmentation in women aged 18 years or older and for breast reconstruction in women of any age.

These implants have a silicone outer shell filled with silicone gel of varying consistencies and feature the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable in different sizes\n\n\n\n\nHave smooth or textured surfaces to their shells\n\n\n\n\nMore costly than saline-filled implants\n\n\n\n\nHave a more natural feel than saline-filled implants\n\n\n\n\nLess noticeable rippling in thin-skinned augmentations\n\n\n\n\nTypically cannot be placed through a transumbilical incision (unlike remote-fill ports) but can be implanted through periareolar, inframammary, and transaxillary incisions\n\n\n\nThe introduction of breast implants with cohesive silicone gel, that is, gel featuring a greater number of cross-links between molecules, was aimed at helping the implants retain their shape and inhibiting the gel from disseminating into adjacent tissues. So-called “gummy bear” implants contain a form of silicone called highly cohesive gel.\n [1, 3] \n\nSurgical incisions and dissection planes\nThe 5 surgical approaches to placing breast implants include inframammary, periareolar, transareolar, transaxillary, and transumbilical incision.\n\nBreast implants can be placed either subglandular, submuscular (underneath the pectoralis muscle), or in a dual plane with the superior part of the implant being covered by muscle and the inferior part under the gland\n [4, 5] \n\nPostoperative monitoring\nIn general, most companies guarantee breast implants for 10 years in case of rupture. According to FDA recommendations, asymptomatic patients with silicone gel implants should undergo their first ultrasonogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to screen for rupture 5-6 years after surgery, with screening repeated every 2-3 years. An MRI scan is recommended for patients who are symptomatic or have equivocal ultrasonographic results.\n [6] \n\nWith saline implants, patients should proceed with their recommended mammography protocol for breast cancer screening. Moreover, they can develop capsular contracture over time, and women should return to the plastic surgeon regarding any concerns or questions regarding this.\n\nTypes of complications\nIn general, complication rates are almost always higher in breast reconstruction than in primary cosmetic surgery. A retrospective study by Theunissen et al indicated that in patients undergoing post-mastectomy implant-based breast reconstruction (IBBR), the complication and tissue expander/implant explantation rates of the one-stage procedure were comparable to those for the two-stage operation. However, patients who underwent prophylactic, as opposed to therapeutic, mastectomy were an exception, with the explantation rate after one-stage IBBR surgery being higher than for the two-stage procedure (odds ratio = 4.49).\n [7] \n\nCapsular contractures\n\nStudies offer contrasting findings regarding the risk of capsular contracture with different breast implant design features. For example, some reports indicate decreased capsular contracture rates with textured implants relative to smooth implants, such as in cases of macro-textured implants\n [8, 9]  (including subglandular textured implants),\n [10] but not in cases of medium- or micro-textured ones\n [8]  or submuscular textured implants.\n [11] \n\nOther studies, however, found no significant difference between smooth and textured implants in the subglandular plane\n [12] or between smooth and large-pore textured saline implants. In addition, in the setting of irradiated, reconstructed breasts, the capsular contracture rate remained quite high, even with textured implants.\n [13] \n\nOther complications\n\nIn addition to capsular contractures, the following complications may arise following breast implant procedures:\n\n\n\n\n\nHematoma: Blood collection within the breast that often causes localized swelling and pain necessitates evacuation\n\n\n\n\nSeroma: Thin fluid collection around the implant\n\n\n\n\nWound infection: Most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus from the skin or lactiferous ducts but also owing to more rare pathogens such as Candida albicans, Curvularia spp , Aspergillus niger, mycobacteria, and Clostridium perfringens\n\n\n\n\nChanges in nipple and/or breast sensation: Hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity\n\n\n\n\nImplant rupture: Incidence of about 5-10% at 10 years\n\n\n\n\nIssues with lactation: Difficulty breastfeeding in up to 20% of women\n [14] \n\n\n\n\nAnaplastic large T-cell lymphoma of the breast: Rare\n [15] \n\n\n\n\nPain\n\n\n\n\nImplant displacement\n [16] \n\n\n\n\nImplant rippling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Breast Reconstruction Refinements and Finishing Touches": "\nOverview\n\n\nHistory of the Procedure\nTremendous advances in breast reconstruction have occurred since the late 20th century. Although breast reconstruction with tissue expanders and implants remains the most common form of reconstruction, autogenous tissue has grown more popular.\n [1, 2] In the past decade, breast reconstruction has advanced because of the popularity of skin-sparing mastectomy.\n [1] When immediate reconstruction is performed following a skin-sparing mastectomy in a nonirradiated breast, the demands on the plastic surgeon are reduced and the postoperative result is improved cosmesis.\n [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \n\n\nProblem\nRefinements and finishing touches are generalized terms. Specificity is needed in addressing these topics. The refinements and finishing touches for breast reconstruction with expanders and implants may be far different than those for a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap for immediate reconstruction or a delayed latissimus flap in an irradiated mastectomy defect.\n\n\n\n\nThe deep inferior epigastric artery and vein flap arguably is a refinement of the TRAM flap; likewise, using the internal mammary vessels for a free TRAM flap procedure arguably is a refinement of the traditional use of the thoracodorsal vessels. The following paragraphs discuss some techniques and planning skills for all types of breast reconstruction, with the goal of achieving the best result (see the image below). Although refinements can improve small imperfections in a reconstructed breast, these should not be relied upon to correct improper planning of the initial procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore and after right skin-sparing mastectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma with immediate deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap reconstruction and left mastopexy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor information on breast reconstruction techniques, see the Breast section of Medscape Reference's Plastic Surgery journal.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nBreast shape varies among patients, but knowing and understanding the anatomy of the breast ensures safe surgical planning. The breast is made up of fatty tissue and glandular, milk-producing tissues. The ratio of fatty tissue to glandular tissue varies among individuals. In addition, with the onset of menopause (ie, decrease in estrogen levels), the relative amount of fatty tissue increases as the glandular tissue diminishes.\n\nThe base of the breast overlies the pectoralis major muscle between the second and sixth ribs in the nonptotic state. The gland is anchored to the pectoralis major fascia by the suspensory ligaments first described by Astley Cooper in 1840. These ligaments run throughout the breast tissue parenchyma from the deep fascia beneath the breast and attach to the dermis of the skin. Since they are not taut, they allow for the natural motion of the breast.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Breast Anatomy and Regions and Planes of the Abdomen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Breast Reconstruction With Acellular Dermis": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nWith increasing frequency, surgeons are electing to use acellular dermis to assist with tissue expander– or implant-based primary breast reconstruction.\n [1, 2] In 2020, of the 137,808 breast reconstructions performed in the United States, 83,487 (60.6%) used a tissue expander and implant, and 59,247 (43.0%) employed an acellular dermal matrix (ADM).\n [3]  Several authors have reported favorable results for procedures involving acellular dermis, and rapid early expansion has led to improved cosmetic outcomes.\n [1, 4, 5, 6] \n\n\nADM has been used as a soft tissue replacement since its introduction in 1994.\n [7] ADMs are soft tissue matrix grafts created by a process that results in decellularization but leaves the extracellular matrix intact. This matrix provides a scaffold upon and within which the patient’s own cells can repopulate and revascularize the implanted tissue. Its utility has been demonstrated in various reconstructive techniques, particularly in burn, abdominal wall, and breast reconstruction.\n [7, 8, 9] \nCurrently, several ADMs are available for use by reconstructive surgeons, including human-derived, fully hydrated FlexHD® (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) and BellaDerm® (MTF Biologics, Edison, NJ); human-derived, freeze-dried AlloDerm® (LifeCell, Branchburg, NJ; also available hydrated), AlloMax™ (Bard, Warwick, RI), and DermaMatrix™ (Synthes, West Chester, PA); and porcine-derived Permacol™ (Covidien, Boulder, CO) and Strattice® (LifeCell).\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of ADM has provided surgeons with alternative means of obtaining sufficient vascularized soft tissue to cover the implant, thereby alleviating some complications. Breuing first reported the use of human acellular dermis in implant-based breast reconstruction in 2005.\n [4] Not long after, Bindingnavele reported acellular dermis–assisted tissue expander–based reconstruction.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\nSeveral authors, including Salzberg\n [5] and Spear,\n [1] reported outcomes in the following years, citing increased fill volumes and improved aesthetic outcomes. In 2008, Preminger reported the first comparative study that analyzed intraoperative fill volume differences between ADM and non-ADM cohorts.\n [10] This provided the impetus for several other comparative studies, such as the comparison of ADM technique with submuscular coverage by Sbitany et al.\n [2] \n\nIn 2009, Nahabedian explored the use of acellular dermis in the context of postoperative irradiation.\n [11] This study addressed the increasingly widespread sentiment that acellular dermis affected complication rates in patients receiving postoperative radiation therapy and led other authors, such as Rawlani et al, to explore these effects further.\n [12] Larger studies, such as that of Chun et al,\n [13] published regression analyses of several surgical factors and their influences on complication rates.\n\nThe use of acellular dermis in breast reconstruction continues to be actively explored and will most certainly evolve as new data become available.\n [1, 4, 5, 6] \n\nIndications\nAny woman who is a candidate for tissue expander or implant-based reconstruction is a potential candidate for the use of acellular dermis and should be informed of the option. Indications for expander-implant reconstruction have been described elsewhere. See Breast Reconstruction, Expander-Implant for more information.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nThe significant anatomy of the ADM-assisted expander-implant technique involves the anatomic borders of the breast mound, the associated blood supply, and the nerve supply. See Breast Anatomy for more information.\n\nThe breast mound is bordered superiorly by the second rib, inferiorly by the inframammary fold, medially by the sternum, and laterally by the anterior axillary line. The blood supply to the breast is supplied by the internal mammary artery (a branch of the subclavian artery) on the left and the brachiocephalic artery on the right. The primary innervation to the nipple-areola complex is provided by the lateral branch of the fourth intercostal nerve.\n\nThe pectoralis major originates from the cartilage of the true ribs, starting at the anterior surface of the clavicle and running down the lateral half of the sternum to approximately the sixth or seventh rib. The fibers end laterally at a flat tendon and insert at the lateral lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus. This muscle is dually innervated by the medial and lateral pectoral nerves, arising from the brachial plexus.\n\nThe serratus anterior originates medially from the upper eighth and ninth ribs and inserts at the costal medial margin of the scapula. It is innervated by the long thoracic nerve, which runs inferiorly along the surface of the muscle. Because this nerve is highly exposed, particular care should be taken during reconstructive procedures, especially if an axillary dissection was performed during mastectomy.\n\nThe purpose of using acellular dermis in expander-implant reconstructions is to improve upon or maintain the essential components of breast aesthetics, including the inframammary fold, ptosis, and projection.\n\nThe inframammary fold is the inferior landmark of the breast. It is often altered during mastectomy and is a key component in achieving symmetry with the contralateral breast. Ptosis refers to drooping or overlapping skin in the lower pole that extends over the inframammary fold. Ptosis of the breast is caused by the effects of gravity on the breast tissue over time and is usually difficult to replicate with implants.\n\nFinally, projection refers to the fullness of the breast, as measured by the distance from the chest wall to the most anterior point, usually the nipple. Initially, in the setting of tissue expanders, projection is less than was present with the original breast mound. The original projection may be restored with expansion, especially if the nipple is spared at the time of mastectomy.\n\nThe inferior border of the matrix is used to recreate the inframammary fold. The superior border is attached to the disinserted pectoralis major to create a complete subpectoral, subgraft pocket for expander placement. The acellular dermal sling provides numerous potential benefits. Complete implant coverage reduces the risk of implant exposure, extrusion, visibility, and palpability.\n [1, 5, 6] Tethering of the pectoralis major prevents the implant from migrating and creating an unnatural breast stepoff or fold effacement.\n [1, 5, 6] \n\nThe apparent resistance of acellular dermis to capsular contracture also reduces the chances of implant displacement.\n [1] Ultimately, better control of implant position allows greater lower-pole projection, improved inframammary fold definition, and increased potential for natural-looking ptosis.\n [1, 4, 5, 6] \n\nFurthermore, it is generally felt that by producing a large pectoralis-dermal pocket, acellular dermis permits greater intraoperative tissue expander fill volumes, leading to fewer postoperative expansions and a subsequent acceleration of the expansion process.\n [1, 2, 12] However, this sentiment is not completely unanimous.\n [10] \n\nOutcomes\nOutcomes have been reported in pelvic, abdominal, and chest wall reconstructions\n [8] ; dural repair\n [9] ; hand surgery;\n [14] urethral reconstruction;\n [15] burn surgery\n [16] ; and gingival graft procedures\n [17] . Few authors have argued against the overall safety of acellular dermis–based reconstruction. Most studies have reported improved aesthetic outcomes and acceptable complication rates.\n [2, 18, 19] \n\nIn the literature, comparisons of ADM-assisted reconstruction with traditional expander reconstruction generally do not show statistically relevant differences in overall complication rates. The overall complication rates for reconstructions using ADM range from 3.2% to 48.7%.\n [12, 13, 20, 19] \n\nIn a study of 269 ADM-assisted breast reconstructions, Chun et al reported the following complication profile for ADM: 8.9% rate of infection, 23.4% rate of necrosis, 14.1% rate of seroma, and 2.2% rate of hematoma.\n [13] The investigators also found that ADM-assisted breast reconstructions were associated with higher rates of postoperative seroma and infection than complete submuscular breast reconstruction were.\n\nIn a study of 153 breast reconstructions, Antony et al reported an overall complication rate of 23.6%, with rates of 7.2% for seroma, 2.0% for hematoma, 3.9% for cellulitis, 4.6% for flap necrosis, and 3.3% for infection.\n [19] In a study of 121 breast reconstructions, Rawlani reported an overall complication rate of 16.5%, with rates of 7.4% for infection, 1.7% for seroma, and 6.6% for flap necrosis.\n [12] \n\nA literature review by Smith et al indicated that patients who undergo tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction with a human ADM have a significantly greater risk of flap necrosis (relative risk [RR] = 2.39) and infection (RR = 1.5) than do individuals in whom submuscular reconstruction is performed. However, the two groups were not found to significantly differ with regard to seroma, hematoma, or implant explantation risk.\n [21] \n\nA study by Belmonte and Campbell indicated that the safety profile for breast reconstruction with a prepectoral expander-to-implant technique employing meshed ADM is comparable to that associated with a partially submuscular ADM-assisted procedure. Moreover, the early aesthetic ratings for the prepectoral procedures were similar to those reported with other implant-based reconstructions.\n [22] \n\nA prospective cohort study by Dave et al reported that in patients who undergo a prepectoral implant-based breast reconstruction—most of which in this study were one-stage direct-to-implant procedures employing an ADM—medium-term outcomes with regard to complications and implant loss are acceptable. Over a median 21-month follow-up period, minor and major complications occurred following 11.2% and 5.9% of reconstructions, respectively, while by 3-month follow-up, the rate of implant loss was 3.1%. The study also found that independent risk factors for major complications in these procedures include sentinel node biopsy, axillary clearance, and adjuvant radiotherapy, with sentinel node biopsy was also being an independent risk factor for implant loss.\n [23] \n\nUnfortunately, few studies have compared and stratified differences in outcomes with respect to type of acellular dermis, body mass index (BMI), radiation exposure, or intraoperative expander fill. Becker et al reported an overall complication rate of 4%.\n [24] Losken reported only 1 complication of native skin necrosis in a study of 31 breasts.\n [20] Because of differences in the processing and sterilization of the various ADMs, there is a possibility of alterations in collagen and protein structure that may ultimately affect revascularization and recellularization.\n\nA study by Paprottka et al did look at complications of breast reconstruction using human, porcine, or bovine ADMs, finding the highest complication rate with the bovine variety. The study, with median 3-year follow-up, involved 52 ADM breast reconstructions (41 patients), with human, porcine, and bovine ADM complication rates of 7%, 14%, and 31%, respectively.\n [25] \n\nA literature review by Murphy et al indicated that in implant-based breast reconstruction, the use of a human ADM (HADM) is associated with significantly more overall complications than the use of synthetic mesh or coverage with only a submuscular pocket (no ADM or synthetic mesh). The odds ratio for overall complications with the no-ADM/no-mesh surgery compared with HADM use was 0.53, while for synthetic mesh it was 0.65. Xenograft ADM (XADM) and no-ADM/no-mesh surgery significantly reduced the likelihood of infectious complications compared with HADM, the ORs being 0.60 and 0.67, respectively. The risk of seromas was significantly reduced for synthetic mesh and no-ADM/no-mesh surgery, with ORs of 0.42 and 0.52, respectively. However, the risk of implant loss did not significantly differ between the four techniques.\n [26] \n\nRawlani et al reported an overall complication rate of 30.7% in women who received adjunct breast irradiation, compared with 13.7% in nonirradiated breasts.\n [12] They also noted that outcomes and complication rates with prehydrated ADM were generally comparable to those with freeze-dried ADM.\n\nA study by Winocour et al indicated that in patients who undergo immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction, the 30-day surgical site infection rate is higher when ADM is used. The study reported that the national rate of surgical site infections in such operations is 4.5% when ADM is used, compared with 3.2% in non-ADM cases, with the investigators finding that at their own institution, these rates were 2.1% and 1.6%, respectively.\n [27] \n\nBreuing et al\n [28] noted that despite a higher rate of complications, ADM-assisted tissue expander reconstructions seemed to resist radiation effects better than standard tissue expander reconstructions did—a phenomenon that has been observed by a number of authors and is currently being explored in the literature.\n [11] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Chemical Peels": "\nBackground\n\n\nChemical peeling, also termed chemexfoliation, represents accelerated exfoliation or skin damage induced by caustic agents that cause controlled damage, followed by the release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, resulting in thickening of the epidermis, deposition of collagen, reorganization of structural elements, and increases in dermal volume. This process decreases solar elastosis and replaces and reorients the new dermal connective tissue. The result is an improved clinical appearance of the skin, with fewer rhytides and decreased pigmentary dyschromia, and a more youthful appearance.\nThe images below depict a patient during and after a salicylic acid peel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMen also request chemical peeling.

Lasers largely have supplanted deep chemical peeling because of the control of depth they afford, their lesser effect on pigmentation, and their ease of use, with no chemical adverse effects. Superficial peels, in contrast, have increased in popularity. Various agents are used; for simple exfoliation, glycolic or lactic acids are now commonly found in almost all moisturizers and in many makeup bases.\n\n\n\n\nAging skin undergoes a number of changes. With time, it thins, falls, and creases along muscular and gravitational folds. Compared with the effects of simple aging on skin, sun damage leads to additional and different problems, including thickening, solar elastosis, and resultant pigmentary irregularities. Carcinogenic effects lead to actinic keratoses, basal and squamous cell cancers, and, less directly, to melanomas.\n\nScarring from trauma or acne contributes to an irregular skin surface. True skin laxity in the form of brow ptosis, eyelid bags, jowls and loss of neckline, ear lobule elongation, nasal tip drop, upper lip thinning, and other manifestations are currently treated surgically with facial rejuvenation procedures (eg, face lift, brow lift, rhinoplasty, lip augmentation). Conversely, these procedures do not help skin textural damage. Fine lines, pigmentary irregularities over a broad area, and aging skin are treated with peeling using either chemical or mechanical means.\n\nA discussion of mechanical peeling is warranted for thoroughness. Lasers largely are used for skin ablation, with the carbon dioxide ultrapulsed laser currently used most often. The erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Er:YAG) laser is used more for superficial resurfacing when little tightening and superficial depth of peel are required.\n [1] Fractional laser resurfacing devices have shown encouraging results, especially for acne scarring.\n [2] Many surgeons still use dermabrasion. The lack of control and lack of ability to resurface evenly have resulted in the supplantation of this technique by those already discussed. Microdermabrasion is currently a popular technique because no downtime or discomfort is associated with the procedure. Medical devices tend to have stronger suction, and more abrasive crystals are used, while spa and lay devices tend to be gentler, with less overall effect but increased safety. In general, mechanical abrasion tends to improve scarring more than chemical peeling agents, given similar depth of penetration.\n [3] \n\nCurrently, a number of categories of chemical peeling agents available for rejuvenating the skin can be found. These range from superficial formulations available over the counter to deep chemical agents that should only be applied by a physician in a controlled setting. When used in the proper setting with appropriate technique, nearly all of these products have proven successful in improving quality and appearance of facial skin.\n\nThe goal of chemical peeling is to remove a predictable uniform thickness of damaged skin. Normal wound healing and skin rejuvenation follow, while complications such as scarring and pigmentary changes are minimized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Cryotherapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nCryotherapy, also known as cryosurgery, is a commonly used in-office procedure for the treatment of a variety of benign and malignant lesions. In one report, cryotherapy was the second most common in-office procedure after skin excision. The mechanism of destruction in cryotherapy is necrosis, which results from the freezing and thawing of cells. Treated areas reepithelialize. Adverse effects of cryotherapy are usually minor and short-lived.\nDermatologists have used cryotherapy since the turn of the century. After the development of the vacuum flask to store subzero liquid elements, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, the use of cryotherapy dramatically increased. By the 1940s, liquid nitrogen became more readily available, and the most common method of application was by means of a cotton applicator. In 1961, Cooper and Lee\n [1] introduced a closed-system apparatus to spray liquid nitrogen. In the late 1960s, metal probes became available. By 1990, 87% of dermatologists used cryotherapy in their practice.\n [2] The general advantages of cryotherapy are its ease of use, its low cost, and its good cosmetic results. Most skin cancers are treated with excision or other destructive procedures, such as electrodesiccation and curettage. Superficial basal cell skin cancers\n [3] and Bowen disease can be treated with cryotherapy.\n\n\nRecurrence rates for primary basal cell carcinoma vary with treatment modality. The 5-year recurrence rate for cryotherapy may be as low as 7.5% if lesions are chosen judiciously.\n [4] This percentage compares favorably with published recurrence rates following other procedures. Published rates include surgical excision, 10.1%; curettage and electrodesiccation, 7.7%; radiation therapy, 8.7%; and all non-Mohs modalities, 8.7%. Because these percentages are derived from various studies, rather than 1 randomized controlled study comparing the different modalities, they should be viewed as rough approximations. Well-circumscribed tumors are most suitable for cryotherapy. The indolent local growth of these well-circumscribed tumors accounts for the high cure rates quoted in the literature.\nIn most instances, reimbursement for cryotherapy treatment of skin cancers is at the same rate as for destruction of benign lesions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Ear Reconstruction and Salvage Procedures": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nAcquired ear deformities are typically the result of trauma, skin lesion excisions, and hematomas or infections. The critical reconstruction issues for each of these 3 etiologies are different.\nThe success of ear reconstruction after trauma depends on two main factors. The first of these is vascular patency. The survival of a reconstructed auricle depends on sufficient arterial inflow to nourish the healing graft. Also, venous congestion caused after partial or total amputation can result in cartilage loss. The second factor concerns the availability of soft tissue cover over reimplanted or harvested cartilage framework. Lack of soft tissue cover following a traumatic injury can limit the options available for repair or can require more complex flap coverage.\n\n\nObtaining a balance between size and shape is the most important factor for reconstructions after skin lesion excision. To make the ear appear normal, the surgeon must often sacrifice the size of the underlying cartilage to preserve a normal shape and avoid distortion. Because both ears are not typically seen at the same time, the preservation of anatomic landmarks is more important than maintaining symmetry of size.\nEar reconstruction after infections or hematomas depends on the amount of remaining cartilage support. More extensive cartilage framework involvement in infections or hematomas requires more debridement. Extensive cartilage loss may result in a total ear reconstruction similar to that needed for a congenital ear deformity.\n\n\n\n\nThis discussion presents basic plastic surgery principles and their application to acquired ear deformities. The subject of traumatic lesions to the ear is followed by techniques for repair following controlled extirpations of skin lesions. Many of the techniques described for reconstruction of skin lesion excision can be used in traumatic lesion reconstructions and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nManagement\nSurgery for ear reconstruction and salvage can be accomplished with the following\n\n\n\n\n\n          Skin grafts\n         \n\n\n\n          Cutaneous flaps - Thin-tubed flaps, banner flaps, mastoid flaps\n         \n\n\n\n          Chondrocutaneous flaps - Antia-Buch chondrocutaneous advancement flap, chondrocutaneous conchal flap, island chondrocutaneous postauricular flap\n         \n\n\nSpecific reconstruction and salvage techniques include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pocket principle\n         \n\n\n\n          Microvascular replantation\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Endoscopic-Assisted Breast Augmentation": "\nOverview\n\n\nA dominant trend seen in all branches of surgery is the idea of minimal incisional access to achieve the desired surgical outcome while limiting surgical consequences and facilitating faster patient recoveries. Plastic surgeons have concerned themselves with this issue over a longer time period than have other surgical disciplines. The intent has been to maximize cosmetic benefits for patients through limiting and camouflaging scars.\nIn breast augmentation, one method of achieving this goal is through the remote placement of access incisions, as exemplified by the transaxillary endoscopic augmentation mammaplasty and transumbilical endoscopic augmentation (TUBA) mammaplasty procedures. With these procedures, the incisions are hidden in the first axillary crease and the navel, respectively, making the resulting scars very difficult to see. For this reason, these approaches are favored by many patients and surgeons alike.\n\n\nInstruments using fiberoptics and endoscopic remote manipulation, combined with advances in technique, have resulted in consistently good results in the hands of appropriately trained surgeons. Reticulating endoscopes and high-definition cameras offer new visualization capabilities. These advances continue to bolster enthusiasm for these endoscopic approaches.\nTransaxillary endoscopic augmentation mammaplasty\nThe transaxillary approach to breast augmentation was described by Troques in 1972 and Hoehler in 1973.\n [1, 2] Besides the obvious advantage of the hidden incision, this approach facilitated direct access to the subpectoral plane. With this technique, the inframammary crease was altered and the origin of the pectoralis muscle was dissected blindly, accounting for a significantly higher incidence of implant malposition. The limited exposure of the blind technique did not allow complete division of the prepectoral fascia, resulting in the tendency of high-riding implants or the double-bubble appearance of the inframammary crease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advent of endoscopic plastic surgery in the 1990s allowed the application of the endoscope to breast surgery.\n [3, 4] The Emory group reported their experience with endoscopic breast augmentation through an axillary incision in 1993 using a specialized retractor and an air-filled optical cavity.\n [5] Ho reported a technique that used glycine irrigation to create a liquid-filled optical cavity, although he now also uses a specialized retractor and an air-filled optical cavity.\n [6] The increased control resulting from direct visualization of the dissection obviated many of the previous downfalls of the blind axillary approach. Howard demonstrated the benefits of the endoscope with the axillary approach by decreasing the incidence of implant malposition from 8.6% to 2% when the endoscope was used.\n [7] \n\nEndoscopic transaxillary augmentation mammaplasty is now a widely used technique and has withstood the test of time. However, the learning curve is significant, and more straightforward cases should be considered during the initial experience.\n [8, 9, 10, 11] The axillary approach has limited application in secondary cases.\n [12] \n\nThe images below depict a patient before and after transaxillary endoscopic augmentation mammaplasty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreoperative photograph of patient before undergoing transaxillary endoscopic-assisted breast augmentation. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostoperative photograph of patient after undergoing transaxillary endoscopic-assisted breast augmentation. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nTransumbilical endoscopic augmentation mammaplasty (TUBA)\nThe transumbilical approach was first implemented in 1991 by Johnson and Christ and described in detail in 1993.\n [13] The technique is unique as it does not employ a local or regional incision but rather uses a remote incision in the umbilicus. The TUBA endured significant early criticism but has gained popularity as it has been shown to be safe and reliable. Though TUBA is technically more challenging, a growing number of plastic surgeons are gaining expertise with this procedure. A primary criticism has been a lack of control of the operative site, especially with regard to bleeding and plane of dissection. With improved instrumentation and a general improvement in endoscopic skills, these criticisms have been proven invalid. The original study by Johnson reported a lower complication rate with less bleeding than other methods.\n [13] \n\nRelevant Anatomy\nBreast shape varies among patients, but knowing and understanding the anatomy of the breast (see the image below) ensures safe surgical planning. When the breasts are carefully examined, significant asymmetries are revealed in most patients. Any preexisting asymmetries, spinal curvature, or chest wall deformities must be recognized and demonstrated to the patient, as these may be difficult to correct and can become noticeable in the postoperative period. Preoperative photographs with multiple views are obtained on all patients and maintained as part of the office record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the breast. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe base of the breast overlies the pectoralis major muscle between the second and sixth ribs in the nonptotic state. The gland is anchored to the pectoralis major fascia by the suspensory ligaments first described by Astley Cooper in 1840. These ligaments run throughout the breast tissue parenchyma from the deep fascia beneath the breast and attach to the dermis of the skin. Since they are not taut, they allow for the natural motion of the breast. These ligaments relax with age and time, eventually resulting in breast ptosis. The lower pole of the breast is fuller than the upper pole (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe female breast form. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Breast Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Extended SMAS Facelift": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe superficial surface of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) provides a strategic dissection plane for facial surgery. This superficial musculoaponeurotic plane (SMAP) includes the superficial face of the SMAS/platysma and related surfaces, the superficial temporal fascia, the frontalis, the superficial surface of the facial mimetic muscles, and the superficial cervical fascia over the sternocleidomastoid and posterior triangle. \nThis article describes a technique of cervicofacial rhytidectomy that employs the SMAP for dissection and flap development. Use of the SMAP gives the surgeon flexibility of design and of flap movement (SMAP flap). Extensive shifting of the facial skin with the full thickness of its fascial-fatty layer allows dramatic improvement of severe gravitational effects. This technique is particularly suitable for patients with advanced aging changes.\n [1, 2, 3] \n\n\nThe surgeon evaluates the physical properties of the skin of the patient's face and neck, pulling it in various directions, noting extensibility and secondary effects on facial features. The surgeon observes the direction and magnitude of movement that give the best contours. In effect, the facelift is rehearsed. On the basis of these findings, the surgeon plots a detailed pattern for skin excisions. The pattern is recorded by direct measurement and by photographs for reference in the operating room and for future comparisons.\nFor facelifts on the SMAP, a patterned skin excision provides precision for advancement and closure of the facial flaps. The extended SMAP continues beyond the borders of the SMAS/platysma layer to include the surface of the superficial temporal fascia, orbicularis oculi, frontalis, and superficial cervical fascia. A subcutaneous forehead lift, a facelift, and a platysma myorrhaphy can be performed on the same plane with complete flexibility of access and of flap movement.\n\n\n\n\nHistory of the procedure\nWhen Tessier observed the clinical entity of an SMAS of the face, he motivated Mitz and Peyronie to carry out analysis in the anatomy laboratory.\n [4] Their findings stimulated surgeons to rethink facial dissection planes. The choices now include planes that are within the subcutaneous layer (eg, standard facelift plane, intrasubcutaneous plane), supraplatysmal planes (eg, SMAP), sub-SMAS planes, subplatysmal planes, preperiosteal planes, subperiosteal planes, and any combination.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1963, Limberg published drawings of a facelift in which a typical pattern of skin excision had been rendered as a geometric figure. When the defect was closed, the triangle and trapezoids collapsed into a linear closure, and a convincing lift of the dependent facial skin was illustrated. Limberg's drawings were based on geometry without regard to biomechanics, but they were a prototype for precision in planning.\n\nIn 1987, the author reported the use of manual rehearsal of the facelift plan incorporating biomechanical evaluation and plotting the pattern for skin excision with the aid of anthropometric landmarks.\n\nIncidental to illustrations of retaining ligaments of the cheek, in 1989, the author showed the SMAP and subsequently presented a video demonstration of the SMAP flap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Fasciocutaneous Flaps": "\nOverview\n\n\nFasciocutaneous flaps are tissue flaps that include skin, subcutaneous tissue and the underlying fascia. Including the deep fascia with its prefascial and subfascial plexus enhances the circulation of these flaps. They can be raised without skin and are then referred to as fascial flaps.\n [1] \nUse fasciocutaneous flaps to provide coverage when a skin graft or random skin flap is insufficient for coverage (eg, in coverage over tendon or bones). Orient the flap along the direction of the supplying vessel; knowledge of the direction or orientation of the fascial plexus, the fasciocutaneous perforators, and the fascial septum is required. They are simple to elevate, quick, and fairly reliable in healthy patients.\n\n\nBecause they are less bulky, fasciocutaneous flaps are indicated when thinner flaps are required. Unlike with muscle flaps, no functional loss occurs. Although these flaps provide a donor site in areas that are not available for random axial flaps, significant donor site morbidity can be associated with these flaps. Fasciocutaneous flaps are not as resistant to infection as muscle flaps. Monitoring flap failure occasionally can be difficult.\nA questionnaire study by Seyidova et al comparing muscle with fasciocutaneous free flaps for lower limb reconstruction found that the fasciocutaneous patients were more satisfied with flap texture than were individuals who received the muscle flap. However, no significant differences between the two flaps were found with regard to contour, similarity to the contralateral side, flap bulkiness, color match, scarring, overall appearance, and donor-site outcomes.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Fibula Tissue Transfer": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe fibula free flap provides a long, strong segment of bone for use in reconstructive surgery. It can be harvested as a purely osseus flap or can include a large fasciocutaneous component if needed. The pedicle runs the length of the fibula, with perforators extending to supply the skin paddle. To date, no other flap is capable of providing such a long segment of bone; up to 26 cm can be taken without affecting leg function. A segment of bone must be preserved distally, however, to support the ankle, and proximally to avoid injury to the peroneal nerve.\nLoss of tissue resulting from cancer ablation or debridement of infected tissues or secondary to trauma provides the reconstructive surgeon with various challenges.\n [1] (See the first image below.) Defects of the head and neck may involve one or a number of tissues, including skin, cartilage, fascia, and bone. The idea of replacing “like with like” holds true in all facets of reconstructive surgery, but none so obviously as in the case of osseous defects. While reconstruction of soft-tissue defects may require a fasciocutaneous or musculocutaneous flap, composite tissue loss that includes bone should be managed with a flap that contains vascularized bone. (See the second image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplex defect involving anterior mandibular arch. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fibula free flap is well suited for anterior mandibular arch defects.

More commonly, a split thickness skin graft is needed.\n\nA literature review by Okay et al indicated that in the period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2014, the number of patients worldwide reported to undergo the use of a fibula free flap in mandibular reconstruction was 3.4-fold greater in the second 5-year period than in the first.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Gracilis Tissue Transfer": "\nOverview\n\n\nFor decades prior to its introduction into head and neck reconstruction, the gracilis muscle has been used as a local pedicled flap to restore sphincteric function in the anogenital area. Other uses of the gracilis have included coverage for moderately sized soft tissue defects in the upper and lower extremities, treatment of chronic osteomyelitis, and functional rehabilitation of the upper extremity. Freilinger was the first to use a free muscle graft for the reanimation of facial paralysis.\n [1] However, in 1976, Harrii was the first to use the gracilis as a free tissue flap with microvascular anastomosis for facial rehabilitation.\n [2] In the head and neck, the main indication for gracilis free tissue transfer is for dynamic midfacial and lip reanimation for long-standing facial paralysis.\n [3, 4] \nThe gracilis muscle free flap is based on a single anatomically constant neurovascular pedicle. The muscle has an easily accessible donor site that allows a 2-team approach and has acceptable donor site morbidity. This muscle demonstrated reliable results for sustaining facial function after transfer. The gracilis muscle free flap is generally performed as a 2-stage procedure: the cross-facial nerve graft is the first stage, and the second stage is the actual muscle transfer. In 1990, O'Brien was the first to report the use of the gracilis free flap for single-stage facial reanimation.\n [5] The revascularized gracilis muscle is one of the few muscles that has been used to attempt to achieve the most elusive of facial palsy rehabilitative goals: restoration of spontaneous emotional expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Approximately 2 million soft tissue filler procedures were performed in the United States in 2012 by both physicians and nurse injectors.\n [2, 3] Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the most frequently used agent in the United States (87% of all soft tissue filler procedures), and there has been a 38% increase in its popularity since 2004.\n [2] In fact, HA has become the most commonly used filler worldwide.\n [4, 5] Not all injectables are created equal, however, and no filler is ideal, nor can a single filler meet every patient's wishes and expectations.\n [6] \nBroadly, facial fillers can be divided into 4 categories: autologous fat, collagens, hyaluronic acid, and synthetic fillers (see the Indications section below).

Zocchi's interest in ultrasound was originally for harvesting collagen from aspirated fat. The observations that adipose tissues were effectively emulsified while connective tissue structures were preserved in vitro led to the concept of using ultrasound adjunctively in vivo. This led to clinical use of first-generation devices (eg, SMEI, Casales), which used blunt solid probes 4-6 mm in diameter followed by aspiration with standard cannulas.\n\n\nThe promise of enhanced fat removal with minimal blood loss, claims of improved skin retraction, and safer large-volume procedures resulted in intense interest in UAL. However, enthusiasm was tempered by reports of skin burns, dysesthesias, and high seroma rates. Although considerable debate remains concerning the long-term effects and clinical use of UAL, it has become a well-established tool in the body-contouring armamentarium.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient 1 before ultrasonic-assisted liposuction (used with permission from Baxter Plastic Surgery). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, using cosmetic surgery tracer data from the American Board of Plastic Surgery, Stein et al found evidence of a decreased use of ultrasound-assisted liposuction.

        "Laser Treatment of Leg Veins": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nPublic interest in laser and light treatment of leg veins is high, and, under the right circumstances, excellent results can be achieved with this treatment modality. With any laser or light source treatment, reverse pressure from associated reticular or varicose veins must be recognized and eliminated; otherwise, the treatment is doomed to fail. Many patients benefit from a combination of treatments such as sclerotherapy, ambulatory phlebectomy, and intravascular laser or radiofrequency closure, because external lasers and light sources do not effectively treat associated reticular and varicose veins. Lasers can be effective in treating vessels of less than 1-2 mm in diameter that are resistant to sclerotherapy and treatment for telangiectatic matting, which can occur postsclerotherapy. However, sclerotherapy remains the criterion standard for the treatment of leg veins and telangiectasias.\n [1] \n\n\nNot until the development of pulsed dye lasers (PDLs) in the late 1980s were the first reasonable results achieved on leg veins.\n [2, 3, 4] Development over the last decade of longer wavelength, longer pulse duration pulsed lasers and light sources has greatly improved outcomes. Basic requirements for a laser or a light source to treat leg veins are a wavelength that is proportionately better absorbed by the target (hemoglobin) than surrounding chromophores and penetration to the full depth of the target blood vessel. Sufficient energy must be delivered to damage the vessel without damaging the overlying skin, and this must be delivered over an exposure time long enough to slowly coagulate the vessel and its lining without damaging surrounding tissue.\nThe choice of wavelength and pulse duration is related to the type and the size of the target vessel. Deeper vessels require a longer wavelength to allow penetration to their depth. Pulse duration must be matched to vessel size; the larger the vessel diameter, the longer pulse duration required to effectively damage the vessel thermally. To be most effective, thermal injury must encompass the full thickness and circumference of the vein wall endothelium, rather than just the most superficial aspect of the vein wall. The relative importance of the hemoglobulin absorption peaks in green (541 nm) and red to infrared (800-1000 nm) shifts as the depth and the size of the blood vessel changes. Absorption by hemoglobin in the long-visible to near-infrared range appears to become more important for vessels more than 0.5 mm and at least 0.5 mm below the skin surface.\n\n\n\n\nThe following related Medscape Drugs & Diseases articles may be of interest:\n\n\n\n\n\nVaricose Vein Treatment With Endovenous Laser Therapy\n\n\n\n\nVaricose Veins and Spider Veins\n\n\n\n\nRadiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Varicose Veins\n\n\n\n\nComplications of Dermatologic Laser Surgery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nCarbon dioxide lasers were used early in an effort to obliterate telangiectatic vessels by means of vaporization with a small spot size. Absorption properties of the carbon dioxide laser light cause nonspecific thermal injury because the chromophore is water. Because water is in all tissues around the targeted blood vessel, scarring with a poor cosmetic result is the outcome. Hence, studies using carbon dioxide lasers have demonstrated unsatisfactory cosmetic results.\n\nArgon (488 nm and 514 nm) and continuous-wave dye lasers (515-590 nm) have also been used historically because they are well absorbed by hemoglobin and penetrate to the depth of middermal vessels, more than 1 mm into the skin. Nonspecific thermal damage is the result of the longer or continuous pulses heating up surrounding tissue nonspecifically. The results of treatment of leg veins using these wavelengths have been discouraging, even with the addition of skin cooling.\n\nContinuously running Nd:YAG lasers were also tried when they were first brought to the medical marketplace. Results were poor secondary to nonspecific heating of surrounding water and the large depth of penetration (up to 3.7 mm).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Laser-Assisted Hair Removal": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe need for a rapid, noninvasive method for hair removal has led to the development of various light sources for hair removal. These include ruby, alexandrite, diode, and Nd:YAG lasers and intense pulsed light sources. These devices target either an endogenous chromophore (eg, melanin) or an exogenous chromophore (eg, carbon suspension, photosensitizer, exogenous dye). This article discusses the basic principles of laser hair removal, examines the attributes of specific laser systems, and focuses on patient selection and treatment protocols for the various systems designed to ensure safe and effective treatment.\n [1] \nMechanisms for hair removal with light\nLight can destroy hair follicles by thermal (due to local heating), mechanical (due to shock waves or violent cavitation), or photochemical (due to generation of toxic mediators like singlet oxygen or free radicals) mechanisms. Hair removal has been attempted using each of these 3 means.\n\n\nPhotothermal destruction\n\n\n\n\nLasers and noncoherent light sources have recently been introduced to induce selective damage to hair follicles. The mechanisms by which these systems induce selective damage to hair follicles are based on the principles of selective photothermolysis. This principle predicts that selective thermal damage of a pigmented target structure will result when sufficient fluence at a wavelength, preferentially absorbed by the target, is delivered during a time equal to or less than the thermal relaxation time of the target.\nIn the visible to near-infrared region, melanin is the natural chromophore for targeting hair follicles. Lasers or light sources that operate in the red or near-infrared wavelength region (694-nm ruby laser, 755-nm alexandrite laser, 800-nm diode laser, 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser, and noncoherent light sources with cut-off filters) all lie in an optical window of the spectrum in which selective absorption by melanin is combined with deep penetration into the dermis. Therefore, deep and selective heating of the hair shaft, the hair follicle epithelium, and the heavily pigmented matrix is possible in the 600- to 1100-nm region.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, melanin in the epidermis presents a competing site for absorption. Selective cooling of the epidermis has been shown to minimize epidermal injury. Cooling can be achieved by various means, including ice, a cooled gel layer, a cooled glass chamber or sapphire window, a pulsed cryogen spray, or cooled airflow.\n\nLaser pulse width also appears to play an important role, as suggested by the thermal transfer theory. Thermal conduction from the melanin-rich shaft and matrix heats surrounding follicular structures. To obtain spatial confinement of thermal damage, the pulse duration should be shorter or equal to the thermal relaxation time of the hair follicle. Thermal relaxation of human terminal hair follicles has never been measured, but it is estimated to be approximately 10-100 milliseconds, depending on size.\n\nTherefore, devices for hair removal have pulse durations in the millisecond domain region. The normal-mode 694-nm ruby, normal-mode 755-nm alexandrite, 800-nm pulsed diode lasers, long-pulsed Nd:YAG lasers, and filtered flashlamp technology all use this mechanism.\n\nThe concept of thermal damage time has recently been launched in the case of the hair follicle. The melanin-rich hair shaft and matrix cells occupy a relatively small volume, and propagation of the thermal damage front through the entire volume takes 3-20 times longer than the thermal relaxation time of the hair follicle. Super–long-pulse heating (>100 milliseconds) appears to allow for long-term hair removal.\n\nPhotomechanical destruction\n\nPhotomechanical destruction of hair has been attempted with very short nanosecond pulses by Q-switched 1064-nm Nd:YAG lasers, with and without carbon suspension; however, when these very short pulses are used to target hair follicles, extremely rapid heating of the chromophore (melanin) occurs. This generates photoacoustic shock waves that cause focal photomechanical disruption of the melanocytes but not complete follicular disruption.\n\nTherefore, the Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers are not likely to produce long-term hair removal. Consistent with this behavior, permanent hair loss has not been reported in humans after Q-switched laser treatments despite a decade of using Q-switched ruby and Nd:YAG lasers widely for tattoo removal.\n\nPhotochemical destruction of hair follicles\n\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is the use of light and a photosensitizer to produce therapeutic effects. Hair removal with topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been reported in a pilot study. A mean hair loss of 40% was reported in 12 volunteer subjects after a single exposure to 630-nm light 3 hours after an application of 20% ALA to the skin. ALA is a precursor in porphyrin synthesis and is rapidly and selectively converted to protoporphyrin IX by cells derived from the epidermis and follicular epithelium. Upon absorption of a photon, protoporphyrin IX efficiently crosses into an excited triplet state, which, in turn, generates singlet oxygen by collision with ground-state oxygen. Singlet oxygen is a potent oxidizer that damages cell membranes and protein.\n [2] This is a so-called photodynamic reaction. A host of other porphyrins, chlorins, phthalocyanines, purpurins, and phenothiazine dyes can act as photodynamic agents and are under development as drugs for photodynamic therapy. ALA or one of these other drugs will likely prove useful for hair removal. This approach will potentially provide an effective means of treating nonpigmented hair.\n\nTerminology and histology\nHair removal is a vague term that has recently been defined. Temporary hair reduction is defined as a delay in hair growth, which usually lasts 1-3 months, consistent with the induction of telogen. Permanent hair reduction refers to a significant reduction in the number of terminal hairs after a given treatment, which is stable for a period of time longer than the complete growth cycle of hair follicles at the given body site. It has recently been suggested to add another 6 months to this posttreatment observation time (ie, the time necessary for a damaged follicle to recover from the laser injury and reenter a normal growth cycle).\n\nA distinction needs to be made between permanent and complete hair loss. Complete hair loss refers to a lack of regrowing hairs (ie, a significant reduction in the number of regrowing hairs to zero). Complete hair loss may be either temporary or permanent. Laser treatment usually produces complete but temporary hair loss for 1-3 months, followed by partial but permanent hair loss. Histological observations show damage predominantly in hair follicles with large, pigmented shafts, while hair follicles with small (< 25 mm), hypopigmented shafts do not demonstrate any morphological change.\n\nImmediately after laser treatment, the hair shaft shows fragmentation with focal rupture into the follicular epithelium and thermal damage to the surrounding follicular epithelium. The extent of thermal damage is dependent on the pulse width but retains confinement on the spatial scale of the follicle itself. One month later, most follicles are in telogen phase while others are being replaced by fibrosis and a foreign body giant cell reaction with phagocytosis of melanin. At 1 year, most follicles are replaced by miniaturized hair follicles (dominant mechanism), and some are replaced by a fibrotic remnant. Both of these histological findings produce permanent clinical reduction in hair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Latissimus Myocutaneous Flap": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap (LDMF) is one of the most reliable and versatile flaps used in reconstructive surgery.\n [1, 2] It is known for its use in chest wall and postmastectomy reconstruction and has also been used effectively for coverage of large soft tissue defects in the head and neck, either as a pedicled flap or as a microvascular free flap. The earliest application of the latissimus flap for head and neck reconstruction was described by Quillen in 1978, and microvascular free tissue transfer of the flap was described by Watson in 1979.\n [3] \nThe latissimus dorsi may be transferred as a myofascial flap, a myocutaneous flap, or as a composite osteomyocutaneous flap when harvested with underlying serratus anterior muscle and rib. For even greater reconstructive flexibility, the latissimus can be harvested for free tissue transfer in combination with any or all of the other flaps based on the subscapular vessels (the so-called subscapular compound flap or “mega-flap”), including serratus anterior, scapular, and parascapular flaps. The LDMF may be used to provide a sensate reconstruction when it is transferred with an intact neurovascular bundle. Importantly, using the LDMF does not compromise the use of other regional flaps, such as the deltopectoral flap and pectoralis major flap, which can then be used in secondary reconstructions if required.\n [4] \n\n\nAdvantages of the LDMF include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge volume of tissue is available for reconstruction.\n\n\n\n\nLong vascular pedicle offers excellent range for pedicled flaps.\n\n\n\n\nHigh caliber pedicle makes free flap vascular anastomoses technically more feasible, even in patients with significant atherosclerotic disease.\n\n\n\n\nThe possibility of independent skin paddles being able to address complex defects (eg, through-and-through oral cavity defects)\n\n\n\n\nRib or scapula bone is available.\n\n\n\n\nMinimal donor site morbidity occurs.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be combined with other subscapular flaps, when indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese advantages allow the LDMF to address a wide array of defects in head and neck and chest wall reconstruction.\n [5, 6] The long pedicle length allows the flap to easily reach defects as far as the temporoparietal area. The LDMF is also appropriate to cover large scalp defects when used as a muscle-only free flap combined with a split-thickness skin graft.\n [7] Reconstruction of the mandible and/or facial skeleton has also been described when the flap is harvested with underlying rib . Harii has described motor reinnervation with anastomosis of the thoracodorsal nerve, which may be useful for facial reanimation or to allow functional reconstruction of the tongue. Oral cavity and oropharyngeal defects, including through-and-through defects, may also be addressed with the LDMF.\n\n\n\n\nA prospective study by Yang et al found that in patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction with a latissimus dorsi flap, shoulder strength and range of motion returned to their presurgical baseline values within 1 year postsurgery, although functional disability and quality of life associated with the flap procedure remained below baseline (as measured using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] questionnaire and the physical component of the 36-item short-form health survey [SF-36]).\n [8] \n\nA study by Mericli et al indicated that following breast-conserving therapy, partial breast defects can safely and effectively be treated with LDMF reconstruction. At median 5.4-year follow-up, the investigators found an overall complication rate of 8.5% and BREAST-Q scores of 61 (Satisfaction with Breasts) and 87 (Psychosocial Well-being). As measured by plastic surgeons and laypersons using the 5-point Likert scale, a median aesthetic score of 4 was obtained.\n [9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Lower Lid Arcus Marginalis Release Blepharoplasty": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nAn emerging concept in cosmetic surgery is that the characteristics of facial aging are a result of not only elastosis and sagging but also the atrophy of soft tissue and, particularly, fat.\n [1, 2] The evolution of this concept is well illustrated in the field of lower lid blepharoplasty, in which the traditional approach to the amelioration of so-called bags is to resect the \"herniating\" orbital fat.\n [3] While this method can indeed eliminate bags, it may also eliminate the soft tissue that conceals the infraorbital rims, creating a hollowed, skeletonized appearance (see the top half of the image below). This is in contradistinction to the truly youthful face, in which soft tissue fullness creates a smooth, almost imperceptible transition from the cheek to the lower lid, with no visibility of the bony orbital rim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop. Drawback of traditional lower blepharoplasty. In the youthful face, the lower lid has a smooth contour, and the underlying infraorbital rim is invisible (A). With age, the orbital septum becomes slack, permitting the herniation of orbital fat into bags (B). Traditional lower blepharoplasty calls for resection of protruding fat; the result can be accentuation of the infraorbital rim and hollowing of the orbit (C). Bottom. Arcus marginalis release. After dissecting the orbicularis off the septum, cutting cautery is used to release the arcus marginalis (A). Orbital fat is advanced, and the orbital septum is reset onto the facial aspect of the maxilla. Both fat and septum are secured to periosteum with multiple interrupted 5-0 polyglactin sutures (B). The result is a smooth contour that obscures the infraorbital rim and resembles the contour of youth (C). \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nMultiple alternative approaches have been and continue to be devised to address this problem.\n [4] One such technique that has gained prominence is the arcus marginalis release, in which orbital fat is advanced (rather than resected) to reconstruct the soft tissue of the lower lids.\n [5, 6, 7, 8] This technique is designed to conceal the underlying bony structure of the inferior orbit in an attempt to impart a more youthful contour to the periorbital area.\n\n\n\n\nStatistics\nThe Aesthetic Society estimated that in 2021, more than 149,000 blepharoplasties were performed in the United States, making it the fifth most popular aesthetic surgical procedure in the country. With regard to gender, blepharoplasty was the sixth most common aesthetic surgical procedure among women (130,489), and the third most common among men (18,688).\n [9] \n\n\n\n\nHistory of the procedure\nLoeb was among the first to describe the advancement of the medial lower lid fat pad to recontour the nasojugal groove.\n [10] Shortly thereafter, Hamra published his description of the arcus marginalis release technique, in which he extended Loeb's concept to include advancement of all of the lower lid fat pads in an effort to conceal the infraorbital rim and to recreate the youthful fullness of the lower lid.\n [5] As originally described, the arcus marginalis was incised and the orbital fat alone was advanced and sutured to the preperiosteal fat of the upper cheek. Subsequently, Hamra refined his technique to include advancement of the septum and orbital fat en bloc, providing more secure purchase for suturing. He termed this procedure the septal reset.\n [11] \n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe image below depicts the anatomy of the lower eyelid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the lower lid. The orbicularis oculi (O) overlies the orbital septum (S), which retains the orbital fat pads (F) within the orbit. The septum fuses with the maxillary periosteum (P) inferiorly and the tarsus (T) superiorly. The capsulopalpebral fascia (C) arises from the fascial sheaths of the inferior rectus (R) and inferior oblique (Q) and merges with the septum at the tarsus. The inferior tarsal muscle (M) is contained within the capsulopalpebral fascia. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe orbicularis oculi muscle is immediately deep to the skin of the lower lid. This muscle extends from near the ciliary margin past the infraorbital rim to the cheek. Deep to the orbicularis is the orbital septum. The suborbicularis fascia, a plane of loose, fibrous connective tissue, intervenes between the orbicularis and orbital septum and provides an excellent dissection plane. The orbital septum fuses superiorly with the tarsal plate and inferiorly with the periosteum of the infraorbital rim; this inferior attachment of the septum is termed the arcus marginalis.\n\nThe orbital septum serves to retain orbital fat within the orbit. Although composed of inelastic fibrous tissue, the septum can slacken with age, permitting orbital fat to herniate anteriorly into bags. (In addition, a study by Fezza and Massry reported that the vertical length of the lower eyelid increases with age, with an average lid length of 10.4 mm in persons aged 20-29 years having increased to 18.6 mm in individuals aged 90-99 years.\n [12] )\n\nThe arcus marginalis is strongest and most sharply defined medially, where it attaches to the anterior lacrimal crest. As it extends laterally, the arcus marginalis thins and weakens. It also assumes a more inferior and anterior insertion; thus, medially, it runs along the inner aspect of the rim, but laterally, it attaches approximately 2 mm inferior to the rim on the facial aspect of the zygomatic bone.\n\nThree compartments of orbital fat are located posterior to the orbital septum. Many delicate fibrous septa invest these compartments. The inferior oblique muscle, originating from the anteromedial orbital wall, separates the medial and central fat compartments as it extends posterolaterally under the globe. The arcuate expansion, an extension of the fascial sheath of the inferior oblique, continues laterally to attach to the lateral orbital rim and separates the central and lateral compartments.\n\nSubtle differences exist among the 3 orbital fat pads. The fat of the medial compartment is typically white and membranous, while that of the other 2 compartments appears yellow and fluffy. The lateral fat pad contains more septa than the others and is therefore less likely to herniate anteriorly. Lower palpebral vessels travel directly through the medial fat pad.\n\nThe capsulopalpebral fascia, a structure analogous to the levator apparatus of the upper lid, extends between the orbital fat pads and the globe. The capsulopalpebral fascia arises from the fascial sheaths of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique and, along with the orbital septum, inserts at the inferior margin of the tarsal plate. Included among its many layers are a lax superficial membrane, a muscular component (inferior tarsal muscle), and a deep layer that attaches to the conjunctival fornix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Mandibular Plating": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe reconstruction of oromandibular defects (mandibular reconstruction) following surgical extirpation of oral cavity carcinoma presents a significant surgical challenge. Mandibular deformities and defects may result from trauma, infections, prior radiation exposure, neoplasms, and congenital defects; most mandibular deformities result from ablative surgery for neoplasms. Approximately 24,000 patients have new cancers of the oral cavity each year.\n [1] The resultant changes in normal oromandibular anatomy are often functionally disabling and socially isolating. Once complete resection of the primary and regional metastases has been undertaken, subsequent functional recovery and aesthetics are extremely important when reconstruction is considered.\nWithin the last few decades, many advances in head and neck surgical techniques, plate technology, and microvascular surgery have improved the functional restoration in this patient population. However, the expansion in knowledge and the development of techniques have left surgeons with a large number of reconstructive options, few of which are supported by findings from prospective randomized trials.\n [2] The purpose of this article is to assist surgeons with the selection of reconstructive techniques and patients to achieve the best possible outcome.\n\n\nThe rationale for reconstruction\nRehabilitation and reconstruction of the oral cavity following the resection of pathologic processes remains a complex challenge. The mandible assists in verbalization, oral competence, mastication, deglutination, and airway support, yet it is also a major aesthetic highlight of the face. With oromandibular pathology, a loss of not only bony support but also neighboring soft tissues, muscles, and nerves is frequently present. Thus, large complex defects can be created during resection. Functional and aesthetic outcomes become less favorable as the extent of resection increases.\n [3] Without reconstruction, patients may have functional and cosmetic impairments.\n\n\n\n\nThe reconstructive surgeon attempts to redefine the preoperative functions and facial aesthetic units to allow the patient to return to a normal family and social life. The approach includes the placement of dentures or osseointegrated implants to help shape the face and to assist with mastication and verbalization.\n [3] Other important factors for rehabilitation are intact motor and sensory functions of the tongue. Loss of these functions, independent of any mandibular continuity defect, can vastly hinder oral function and competence, and many patients receive little benefit in deglutination with aggressive mandibular reconstruction.\n [4] Therefore, attention must be given to total reconstruction and postoperative rehabilitation if the patient is to derive maximum benefit.\n\n\n\n\nSee the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreoperative view of patient with floor of mouth squamous cell carcinoma invading the mandible.\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Mid Face Facelift": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe mid face is the area lying between the bicanthal and oral commissure. The mid face is one of the first facial areas to show signs of aging. As individuals age, the bony skeleton and soft tissues of the face lose volume, producing a slightly wider orbital aperture and less anterior projection. This decreases the overall projection of the cheek and diminishes bony support for the overlying soft tissue structures. The preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle loses tone, resulting in herniation of the intraorbital fat.\nPtosis of midfacial adiposity exposes the inferior orbital rim. Further descent of cheek fat and separation from the suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF) can be heralded by a faint diagonal groove in the infraorbital area parallel to the nasolabial crease. Furthermore, descent of the Bichat fat pad over the upper mandible can increase lower facial jowling.\n\n\nIndividuals in their early 30s may have descent of the malar fat pad; this may lead to the formation of infraorbital dark circles and deepening of the nasolabial and nasojugal (tear trough) creases. These changes occur earlier in the presence of poor bony support and midface retrusion.\nDuring the past 15 years, several techniques have been described to specifically address the mid face, since this area is not addressed with standard cervicofacial rhytidectomy.\n [1] Presently, restoration of cheek contour and volume can be achieved by performing a subperiosteal, vertically oriented lift with independent suspension of the various cheek structures. The lift can be performed with small and hidden incisions and supplemented with a cheek implant if deemed necessary.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] \n\n\n\n\nHistory of the procedure\nEarly in the authors' practice, an extended open subperiosteal facelift was performed, and the intermediate temporal fascia (see image below) was used to anchor the mid face. To better elevate the cheek, the suspension point was changed to the suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF). These techniques usually were performed through a full blepharoplasty incision, but this resulted in an unacceptable level of eyelid retraction.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidface facelift. The dissection over the zygomatic arch (ZA) is challenging due to the proximity of the frontal branch of the facial nerve (FN). Dissection starts over the temporal fascia proper (TFP) and proceeds inferiorly and anteriorly over the intermediate temporal fascia. Just before reaching the zygomatic arch, the fascia is incised and the intermediate temporal fat pad (IFP) is divided. The IFP is raised in continuity with the periosteum overlying the ZA. The masseter muscle (MM) is divided in line with its fibers.Just above the plane of dissection lie the FN and the superficial temporal fascia (STF). Directly beneath the plane of dissection lie the TFP and its underlying temporalis muscle. The deep temporal fascia (DTF) overlies the deep temporal fat pad (DFP). The large arrow represents the direction of dissection. The parotid gland is indicated by PG. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe access incision then was modified to a crow's foot incision, spreading the orbicularis oculi at the site of the incision without disrupting the muscle. The orbital septum was not violated. The infraorbital fat only was resected in patients with obvious proptosis (5% of patients). With these modifications, no permanent ectropion or eyelid malposition was observed.\n\nThe authors now have eliminated the need to perform any periocular incision. The periosteum is raised over the entire anterior malar area and the anterior two thirds of the zygomatic arch. Tunnels are made over the zygomatic arch, and independent suture suspension of the SOOF, inferior malar soft tissues, and Bichat fat pad is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Muscle and Musculocutaneous Flaps": "\nHistory\n\n\nFlappe is a term from the 16th century denoting something that hangs broad and loose, attached by only one side. The evolution of the flap courses tortuously over the centuries, illustrating the intense drive for humans to reconstruct deficient anatomy and create form where originally absent. As such, flaps premiered long before the comfort and convenience of anesthesia. In India in 600 BC, Sushruta Samita described operations for nasal reconstruction—a necessity during the pre-Christian era, since amputation of the nose (an organ of \"respect and reputation\") was common as criminal punishment.\nAs years passed, many advances regarding flap use arose, including extensive facial flaps and the first cross-leg flap.\n [1, 2] However, the first muscle flap in recorded history debuted in 1906. Louis Ombredanne of Paris described the use of the pectoralis minor muscle for breast reconstruction following mastectomy. That same year, Tanzini introduced the latissimus dorsi muscle flap for postmastectomy breast reconstruction. As breast surgery became more radical, the human drive toward reconstruction created and stimulated the appearance of the first musculocutaneous flap (ie, muscle in addition to overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue). In 1912, Professor Stefano d'Este introduced this technique. He used the latissimus dorsi muscle and the skin of that same area to reconstruct the chest wall after mastectomy.\n\n\nDevelopments in anesthesia, antibiotics, hematology, and wound healing brought about routine use of flaps with good postoperative results. Improvements in surgical technique and advances in microsurgery also resulted in more complex flaps, resulting in composite and compound pedicled and muscle flaps.\n [3, 4] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nasal Reconstruction Following Tumor Removal": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction to Nasal Reconstruction\nThe nose occupies a prominent place in the center of the face, making it a structure of obvious aesthetic significance. The delicate reconstruction of this facial structure following tumor removal procedures cannot be overemphasized. With thoughtful attention to surgical planning and use of proper surgical technique, the dermatologic surgeon can restore both the form and the function of the nose.\n [1] \n\n\nThe goal of this article is to provide an understanding of the relative indications for several reconstructive options. Detailed discussions of proper surgical techniques are beyond the scope of this work.\nIndications for Nasal Reconstruction\nThe surgeon should assess the need for a reconstructive procedure after adequate tumor removal. Reconstructive procedures are typically offered when the wound is deemed unsuitable for secondary intention healing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven on a delicate nose, secondary intention healing can result in aesthetically acceptable results when the wound is small and shallow. Areas of the nose that heal well by secondary intention include the concavity of the nasal root in the area of the medial canthus and the concavity of the alar groove. Secondary healing typically produces acceptable results when the wound is less than 1 cm in diameter, less than 4-5 mm in depth, and greater than 5-6 mm in distance from the mobile alar margin. A reconstructive procedure should be considered if these wound criteria are not satisfied.\n\nReconstructive procedures have the opportunity to increase the speed of healing, to prevent disastrous wound contraction that produces functionally significant deformity, and to produce aesthetically optimal results.\n\nContraindications to Nasal Reconstruction\nNasal reconstruction methods have few contraindications. If the patient tolerates tumor extirpation well, a nasal reconstructive procedure will likely be tolerated. Care should be exercised when previous surgical procedures or radiation therapy have altered the nose, because perfusion of nasal tissues then becomes highly unpredictable. Care should also be exercised in patients who use tobacco heavily; however, the influence of cigarette smoking on the survival of small nasal flaps is likely limited, unless tobacco use is extreme. Other medical conditions that may have a negative impact on the success of nasal reconstruction (as with any surgical procedure) include bleeding diatheses, chronic malnutrition, underlying severe disease/general debility, and unrealistic patient expectations.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe anatomy of the nose is complicated because of the intricate arrangement of shadowing concavities and light-reflecting convexities. The surgeon should be aware of the topographic anatomy and the internal anatomy of the nose before proceeding with any nasal reconstructive procedure. A review of nasal topography should be undertaken, and the surgeon should be acquainted with the concept of facial aesthetic units. The nose is made up of nine subunits; three are paired, and three are unpaired. The paired subunits include the two nasal ala, two soft tissue triangles, and two nasal sidewalls. The three unpaired subunits include the columella, tip, and dorsum. \n\nThe internal anatomy of the nose is also relevant to surgical success. Nasal musculature is not terribly important for functional purposes; however, this musculature can dilate the nares in times of extreme inspiratory need, and it can serve a purpose in defining the nasal valve mechanism. More importantly perhaps, the nasal musculature provides a luxurious source of perfusion for random pattern cutaneous flaps.\n\nFortunately, the arterial supply of nasal skin is redundant. The nose has an arterial supply from both the external carotid system (facial/angular artery) and the internal carotid system (ophthalmic artery branches in the area of the medial canthus). The underlying cartilaginous framework of the nose should also be reviewed before initiating any reconstructive procedure. This review has particular importance in the area of the middle/lateral nasal alae, as cartilaginous bolsters do not support potentially mobile alar margins. The lateral nasal alae can frequently be deformed during surgical reconstructive procedures that place even modest wound-closure tensions in directions that are not exactly parallel to the alar margins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Nonablative Facial Skin Tightening": "\nOverview\n\n\nReduction of rhytides and skin laxity can significantly contribute to improving overall facial appearance. Dermabrasion, chemical peels, and resurfacing lasers (eg, carbon dioxide laser, erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet [Er:YAG] laser) are the current mainstays of ablative facial resurfacing.\n [1]  During an ablative facial resurfacing process, the epidermis is denuded to a certain depth by the direct physical, chemical, or thermal injury applied to the skin.\nThe ablative cutaneous injury induces a healing response, resulting in the deposition of a new skin matrix with improved characteristics. During this so-called healing process, skin rejuvenation occurs by a proliferation of fibroblast activity, the action of inflammatory mediators, and a deposition of new collagen and other dermal matrix proteins.\n\n\nDespite achieving appreciable clinical results, the adverse effects of ablative resurfacing modalities can result in significant edema and erythema that last for several weeks. The potential for impressive clinical improvements must be balanced against well-described morbidities (eg, protracted edema and erythema), long-term sequelae (eg, pigmentary changes), and potential complications (eg, scarring). As such, the typical prolonged recovery times and the potential problems associated with these ablative modalities may also limit their use in patients who desire a rejuvenation procedure with reduced downtime and a minimal risk profile.\n [2, 3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Otoplasty": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe term otoplasty refers to surgical procedures designed to give the auricle a more natural and anatomic appearance. Otoplasty can be categorized as either cartilage splitting (cutting) or cartilage sparing. Cartilage-splitting techniques involve incisions through the cartilage and repositioning of large blocks of auricular cartilage. Cartilage-sparing techniques avoid full-thickness incisions, attempting to create more effective angles and curls in the cartilage. Most surgeons now perform cartilage-sparing otoplasty.\nCongenitally prominent ears are a cosmetic deformity that can have a severe emotional and behavioral effect on a child, although they typically do not affect a youngster's self-image until the child is older than age 5 or 6 years; surgery for prominent ears is best performed by age 6-7 years. Conversely, adult patients often seek otoplasty to correct a long-standing defect. Before surgery, patients typically style their hair to camouflage their deformity. Postoperatively, patients often feel comfortable enough to wear their hair short or combed back.\n\n\nIn 1845, Dieffenbach described correction of a posttraumatic auricular deformity. In 1881, Ely first described cosmetic otoplasty.\n [1] He performed a wedge excision of full-thickness skin and cartilage from the conchal bowl to reduce the prominence of the ear. Throughout the 1890s, numerous skin and cartilage excision techniques, aimed at reducing noticeable scarring, were used by Keen, Monks, and Cocheril. These procedures were further advanced during the first 2 decades of the 20th century by Morestin, who excised elliptical pieces of skin and cartilage in 1903; Luckett, who attempted to reconstruct the antihelical fold in 1910;\n [2] and Kolle, who contributed to mobilizing the \"springy shell of the ear\" by linear incisions in 1911.\nAn image depicting otoplasty landmarks can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtoplasty. Lateral auricular landmarks. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next 20 years, tissue grafting became a popular practice; however, according to Alexander (1928), Demel (1935), and Eitner (1937), each of whom used conchal excisions, sharp cartilaginous protrusions and wrinkling of the skin often remained.\n\nBy the 1940s, New and Erich used mattress sutures to maintain the stability of the antihelix and found that shaving the cartilage was just as adequate as excising whole fragments. The Mustarde technique, which uses permanent mattress sutures to maintain the superior crus, gained popularity in the 1970s because of its efficiency.\n [3] The use of permanent mattress sutures to re-create the antihelix remains in practice, as does postauricular soft-tissue excision for the correction of deformed auricles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Paramedian Forehead Flap Nasal Reconstruction": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe nose is a central, defining feature of the face, and abnormalities of the nasal structure are readily apparent even to an untrained observer.\n [1] Anatomically, the nose consists of a thin mucosal lining, sculptured alar tip cartilages, bone and cartilage braces that buttress the dorsum and sidewalls, and a thin vascular canopy of skin that matches the adjacent facial skin in color, texture, and hair-bearing quality. In nasal reconstruction, these normal anatomic parts must be considered, with the procedure replacing what been lost. Thus, restoration of the nose depends on the remaining degree of nasal coverage and support and the extent of lining loss. Additionally, nasal restoration must establish a nasal passage; avoid obstruction caused by soft tissue collapse, excess bulk, or a constricting scar; and create an aesthetically pleasing appearance.\nNasal reconstruction remains a challenge for plastic surgeons despite a number of described techniques and approaches. The reconstructive surgeon must not be bound to a certain technique but must instead consider the individual needs of the patient and the defect. Fortunately, nearby tissue in the form of the paramedian forehead flap provides a reliable source of like-tissue to transpose to the nasal defect. Therefore, the transfer of distant tissue is usually only necessary in complex cases requiring total nasal reconstruction.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Principles and Techniques of Nasal Reconstruction": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe history of nasal reconstruction mirrors the history of plastic surgery, beginning with what commonly is believed to be the earliest plastic surgery procedure recorded—nasal reconstruction by Sushruta in India during 600-700 BC, as reported by Rogers.\n [1] Reconstruction of the nose again emerged in 1597 when Tagliacozzi published a technique of a staged transfer of skin from the arm to rebuild the nose.\n [2] The emergence of these techniques in history undoubtedly is related to the savagery of hand-to-hand combat and the practice of cutting off the nose as a punishment for crimes.\nSince the 19th century, a variety of nasal reconstruction procedures that use local tissue from the nose, cheek, and forehead have been described. Reconstruction of the nasal skeleton using grafts from the nasal septum, ear, rib, hip, and calvaria also was introduced. Skin grafts were introduced in the 19th century as an option for defects with adequate soft tissue covering. The more recent development of the techniques of microsurgery, tissue expansion, and prefabricated flaps has added to the armamentarium of the plastic surgeon confronted with a complex nasal defect.\n\n\nThe contemporary plastic surgeon now has an almost bewildering number of reconstructive options from which to select. However, the rich history of nasal reconstruction is perhaps most impressive because the first procedure described, the midline forehead flap, remains a commonly used flap for nasal reconstruction.\n [3] \nSurgical anatomy\nThe nose is a composite tissue structure composed of the nasal skeleton, an internal lining of mucosa, and an external layer of skin. The topography of the external nose is a graceful blend of convexities, curves, and depressions that reflect the underlying shape of the nasal skeleton. These characteristics allow division of the nose into aesthetic subunits, described by Millard and modified by Burget: the tip and dorsum in the midline and the surrounding soft triangles, alar lobules, and lateral walls (see image below).\n [4, 5, 6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal aesthetic subunits. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nConsider the aesthetic subunits of the nose whenever planning a reconstruction. The borders of the subunits are an ideal location for the placement of scars, and an aesthetic subunit reconstructed with a uniform color and texture generally yields a superior result.\n\nNoel et al indicated that the hemitip should be included among the aesthetic subunits, stating that their retrospective study found that in most cases, when there is a defect on just one side of the tip, hemitip aesthetic subunit reconstruction is beneficial. The investigators also stated that a midline scar between the two hemitips is not easily seen.\n [7] \n\nThe nasal skeleton (see image below) is the supporting structure of the nose, and its integrity either must be maintained or restored for a successful reconstruction. It consists of the nasal bones and ascending processes of the maxilla in the upper one third, the paired upper lateral cartilages in the middle third, and the lower lateral, or alar, cartilages in the lower one third.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasal skeleton. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe upper lateral cartilages are attached tightly to the caudal edge of the nasal bones and the nasal septum, which allows them to remain suspended above the nasal cavity. The paired alar cartilages support the lower one third of the nose by uniting to form a tripod configuration.\n\nThe paired medial crura form the central leg of the tripod and are attached to the anterior nasal spine and septum in the midline. The lateral crura comprise the two lateral legs of the tripod, and they are attached firmly to the pyriform aperture. The dome defines the apex of the alar cartilage. It supports the nasal tip and is responsible for the light reflex of the tip.\n\nThe nasal lining consists of a thin layer of vascular mucosa. It tightly adheres to the deep surface of the nasal bones and cartilages. This dense adherence limits the mobility of the mucosa, and consequently only the smallest mucosal defects (< 5 mm) can be closed primarily.\n\nThe skin is the third and final layer of the nose. Proceeding inferiorly from the glabella, the skin thickness decreases and becomes progressively less distensible. The skin of the middle third of the nose over the cartilaginous dorsum and upper lateral cartilages is somewhat mobile, but at the distal third of the nose the skin tightly adheres to the alar cartilages, limiting its mobility.\n\nThe skin and underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semirigid unit that maintains the graceful curve of the alar rim and the patency of the anterior nares. To preserve this shape and patency, replacement of the alar lobule must include a cartilage graft for support, even though it does not contain cartilage in its native state.\n\nThe skin of the nose has a smooth and oily texture as a result of the high density of sebaceous glands. Compared to other areas of the face, the nose is forgiving with respect to scar formation, and it is perhaps second only to eyelid skin in its tendency to form fine, inconspicuous scars. The combination of favorable scar formation and the strategic placement of scars offers the plastic surgeon the opportunity for excellent results in nasal reconstruction.\n\nBasic principles\nBurget elegantly described the basic principles of nasal reconstruction in 1985.\n [5] They are extensions of the essential principles that define plastic surgery, and their observation provides the clearest path to outstanding results.\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoration of \"normal\"\n\n\n\nThe surgeon's ultimate goal should be to recreate the shadows, contours, color, and texture that define the normal nose at conversational distance (approximately 3 ft). However, this approach often leads to the selection of more complex procedures; this must be tempered by the needs and requests of the patient.\n\nConsider medical risk factors, especially when longer or multiple-stage procedures are contemplated. Also consider the patient's priorities. Ask each patient if he or she prefers a procedure that the surgeon believes produces the best aesthetic result, even if it is the most complex and riskiest, or if he or she prefers a simpler, low-risk procedure that may produce a lesser result. The answer to this question is quite revealing and helps guide the surgeon and patient in the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacement\n\n\n\nReplace missing parts with tissue that is like in quality and quantity. Replace nasal lining with lining, cartilage with cartilage, bone with bone, and skin with skin that is the closest match in color and texture. The author generally prefers skin flaps to skin grafts because they generally provide a superior match in color and texture, are resistant to contracture, and are able to provide vascular covering to the nasal skeleton.\n\nThe best source of nasal skin is nasal skin, when sufficient quantity exists. The use of nasal skin flaps should be a prime consideration, because the perfect color and texture match outweighs the disadvantage of additional scarring in most situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate\n\n\n\nThe template for replacing missing parts is the 3-dimensional configuration of the \"normal nose.\" Create this using a firm but malleable material; the foil of an empty suture packet is an ideal source.\n\nWith a partial defect, such as the alar lobule, the contralateral side becomes the model, and the foil is molded directly over the normal anatomy. For total nasal reconstruction, use a mental image obtained from continuous scrutiny of the \"normal nose\" in daily life to create a lifelike template.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin\n\n\n\nAt the skin level, replace entire aesthetic subunits whenever practical, even if it means enlarging the size of the defect. This principle allows the placement of scars that are less conspicuous, because they lie in the transition zone between adjacent aesthetic subunits. It also avoids the placement of two types of skin in the same subunit, which may be quite noticeable even when flaps are used.\n\nHowever, exercise this principle judiciously, weighing the advantages of scar placement and skin match against the additional flap or graft requirements and potential complications of a larger defect.\n\n\n\n\n\nScar placement\n\n\n\nPlace scars in the least conspicuous location possible.\n\nThis principle applies both to the borders of skin grafts and flaps and to donor site scars.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal stage\n\n\n\nAnticipate a final stage in which the subcutaneous tissue is sculpted to replicate the delicate configuration of the \"normal nose.\"\n\nMinor scar revisions also can be performed at this time when necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Varicose Veins": "\nOverview\n\n\nVenous insufficiency leading to varicose veins can be a serious, progressive process. When the refluxing circuit involves failure of the primary valves at the saphenofemoral junction, treatment options for the patient are limited, and early recurrences are the rule rather than the exception.\nSee Superficial Venous Insufficiency: Varicose Veins and Venous Ulcers, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify the common risk factors and features of this condition and its management options.\n\n\nIn the historical surgical approach, ligation and division of the saphenous trunk and all proximal tributaries was followed either by stripping of the vein or by avulsion phlebectomy. Proximal ligation requires a substantial incision at the groin crease. Stripping of the vein requires additional incisions at the knee or below and is associated with a high incidence of minor surgical complications. Avulsion phlebectomy requires multiple 2- to 3-mm incisions along the course of the vein and can cause damage to adjacent nerves and lymphatic vessels.\nEndovenous ablation has replaced stripping and ligation as the technique for elimination of saphenous vein reflux. One of the endovenous techniques is a radiofrequency-based procedure. Newer methods of delivery of radiofrequency were introduced in 2007. Endovenous procedures are far less invasive than surgery and have lower complication rates. The procedure is well tolerated by patients, and it produces good cosmetic results. Excellent clinical results are seen at 4-5 years, and the long-term efficacy of the procedure is now known with 10 years of experience.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] The original radiofrequency endovenous procedure was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 1999.\n\n\n\n\nEndovenous techniques (endovenous laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and endovenous foam sclerotherapy) clearly are less invasive and are associated with fewer complications compared with more invasive surgical procedures, with comparable or greater efficacy.\n [6, 7, 8, 9] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Random Skin Flaps": "\nOverview\n\n\nDefinitions\nA skin flap consists of skin and subcutaneous tissue that survives based on its own blood supply. Skin flaps are classified by the source and pattern of that blood supply.\n [1] The most basic skin flaps are based on the nonspecific, or \"random,\" blood supply of the subdermal plexus. For more information, see Tissue Flaps: Classification and Principles.\n\n\nIndications\nUse a skin flap for wound coverage when inadequate vascularity of the wound bed prevents skin graft survival. Use skin flaps for functional and cosmetic requirements for wound coverage on the face, particularly around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Skin flaps are indicated when specialized tissue is needed to cover gliding tendons, for bulk tissue to fill contour defects, and for specialized sensory function. A retrospective study by Haroon-Ur-Rashid et al found that distally based random skin flaps were effective in covering trauma-associated soft tissue defects over the upper two thirds of the tibia; the flap survived in all of the study’s 21 patients, although two patients suffered partial flap necrosis.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Rhinoplasty Tip Approaches": "\nOverview\n\n\nCorrection of the nasal tip is one of the most challenging aspects of rhinoplasty surgery, requiring the surgeon's ingenuity and flexibility. A study from the European Academy of Facial Plastic Surgery found that out of more than 41,000 rhinoplasties, performed in 33 countries, dissatisfaction with the nasal tip was one of the three most frequently reported indications for revision surgery, along with dorsal asymmetry and nasal blockage. Five percent of primary rhinoplasties in the study and 1% of secondary rhinoplasties underwent revision surgery.\n [1] \nEvery surgeon should master several techniques to modify the nasal tip, and tip modifications should be performed before alterations to the nasal hump are made.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  This sequence of surgery has been found to be advantageous because the removal of cartilage from the nasal tip that defines the tip also decreases nasal tip projection. Once the cephalad border of lower lateral cartilages is removed, the surgeon can perform nasal hump reduction by merely lowering the nasal dorsum to accommodate the new nasal tip projection.\n [8] \n\n\nThe two basic endonasal approaches to remodeling the tip cartilage are the intracartilaginous and infracartilaginous approaches. The intracartilaginous approach is the author's favored technique to produce a nasal profile in which the nasal tip stands out approximately 2 mm from the dorsal bridge line. This endonasal operation is unquestionably useful in managing the nasal tip in both primary and secondary rhinoplasty. The surgeon sees the result immediately. This approach involves good visualization, less edema, and no vascular issues that may interfere with the surgeon’s ability to evaluate the final result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Rhombic Flaps": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nA rhombic flap, used to repair rhombus-shaped defects, is a transposition flap, a type of flap that is useful when the size or shape of a lesion does not permit direct closure using a standard fusiform incision.\n [1, 2, 3] For example, attempting to close a wide defect primarily requires an ellipse with either long limbs or blunt angles. Lengthy limbs create long scars and remove healthy tissue unnecessarily, whereas blunt ends often create an unpleasant standing-cone or dog-ear appearance.\nA rhombus is classically defined as an oblique-angled equilateral parallelogram, whereas a rhomboid differs in that it has uneven adjacent sides. The term rhomboid is frequently used in facial reconstruction literature to mean either rhombuslike or to describe rhombic flaps.\n\n\nConsiderations when designing any local flap are lesion diameter, amount of normal skin that needs to be discarded, scar orientation with respect to relaxed skin tension lines, arc of skin rotation, and the vector of maximal tension after closure. Rhomboid flaps have been used in reconstruction of the cheek, temple, lips, ears, nose, chin, eyelids, and neck. The aesthetic and mechanical properties of these flaps, however, make them especially useful for reconstruction of small defects in the lower cheek, mid-cheek, and upper lip.\n [4] \nA study by Rashidian et al of 60 patients indicated that in the repair of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinuses, treatment with either simple primary closure or a rhomboid flap leads to faster complete wound healing and a lower frequency of postoperative infection and hemorrhage than does management in which the wound is left open.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Scalp Reconstruction Procedures": "\nOverview\n\n\nScalp surgery is performed on an increasingly frequent basis. This article emphasizes scalp surgery and reconstruction as they pertain to dermatologic surgery and surgery performed by primary care physicians. Extensive surgical procedures of the scalp, such as those involving free flaps, procedures that involve removal of the calvaria, and other extensive procedures, are not covered.\nCommon procedures performed on the scalp range from those that are medically indicated to those performed for cosmetic reasons. These procedures include incisional and excisional biopsies, excisions of benign and malignant tumors, and scalp reduction surgery.\n\n\nIncisional and excisional biopsies may be performed to aid in diagnosing benign and malignant lesions. Benign lesions include nevus sebaceous, epidermoid cysts, trichilemmal cysts, blue nevi, and melanocytic nevi. Malignant lesions include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, Merkel cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. Wounds created from these procedures may be superficial, as in the case of an incisional shave biopsy, or extensive, as in the case of a large excisional biopsy in which the site cannot be closed primarily.\nExcisions may be performed to diagnose and/or treat the conditions mentioned above. Wounds created from these procedures are generally full thickness and may extend to the calvaria.\n\n\n\n\nScalp reduction surgery was once performed to treat alopecia but is not commonly used today. Scalp surgery and reconstruction for cosmetic indications are not discussed here.\n\n\n\n\nReconstruction of the scalp after one of the above procedures may include any of the following techniques: granulation; side-to-side closure; the use of an advancement flap, rotation flap, or transposition flap; or the use of a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) or full-thickness skin graft (FTSG).\n [1, 2] \n\nThe selection of one or a combination of these methods depends on anatomic and patient-related factors. Anatomic considerations include the amount of local tissue laxity, the depth of the wound to be repaired, and the location of the wound. Patient-related factors include the patient's expectations, general state of physical and mental health, smoking status, and ability to care for the reconstructed wound.\n\nIn this article, each method of reconstruction is discussed in detail, with a review of its advantages and disadvantages, as well as ideal wound type and location, ideal patient type, and ideal technique for each method.\n\nAnatomy and general considerations\nFor the purposes of this article, the scalp is defined as the skin and underlying tissue layers that extend to the periosteum. From the skin inward, these layers are, in order, the skin (epidermis), cutis (dermis and subcutaneous tissue and fat), aponeurosis, loose areolar tissue, and periosteum. These layers can be easily remembered with the mnemonic SCALP.\n\nThe image below demonstrates several layers of the scalp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScalp anatomy, demonstrating the several layers. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe image below depicts arterial blood supply to the scalp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 5 pairs of arteries that supply the scalp. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAnteriorly, the scalp borders the forehead. The line that divides the scalp and forehead is located at the junction of the frontalis muscle and the aponeurosis. This line can be visualized by asking the patient to raise his or her eyebrows. The forehead has an appearance of rugae due to the contraction of the underlying frontalis muscle. Superior to the forehead, the scalp has a smooth appearance. This smooth appearance can be easily observed in patients with alopecia. For patients with hair, the hair can be parted to visualize this line.\n\nLaterally, the scalp borders the temples and auricles. The line that divides the scalp from the temple is located at the hairline. In patients with alopecia, the line is discerned by noting the transition from the increased amount of sebaceous glands and vellus hairs on the temple skin to the relative absence of those structures on the scalp skin. This line extends directly posteriorly from the temple, through the sideburn, to the superior border of the auricle. Correspondingly, the scalp occupies all the area above this line.\n\nPosteriorly, the scalp extends to the posterior border of the auricles. From there, it covers the back of the head and is separated from the posterior part of the neck by a line that runs directly along the posterior part of the hairline.\n\nThe scalp is commonly divided into sections and is named based on the underlying skull anatomy. These sections are the left and right frontal, parietal, vertex, and occipital scalp.\n\nThe greatest amount of scalp mobility occurs in the parietal regions where the temporal fascia overlies the temporalis fascia. Scalp mobility is decreased at the superior temporal septum in the lateral frontal region because of the adherence of aponeurotic layers to the pericranium. These ligamentous areas may need to be released to gain tissue movement from this area. The occipital region may also contribute tissue for reconstruction, but, often, wide undermining is required.\n\nThe best replacement for scalp tissue is scalp tissue. No other site can approximate the same hair-bearing qualities of the scalp. Hair transplantation may be used to restore hair-bearing areas and is most effectively used as a secondary procedure to camouflage scars or reestablish hairlines.\n\nPatients who have received radiation therapy to the scalp may have tissue that is fibrotic, resulting in decreased mobility and hardiness of flaps.\n\nIn hair-bearing areas of the scalp, incisions made parallel to the direction of hair growth may improve cosmesis because fewer follicles are disrupted. Extensive tension at wound closure may result in hair loss. Appropriate attention to obtaining closure with as little tension as possible is very important. Understanding the properties of stress relaxation and creep facilitate tension-free closures. Stress relaxation is the decrease in the amount of force needed to maintain a fixed amount of stress over time. A certain amount of relaxation occurs as tissue creeps. Stress relaxation allows large lesions in inelastic areas to be removed by serial excision. Creep is gain in skin surface area that results when a constant load is applied. An increase in length occurs as compressed tissue displaces interstitial fluid. Both stress relaxation and creep are time dependent properties of the skin.\n\nThe galeal aponeurosis also hinders flap movement. Scoring the galea in the direction of desired flap movement may result in additional tissue gain. The galea is incised at 1-cm intervals and checked for adequate mobility after each incision.\n\nFlap methods\nTo create flaps, nearby redundant tissue is used to close a wound. However, the scalp usually does not have a significant amount of redundant or loose tissue to mobilize for wound closures. In general, flaps have limited applications in larger wounds on the scalp, although they may be used more often in smaller wounds.\n\nFlaps discussed in this article are categorized as random pattern flaps. While the blood supply to these flaps comes from their pedicles, the blood supply to the pedicle comes from the random vascular supply in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat. Random pattern flaps are distinguished from interpolated flaps, which derive their blood supply from a named vessel.\n [3] \n\nIn choosing between advancement, rotation, and transposition flaps, one must usually consider where nearby redundant tissue reservoirs and cosmetic subunit junctions are located. With knowledge of these areas, one may then choose the type of flap that most efficiently permits access to and use of the nearby redundant tissue with the placement of incision lines within or along cosmetic subunit junctions to leave the most cosmetically acceptable scar.\n\nRusso elucidated a “1-2-3 rule” for helping to select the most effective means of reconstructing moderate-sized scalp defects. In a retrospective study of patients who had undergone excision of a cutaneous scalp tumor and whose defect could not be managed by simple direct suture, he found that if the defect’s edges were 1-2 cm apart, a single relaxation incision was required for reconstruction. Two incisions were needed for an edge distance of 2-3 cm, and three incisions were required when the edges were 3-4 cm apart.\n [4] \n\nIn a retrospective study of patients who underwent scalp reconstruction following oncologic ablation, Janus et al found higher complication rates in association with larger or deeper defects and in patients who had received preoperative radiation therapy or were immunosuppressed. The single-institution study, which had a mean follow-up period of 2.4 years, involved 139 patients, with reconstruction techniques in the report ranging from granulation to free tissue transfer.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Simplified Vertical Breast Reduction": "\nOverview\n\n\nVarious approaches to breast reduction have been attempted to combine the safety of the pedicle with the appeal of the short-scar techniques. No one method is best, but the ability to use different approaches in different situations can expand the breast reduction and mastopexy repertoire of the plastic surgeon.\n [1, 2] The key is to realize that the pedicle, the skin-resection pattern, and the parenchymal-resection pattern must all be viewed separately. The phrases vertical and inverted-T apply to the skin resection pattern. Both approaches can use different pedicles and different parenchymal resection patterns.\nVertical breast reduction follows the basic principles of plastic surgery, with a complete dermoglandular pedicle (rather than a dermal pedicle) and no skin undermining. Flap thickness and outward beveling are used to preserve the blood supply. This technique relies on breast resection and suturing for shaping and not on skin tension for shape maintenance.\n\n\nSimplified vertical breast reduction is a variation on the vertical technique that uses a full-thickness medial pedicle for nipple circulation and breast shaping and resection of a vertical (not horizontal) wedge of tissue to improve the initial result and provide a long-lasting shape. The procedure is simple, fast, reproducible, and reliable. The learning curve is relatively short, and the improved results are well worth the change from the reliable inferior pedicle inverted-T techniques to the medial-pedicle vertical technique, in terms of both scarring and shape.\nHistory of the Procedure\nVertical reduction mammaplasty techniques have only recently achieved a measure of acceptance in North America.\n [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] Although the desire to eliminate some of the extensive scarring of the anchor-shaped techniques is certainly strong, most surgeons are still not willing to compromise their comfort with the safety of the inferior pedicle technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of the superior pedicle in the initial vertical techniques that Lassus\n [3, 4, 5] and Lejour or Lejour et al\n [7, 8, 9, 10] describe prevented wide acceptance of the vertical approach. The superior pedicle can be difficult to inset; either the pedicle needs to be thinned to allow it to be folded into place, or the blood supply is at risk because of vascular kinking or compression. Thinning may improve circulation by avoiding compression, but the ability to retain sensation or allow for breastfeeding is reduced.\n\nDifferent pedicles have been described over the years, including the lateral pedicle,\n [14, 15] the horizontal bipedicle and the lateral pedicle,\n [16, 17, 18] the vertical bipedicle,\n [19, 20] the inferior pedicle,\n [21, 22, 23] and the superior pedicle.\n [24] All these pedicles were used with the anchor-shaped reduction techniques while surgeons in Europe\n [14, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 10] and in South America\n [25, 26, 27, 28] tried techniques that reduced scarring. However, the inferior-pedicle and central-mound techniques\n [29, 30] had proven so reliable and safe that surgeons in North America were reluctant to switch to a method that they thought was riskier, even though scarring could be reduced. Hammond has combined the vertical approach (circumvertical) with an inferior pedicle,\n [11] but surgeons are still reluctant to switch away from the inverted-T inferior pedicle technique.\n\nProblem\nSurgeons initially believed that they had to choose between an improved shape and an improved scar.\n [31] However, many practitioners started to realize that both the shape and the scars could be improved and that some vertical techniques improved the longevity of the shape.\n\nAlthough many surgeons started using the vertical approach because of the reduced scarring, it has become clear that the key is about concepts not scars. Reduced scarring is only a small part of the appeal. Improvement occurs because the parenchymal (and skin) resection is performed through a vertical ellipse. The breast is coned rather than being pushed up and flattened by a horizontal ellipse. This coning improves projection. The vertical elliptical excision also means that the lateral and medial parenchymal pillars are brought together; the resultant healing process holds the shape in the long term.\n\nThe inverted-T techniques usually rely on the skin brassiere to shape the breast, whereas the vertical techniques usually use the breast to shape the skin. Medial-pedicle vertical breast reduction also leaves the tissue attached to the skin superiorly, and the heavy inferior breast tissue is removed. The skin is then allowed to conform to the new shape.\n\nWith many of the inverted-T inferior-pedicle techniques, the surgeon undermines the skin to remove the superior tissue, leaving the heavy inferior breast tissue behind. This tissue is then pushed up by tightly closing the skin horizontally. Skin (dermis) is an elastic structure that stretches. Therefore, the fact that the vertical incision stretches with inverted-T techniques and that the tissue bottoms out is not surprising. By comparison, medial-pedicle vertical reduction uses the healing of the relatively inelastic medial and lateral pillars to hold the shape. No tension is applied to the skin. The best results are also achieved when very little tension is applied to the parenchymal closure.\n\nRelevant anatomy\nThe breast is a superficial ectodermal structure, and most of its blood supply is superficial. The breast is a skin structure that is relatively mobile on the chest wall. It is attached to the skin at the nipple level. The breast is held in place on the chest wall not by deep attachments but by the skin structures of the inframammary fold and the sternum. The upper and lateral breast borders are not held in place in the same way. The illustration below depicts the anatomy of the breast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nArterial input comes from the medial perforators of the internal thoracic system, from the thoracoacromial system, and from the lateral thoracic system. These vessels are deep at their origin and become progressively superficial as they reach the breast mound. An arterial system also comes from the internal thoracic vessels, which run beneath and then perforate the pectoralis muscle around the fourth interspace. This system supplies an inferior or central pedicle and is accompanied by veins. The rest of the arteries are superficial and do not have venae comitantes. The venous system is also superficial and can be seen just below the dermis separate from the arteries.\n [32] \n\nThe superior pedicle is supplied from a strong medial vessel from the second or third interspace. It is superficial by the time it reaches the center of the breast. For this reason, a superior pedicle can be easily and safely thinned. The medial pedicle is supplied from medial vessels from the third to fifth interspaces. The pedicle may appear to be superomedial when the patient is standing, but the blood supply is medial. The medial pedicle can be thinned.\n [33] The author likes to use a full-thickness medial pedicle for both innervation and breastfeeding potential.\n\nThe breast can be visualized as a cylinder, especially when the patient leans forward and the breast hangs. Regardless of the level on the cylinder at which breast tissue is removed, the distance around the circumference of the cylinder should be the same. This means that the vertical limb of the breast reduction should be manageable at any size. On the converse, if the pedicle is to be retained, the large (ie, long-cylinder) breast has a long pedicle, which makes reducing lower-pole fullness more difficult. As with most breast reductions, small reductions often give the best cosmetic results.\n\nSensation in the nipple-areola complex is an important consideration. Inferior- and central-pedicle reductions often maintain good sensation, and free nipple grafts result in permanent loss of sensation. Surgeons are taught that the main sensation comes laterally from the fourth intercostal nerve.\n [34] Therefore, a lateral-pedicle technique should result in better sensation than is present after a superior- or medial-pedicle technique is used. However, sensation comes from several directions.\n\nSurgeons in Austria\n [35] demonstrated that the deep branch of the lateral fourth intercostal nerve runs across the breast just above the level of the pectoralis fascia until the mid portion of the breast, where it then runs superiorly toward the nipple. Because the pectoralis fascia is not exposed and because the pedicle is full thickness, this anatomy explains why the medial-pedicle technique maintains sensation as good as that associated with the lateral-pedicle technique.\n\nThinning of a pedicle likely reduces breastfeeding potential. The medial pedicle used in this technique is full thickness. About 60% of patients can breastfeed, with 25% needing to supplement.\n [36] Of interest, the same statistics also apply to large-breasted women whether or not they undergo breast-reduction surgery.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Breast Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Skin Flap Design": "\nOverview\n\n\nReconstruction of facial defects is a challenging endeavor. Successful reconstruction requires a thorough understanding of skin anatomy and physiology, careful analysis of the defect, thoughtful consideration of multiple options for donor tissue, and skillful and meticulous soft tissue–handling techniques.\nOptions for reconstruction are generally classified using the “reconstructive ladder,” proceeding from least invasive to most invasive in terms of morbidity. At the bottom of the ladder is secondary intention healing in which defects granulate over a period of weeks in a moist, semi-occlusive environment. Other options for facial reconstruction include grafts, local flaps, and free tissue transfer. When planned and executed properly, local skin flaps allow for rapid reconstruction with a reliable and adequate blood supply and a good skin color/texture match. The goal of this section is to outline the use of local skin flaps for facial reconstruction.\n\n\nThe subunit principle is well recognized as the starting point in the analysis of facial defects (see the image below). With the subunit principle, skin color, texture, and thickness, as well as hair growth and surrounding contours at subunit junctions are considered; these features can provide optimal camouflage for incisions and transition. The subunit principle is only a starting point, but it is the foundation for adequate reconstruction of facial defects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facial subunits. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo single flap is optimal for every defect. Each defect must be individually analyzed for depth, distortion of surrounding subunits, and normal tissue available for reconstruction. On the basis of this analysis, the appropriate flap or combination of flaps is chosen. Facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons must be aware of the entire armamentarium of local flaps so that they can more easily visualize the various combinations of flaps and predict their success. Mastery of the use of local flaps requires the ability to predict long-term results and anticipate inevitable scarring and contracture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Skin Tissue Expansion": "\nOverview\n\n\nTissue expansion has become a major reconstructive modality over the past 30 years. It has become more and more widespread, particularly in the fields of breast reconstruction, burn surgery, and pediatric plastic surgery.\n [1, 2] In many cases, tissue expansion can be said to have revolutionized plastic surgery.\nThe lack of available soft tissues is a common challenge facing the reconstructive surgeon. The phenomenon of tissue expansion of the skin and underlying soft tissues has been observed commonly in pregnancy, slow-growing tumors, and fluid collections, where the local tissue expands and enlarges in response to the tension generated by the increased volume of the mass. This response has been found to be a metabolically active process with increased mitotic activity and vascularity of the expanded skin and has been applied clinically as an important skill in the armamentarium of the reconstructive surgeon.\n [3] \n\n\nTissue expansion has numerous advantages. While it provides skin with a near-perfect match in color and texture, minimal donor site morbidity and scarring occur.\n [4, 5, 6] It also can be used in various parts of the body to provide tissue with specialized sensory function or adnexal characteristics. Examples include the superior sensation of the skin flaps in breast reconstruction and the hair-bearing flaps designed in the treatment of male pattern baldness developed with expanders.\n [7, 8] In addition, expanded flaps are more resistant to bacterial invasion than random cutaneous flaps.\n [9] This technique has been extended to other types of tissue, including bladder reconstruction, vascular elongation, and nerve lengthening.\nDisadvantages include temporary cosmetic deformity during the expansion phase, prolonged period of expansion, the need for multiple procedures, and complications associated with the implant and placement.\n\n\n\n\nPhysiology\nTissue expansion induces changes in the vascularity and cellular activity in involved skin. Alterations in microcirculation have been shown to create hardier flaps in expanded versus nonexpanded skin. Histologic evidence supports expansion as a type of delay. Cherry and others showed that in the animal model, expanded skin demonstrated increased vascularity on microangiography. These flaps had significantly increased survival length when compared with acutely raised random-pattern flaps.\n [3] The capsule that forms around the prosthesis is involved in the increased vascularity and has been shown to have a circulation exceeding that of the subdermal plexus.\n [10] Removal of this capsule compromises the integrity of the expanded tissue, so it is often unnecessary and sometimes risky.\n\n\n\n\nStudies of the skin surrounding an expander indicate that the epidermis initially thickens slightly while the dermis demonstrates rapid thinning during the first 3 weeks.\n [11] Skeletal muscle atrophies under expansion but retains its activity. However, adipose tissue undergoes permanent atrophy of 30-50% with loss of fat cells.\n [12, 13] \n\nIncreased epidermal mitotic activity demonstrated by Austad and others and increased numbers of radiolabeled keratinocytes suggest that new skin elements form in the expanded flaps. When compared with intraoperative tissue expansion as described by Sasaki, tissue expansion over a period of several weeks attains nearly 4 times the surface area and 3 times the arc of rotation.\n [14] Intraoperative expansion depends on the viscoelastic properties of skin in response to load cycling.\n [15] This increase in length in response to an applied force is known as \"creep\" and is distinct from the biological response of the replicating epidermal cells noted in animal model flaps developed over several weeks. Austad and others concluded that this was consistent with a net \"dividend\" of tissue gained.\n [16] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Split-Thickness Skin Grafts": "\nOverview\n\n\nSkin transplanted from one location to another on the same individual is termed an autograft. These grafts consist of the entire epidermis and a dermal component of variable thickness.\n [1, 2] If the entire thickness of the dermis is included, the appropriate term is full-thickness skin graft (FTSG). If less than the entire thickness of the dermis is included, this graft is referred to as a split-thickness skin graft (STSG). STSGs are categorized further as thin (0.005-0.012 in), intermediate (0.012-0.018 in), or thick (0.018-0.030 in), based on the thickness of the harvested graft. Based on reconstructive needs, STSGs meeting the above criteria can be readily harvested using commercial dermatomes.\nAnatomy\nSkin covers the entire external surface of the human body, representing the largest single organ. The integument acts as a protective barrier from environmental insults including trauma, radiation, harsh environmental conditions and infection. Other functions include thermoregulation (through sweating, vasoconstriction or vasodilatation) and control of insensible fluid loss. Restoration of an intact skin barrier is of utmost importance following wounding to prevent infection, minimize wound contraction to maintain function, and minimize cosmetic disfigurement and to avoid volume depletion. Skin grafting was first performed in India 2000 years ago but widespread interest did not develop until the 19th century. Skin grafting currently represents the most rapid, effective method of reconstructing large skin defects.\n\n\nA thorough understanding of pertinent skin anatomy is required to perform a skin graft. The skin consists of 2 layers, the epidermis and dermis. The epidermis is stratified squamous epithelium, consisting primarily of keratinocytes in progressive stages of differentiation from deeper to more superficial layers. The epidermis is subdivided into 4-5 layers, depending upon the anatomic location. These include the stratum basale (basal layer), stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum. The stratum corneum represents a significant protective barrier from the external environment and prevents desiccation of the skin. Melanocytes are found in the stratum basale and are responsible for an individual’s skin color. Of note, the epidermis has no blood vessels, so it must receive nutrients by diffusion from the underlying dermis.\n\n\n\n\nThe dermis is a more complex structure and is composed of 2 layers, a superficial papillary dermis and deeper reticular dermis. The papillary dermis is thinner, consisting of loose connective tissue containing capillaries, elastic fibers, reticular fibers, and some collagen. The epidermis articulates with the papillary dermis by way of a series of invaginations, Rete pegs, that strengthen the cohesion between these layers.\nThese pegs become blunted with age, increasing the risk of shear injury to the skin.\n [3] The reticular dermis consists of a thicker layer of dense connective tissue containing larger blood vessels, closely interlaced elastic fibers, and coarse branching collagen fibers arranged in layers parallel to the surface. The reticular layer contains fibroblasts, nerve endings, lymphatics, and epidermal appendages. Surrounding the components of the dermis is the gel-like ground substance, composed of mucopolysaccharides (primarily hyaluronic acid), chondroitin sulfates, and glycoproteins.\n\n\n\n\nEpidermal appendages play a critical role in re-epithelialization after epidermal or superficial dermal injury, including healing of split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites. Injuries that ablate these structures or underlying conditions that interfere with their function (Accutane treatment) increase the risk of cosmetically and functionally poor wound healing. These intradermal epithelial structures (sebaceous glands, sweat glands, hair follicles) are lined with epithelial cells that have the potential for division and differentiation. They are often found deep within the dermis. In the face, they may lie in the subcutaneous fat beneath the dermis, which accounts for the remarkable ability of the face to reepithelialize even the deepest cutaneous wounds.\n\nSebaceous glands (holocrine glands) secrete sebum that serves to lubricate the skin and make it more impervious to moisture. They are found over the entire surface of the body, except the palms and the soles and dorsum of the feet. They are largest and most concentrated in the face and scalp, where they are an anatomic focus for the development of acne.\n\nSweat glands (eccrine glands) are found over the entire surface of the body, except the lips, external ear canal, and labia minora. They are most highly concentrated in the palms and soles of the feet. The normal function of these glands is to produce sweat, which cools the body by evaporation. Apocrine glands are similar in structure to eccrine glands. They are concentrated in the axilla and anogenital regions. They probably serve a vestigial sexual function because they produce odor and do not function prior to puberty. The hair follicle is another important source of epithelial cells, and many of the other dermal appendages actually open into the hair follicle, rather than directly onto the skin.\n\nThe skin varies in thickness based on its anatomic location and the sex and age of the individual. Skin is thickest on the palms and soles of the feet, while the thinnest skin is found on the eyelids and in the post-auricular region. Male skin characteristically is thicker than female skin in all anatomic locations. Children have relatively thin skin that progressively thickens until the fourth or fifth decade of life, when it begins to atrophy. This thinning is primarily a dermal change, with loss of elastic fibers, epithelial appendages, and ground substance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Tattoo Lasers": "\nOverview\n\n\nTattoos are an ancient art form with origins that trace back as far as the Stone Age (12,000 BCE). Tattoos have remained popular throughout time and across many cultures and continents. Although most psychological studies of persons with tattoos have been restricted to psychiatric inpatients, prisoners in correctional institutions, and military personnel (thus reflecting only specific populations), one common conclusion is that, of all the motives for obtaining a tattoo, the quest for personal identity is central. The skin serves as a useful canvas on which to portray statements of individuality, sexuality, belonging, machismo, frustration, boredom, and anger. However, the quest for identity by teenagers often becomes irrelevant or embarrassing by age 40 years, and 50% or more of individuals later regret their tattoos.\nEgyptian mummies from 4000 BCE show evidence of attempts at tattoo removal. However, since most people live in the present moment, rather than in anticipation of future endeavors, tattoos remain popular. Unpublished data from the Candela Laser Corporation indicate that, in the United States, 9-11% of men have tattoos and 50,000-100,000 women actively pursue tattooing as body art each year. In general, tattoos are not well received by the public and often create a barrier to employment. Individuals with tattoos are often perceived as antisocial, aggressive, or immature and as being unable to accept controls and authority.\n\n\nThere are many additional motivations for tattoo removal, including the end of a romantic relationship, poor tattoo quality, the desire to end affiliation with a legitimate or criminal organization, and the elimination of branding tattoos by sex trafficking survivors.\n [1]  \nSee the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaser tattoo removal.

        "Tumescent Liposuction": "\nOverview\n\n\nTumescent liposuction involves the use of tumescent anesthetic and microcannulae. The small cannulae form tunnels in the subcutaneous tissue and allow for more effective and less traumatic fat removal than the large cannulae.\nLiposuction is the most commonly performed cosmetic procedure in the United States. It is also referred to as liposculpture, lipoplasty, and suction-assisted lipectomy. The ideal candidate is physically fit and eats well-balanced meals but is unable to reduce a fatty deposit that is well localized and often seems to involve a genetic susceptibility.\n\n\nIn the past, the surgery required blood transfusions because blood loss in the aspirate was significant. Dr Jeffrey Klein, a dermatologic surgeon, is credited as the originator of the tumescent technique, which has allowed liposuction to be performed with the patient under local anesthesia while minimizing blood loss and the risks of general anesthesia. Since its inception, liposuction performed with the tumescent technique has had an excellent safety profile.\n [1] \nHistory\nIn 1921, Dujarrier, a French surgeon, curetted a ballerina's knees to create a better shape, but the patient developed gangrene and required an amputation. In 1964, Schrudde developed curettage and suction. Georgio and Arpad Fischer, Italian surgeons, developed cannulae and an internally rotating planatome and cellusuctiontome. Other cannulae were developed by Kesselring and Meyer and Illouz, the latter also developed the wet technique. Fournier favored the syringe technique and instructed physicians to use the cross-tunneling technique. The dry technique uses general anesthesia without any preoperative infiltration of vasoconstrictive solution. The wet technique achieves a moderate reduction in blood loss by using a small amount of epinephrine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDermatologic surgeons began performing liposuction since its evolution, and the number of dermatologists performing liposuction increased as studies showed the safety provided by the tumescent technique and the physiologic basis for the benefit of the procedure. As the number of cases performed increased, surveys of physicians corroborated its safe track record.\n\nFuture directions\nFuture uses of liposuction may involve the harvesting of stem cells for facial revolumization, as well as other uses for stem cells, such as in the treatment of urinary incontinence and hair regrowth.\n [2] \n\nAdvantages\nThe several advantages of the tumescent approach include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nLess blood is lost.\n\n\n\n\nIntravenous fluid replacement is not necessary.\n\n\n\n\nBacteriostatic lidocaine may decrease the risk of infections.\n\n\n\n\nTumescence magnifies defects; therefore, the likelihood of needing a secondary procedure may be less.\n\n\n\n\nLipid-soluble lidocaine is somewhat suctioned out with the aspirated fat.\n\n\n\n\nVasoconstriction minimizes absorption.\n\n\n\n\nThe epinephrine may increase the cardiac output, which, in turn, hastens the hepatic metabolism of the lidocaine.\n\n\n\n\nThe duration of anesthetic effect may last as long as 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\nThe lidocaine may be given safely up to 45 mg/kg and even higher in certain conditions.\n\n\n\nA small study by Lipp et al, surveying and following up on 32 patients, indicated that tumescent liposuction produces safe, long-lasting results. At follow-up (mean overall follow-up 8.9 years; neck follow-up 9.9 years), a surgeon evaluator observed significant differences in neck volume (2.42 vs 0.71) and in skin laxity scales (1.17 vs 0.83 for laxity and 1.31 vs 0.83 for firmness). A blinded evaluator also determined differences on the laxity scales (1.14 vs 0.77 for laxity and 1.33 vs 0.75 for firmness). The investigators found that 85.7% of patients surveyed “would recommend liposuction to their friends and family members.”\n [3] \n\nAlternatives\nCryolipolysis\n [4] (Zeltiq, California) involves freezing the fat at a temperature that is above the freezing point of skin. A 1-hour cycle of freezing can reduce, at 4 months, the volume of fat by 20%. Secondary treatments can be performed 1-4 months after the first treatment. Multiple applicators overlapping the fat bulge have been shown to produce some very good results, at times similar to liposuction but without any surgery.\n\nRecently, external laser (SculpSure, Cynosure), ultrasound (UltraShape, Syneron Candela) and radiofrequency (Venus Freeze, Venus Concept) technologies were cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for noninvasive fat reduction.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Varicose Vein Treatment With Endovenous Laser Therapy": "\nOverview\n\n\nChronic venous disorders (CVDs) of the lower extremity are common problems caused by venous hypertension, which is commonly the result of reflux in one or more of the saphenous veins and their primary tributaries. Treatment options in patients with saphenous vein incompetence include conservative management or elimination of these incompetent pathways using endovenous techniques or surgery.\n [1] The image below depicts varicose vein before treatment with endovenous laser therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaricose vein before treatment with endovenous laser therapy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nSee Superficial Venous Insufficiency: Varicose Veins and Venous Ulcers, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify the common risk factors and features of this condition and its management options.\nAlthough conservative management with compression therapy may improve the symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency, it does not cure it. Historically, surgery was considered the best way to eliminate incompetence using ligation of the saphenous vein at its deep vein junction and removal of the abnormal saphenous vein segments; this procedure is known as high ligation and stripping (HL/S). Over the last 10-15 years, HL/S has been essentially replaced by percutaneous endovenous thermal ablation. Two types of thermal ablation procedures exist: endovenous laser ablation (ELA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Both procedures are associated with high success and low complication rates. The procedures are generally performed on an ambulatory basis with local anesthetic and typically require no sedation. The patients are fully ambulatory following treatment, and the recovery time is short. In this article, ELA is reviewed in detail.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nELA mechanism of action\nThe underlying goal for all thermal ablation procedures is to deliver sufficient thermal energy to the wall of an incompetent vein segment to produce irreversible occlusion, fibrosis, and ultimately disappearance of the vein. The mechanism of vein wall injury after ELA is controversial. It has been postulated to be mediated both by direct effect and indirectly via laser-induced steam generated by the heating of small amounts of blood within the vein.\n [3] Adequately damaging the vein wall with thermal energy is imperative to obtain effective ablation. Some heating may occur by direct absorption of photon energy (radiation) by the vein wall, as well as by convection from steam bubbles and conduction from heated blood. However, these later mechanisms are unlikely to account for most of the impact on the vein.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nDiode lasers are most commonly used for ELA. Laser generators exist with multiple different wavelengths, including lower wavelengths that are considered hemoglobin specific and include 810 nm, 940 nm, 980 nm, and 1064 nm. Higher wavelengths are considered water specific and include 1320 nm and 1470 nm. Although it is still not definitively established in the literature, some authors suggest that the higher wavelength lasers produce similar efficacy at lower power settings with less postprocedure symptoms.\n [5] \n\nIt can be performed with multiple different laser fiber designs (ie, bare-tip fibers, jacket-tip fibers [see image below], radial fibers) and diameters available from a variety of vendors. Each of the fiber designs has been demonstrated to be effective in closing the saphenous vein. At this point, there are no conclusive data demonstrating a superiority of a given fiber, wavelength and energy deposition combination, efficacy, significant adverse effects, or complications as metrics for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture of a jacket-tip laser fiber.

        "Z-Plasty": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nZ-plasty is a common plastic surgical technique that at its core trades a shorter, simpler scar for a longer, more complex one. When the skin is undermined, 2 triangular flaps are created. Transposition of these triangles redistributes tension on the wound and changes central limb direction. The new scar elongates based not only on the character and elasticity of the surrounding skin but also on the angle size used in the Z-plasty.\nThe decision to utilize a Z-plasty must take into account the increased length and complexity of the scar, and this must be a worthwhile tradeoff in improving an existing scar.\n\n\nZ-plasty is one of many techniques for scar revision and camouflage. It produces a type of transposition flap that incorporates qualities of advancement and rotation flaps into its design. Whether used alone or in conjunction with other scar-camouflage techniques, Z-plasty is a versatile maneuver that, when mastered, provides aesthetically pleasing results.\n [1, 2] \nIn 1856, Denonvilliers first described the Z-plasty technique as a surgical treatment for lower lid ectropion. The first reference to this technique in American literature was in 1913, by McCurdy, as treatment for contracture at the oral commissure. Limberg, in 1929, provided a more detailed geometric description. Numerical data showing optimal angles and length relationships of Z-plasty limbs are credited to Davis (1946).\n\n\n\n\nThe image below depicts a Z-plasty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original scar is A-B.

        "Abdominal Stab Wound Exploration": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn the 19th century, penetrating abdominal wounds were managed nonoperatively. The associated morbidity and mortality rates were greater than 70%.\n [1] Experience gained during World War I, World War II, and the Korean Conflict led to an aggressive approach of operative management for all penetrating abdominal wounds.\n [2] This approach resulted in an unacceptably high frequency of laparotomy with findings negative for trauma. In 1960, Shaftan developed an approach of selective conservatism for penetrating abdominal injury and revolutionized abdominal stab wound management.\n [3] \nInvestigators in this field continue to study various protocols and investigative tools. Despite impressive advances in investigative techniques, the optimal method to determine the need for laparotomy has yet to be definitively established.\n [4] \n\n\nThe objective is to reduce the number of patients with trivial or no intraperitoneal injury who are subjected to laparotomy. However, a high degree of diagnostic accuracy must be maintained to limit the frequency of missed injury. A reduction in unnecessary hospitalization is also targeted.\nIn patients with stab wounds to the anterior abdomen who lack signs of obvious peritoneal penetration, the following two methods are widely used to help determine the need for laparotomy:\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdominal stab wound exploration (subsequent diagnostic peritoneal lavage [DPL], serial clinical evaluation, or both are used to further assess patients in whom an exploration cannot definitively exclude peritoneal penetration.)\n\n\n\n\nSerial clinical evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther modalities that have been studied include DPL alone, CT, diagnostic laparoscopy, and ultrasonography or FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma).\n [5, 6] These strategies of selection for laparotomy are explored in greater detail below.\n\nAbdominal stab wound exploration forms part of a strategy developed by surgeons to allow a more selective approach. It is a safe, rapid, and cost-effective tool in the management of asymptomatic patients who present with an anterior abdominal stab wound.\n [7, 8] This approach has no place in the treatment of patients who are unstable, who have peritonitis, or who have evisceration. Patients with peritonitis and those who are hemodynamically unstable should undergo mandatory laparotomy.\n\nThe authors advocate abdominal stab wound exploration in patients who present with an anterior abdominal stab wound without hemodynamic instability or obvious signs of peritoneal cavity violation. An exploration with negative findings is reliable and highly sensitive.\n [9, 10] More than 25% of anterior abdominal stab wounds do not penetrate the peritoneal cavity.\n [8, 11, 12] A wound exploration that demonstrates an intact posterior rectus fascia (superior to the arcuate line) or transversalis fascia (inferior to the arcuate line) allows the safe discharge of these patients from the emergency department.\n [13] \n\nOnly half of the wounds that penetrate the peritoneum cause damage that requires surgical intervention.\n [1, 9, 14] Abdominal stab wound exploration combined with further investigation, such as DPL or serial evaluation, achieves acceptable specificity rates. The organs most commonly injured with anterior abdominal stab wounds are the small bowel, the liver, and the colon. Missed hollow viscus injuries are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Minimizing the time taken to control ongoing intraperitoneal contamination is critical in penetrating stab wounds, and local exploration is a valuable first step in speeding up the decision-making process. When combined with DPL, abdominal stab wound exploration allows significant injuries that are not immediately apparent to be identified early.\n\nWound exploration can be performed successfully by surgeons or emergency department personnel, provided they are trained in the procedure. This strategy aids with patient flow through a busy emergency department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Axillary Dissection": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nAxillary dissection is a surgical procedure that incises the axilla to identify, examine, or remove lymph nodes. Axillary dissection has been the standard technique used in the staging and treatment of the axilla in breast cancer. Patients presenting with symptomatic early breast cancer have a 30-40% chance of having positive axillary nodes and 20-25% chance if presenting through a screening program.\n\n\nStaging of the axilla is an important step in the treatment of breast carcinoma. Axillary lymph node status is a significant prognostic pathologic variable in patients with operable primary breast cancer, and it remains the most powerful predictor of recurrence and survival. The number of lymph nodes with metastasis also has prognostic importance.\n [1, 2] \nAxillary dissection was first advocated as part of the treatment of invasive breast cancer in the 18th century by Lorenz Heister, a German surgeon.\n [3, 4, 5] In modern practice, the role and benefits of axillary dissection have been influenced by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project B-04 trial,\n [6] which concluded that axillary dissection has no effect on survival. However, other studies provided substantial evidence that axillary dissection provides excellent local control of disease in the axilla, with a local recurrence rate of 2% or less,\n [7, 8] which may lead to improved overall survival.\n [9, 10] \n\n\n\n\nIndications\nAxillary dissection should be reserved for patients with proven axillary disease preoperatively or with a positive sentinel node biopsy.\n\n\n\n\nAxillary dissection is only therapeutic in patients who are node positive. Therefore, performing axillary dissection in all patients would lead to an overtreatment of at least 60% of patients who are all node negative. The introduction of sentinel-node biopsy has changed the approach to the axilla, as the status of the axilla can be established with less morbidity for patients when compared with complete axillary dissection.\n\nThere may be a gradual shift away from carrying out an axillary clearance in patients with positive sentinel nodes. A trial (AMAROS), presented at the Annual Meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology, compared the use of axillary radiotherapy with axillary clearance in patients who had a positive sentinel node and found no significant difference in disease-free or overall survival, but reduced lymphedema rates in the radiation group.\n\nResults from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Trial (Z0011) reported patients without clinical or radiological evidence of axillary metastases undergoing breast-conserving surgery having whole-breast radiotherapy, with positive sentinel nodes, did not achieve any further oncological benefit by having axillary clearance.\n\nThere is an increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer, and the optimal timing of sentinel node biopsy can be controversial. Axillary dissection is advocated for all patients who complete neoadjuvant treatment to down-stage the breast tumor, except when sentinel node biopsy is negative and undertaken prior to the neoadjuvant treatment.\n\nSentinel node biopsy prior to chemotherapy could be considered the most accurate staging assessment of the axilla, while some would argue that performing the sentinel node biopsy after chemotherapy could allow patients who have had a complete pathological response to be spared the increased morbidity of an axillary clearance.\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network/American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines still recommend axillary clearance in patients with micrometastatic disease in sentinel nodes, but the benefit of carrying this out routinely has been questioned following studies showing no significant difference in axillary recurrence or survival for patients having sentinel node biopsy only versus completion axillary clearance.\n\nContraindications\nAxillary clearance has no absolute contraindications. As with any elective surgical procedure, patients must be medically optimized and suitable for general anesthesia.\n\nThe argument for carrying out axillary dissection in the presence of distant metastases is controversial but may have a role in obtaining locoregional control, if required.\n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nPatients with advanced disease in the axilla with palpable axillary nodes, if proceeding to surgery, generally do not require cytological/histological confirmation of nodal involvement.\n\nUltrasound assessment of the axilla in combination with either fine needle aspiration or core biopsy can detect a positive axillary node in a large proportion of node-positive cases. This positive preoperative axillary status allows women to proceed directly to axillary dissection, avoiding sentinel node biopsy.\n\nPatients who preoperatively have no evidence of axillary disease should undergo a sentinel node biopsy and have axillary dissection carried out if the sentinel node is positive. This can be carried out during the index operation if the sentinel node can be analyzed intraoperatively using frozen section, imprint cytology, or molecular-based assays.\n\nProcedure Planning\n\nThe axilla is a quadrangular space that lies between the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lower border of the axillary vein superiorly\n\n\n\n\nThe chest wall medially\n\n\n\n\nThe axillary skin laterally\n\n\n\n\nPectoralis major and minor anteriorly\n\n\n\n\nLatissimus dorsi, teres major, and subscapularis posteriorly\n\n\n\nAxillary dissection removes all the nodes and fat from this space. Although the nodes are in a continuum, the clearance can be anatomically divided into three levels based on the relationship of the tissue to the pectoralis minor muscle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Breast Biopsy With Needle Localization": "\nDetection of Breast Lesions\n\n\nAs breast cancer screening with mammography increases, many impalpable breast lesions are being detected.\n [1] These lesions should first and foremost be definitively diagnosed by using image-guided needle biopsy. Thus, breast biopsy with needle localization is used for the diagnosis of impalpable breast lesions. After needle biopsy, some of these lesions may require diagnostic or therapeutic surgical biopsy. If a malignant or indefinite diagnosis is obtained, surgical excision is indicated. This, in turn, requires accurate localization of the lesion, which is required to ensure correct and adequate removal of the lesions and to minimize the degree of cosmetic disfigurement.\n [2] \nThe following images depict the localization of masses on mammograms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast biopsy with needle localization.

        "Breast Stereotactic Core Biopsy/Fine Needle Aspiration": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe establishment of national breast-screening programs in Europe and North America led to an increase in the detection of small or impalpable breast lesions. The ability to achieve an accurate histopathologic diagnosis of these lesions is crucial to any screening program in terms of appropriate treatment planning and patient counseling.\nStereotactic breast needle biopsy refers to the sampling of nonpalpable or indistinct breast lesions by using techniques that enable the spatial localization of the lesion within the breast. The word stereotactic is derived from Greek and Latin roots meaning \"touching in space.\" Stereotactic techniques have evolved in parallel with the trend in breast conservation and minimally invasive surgery.\n\n\nIn the past, impalpable breast lesions would have been surgically excised after needle localization, resulting in a vast number of surgeries for nonmalignant mammographic abnormalities. In the United States, it is estimated that more than a million surgical breast biopsies are performed, and in only 15%-30% are the samples subsequently found to be malignant.\nRole of stereotactic needle biopsy\nCompared with open surgical biopsy, needle biopsy causes less trauma and disfigurement and is performed as an outpatient procedure with the patient under local anesthetic.\n [1]  Stereotactic needle biopsy is an important tool in the diagnosis of breast lesions as part of the triple assessment, which includes clinical, radiologic, and cytohistopathologic studies.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitively diagnosing these lesions with needle biopsy has several advantages. For benign lesions, establishing a definitive diagnosis obviates unnecessary surgical excision or protracted follow-up, both of which are costly in psychosocial and resource terms.\n [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  A definitive diagnosis of cancer allows the patient to make an informed choice and to obtain counseling before surgery. It also facilitates in the planning of multimodal treatment in terms of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the type of procedure, and early or delayed reconstruction.\n\nThe importance of achieving preoperative diagnosis is further emphasized in the quality objectives of the United Kingdom's national breast-screening program to minimize unnecessary benign surgical biopsy and to ensure that more than 70% of women with cancer have a preoperative diagnosis.\n [7] \n\nTechniques and principles of stereotaxis\nBecause most of the lesions detected during screening are impalpable, subsequent needle biopsy must be image-guided. Ultrasonography-guided biopsy is usually the most straightforward approach, but lesions better seen on mammography images, particularly microcalcifications, require stereotactic localization.\n\nThe principles of localization involve mapping the distance between the geometric center of the breast with the target lesion in two different planes and then projecting the coordinates onto the patient's breast (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStereotactic images obtained during a prone-table biopsy procedure. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nEarlier techniques in stereotaxis used mammographic projections to localize the target lesion within the breast. Advances in digital mammography have since superseded manual computations. Dedicated stereotactic equipment that performs localization with fixation of the breast is now in use (see image above).\n [8, 9, 10, 11]  Stereotactic techniques have also been developed within other imaging modalities, including ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These techniques offer more options and greater flexibility in performing stereotactic biopsy.\n\nDigital tomosynthesis creates a three-dimensional (3-D) picture of the breast using x-rays. It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but it is not yet considered the standard of care for breast care screening and is only available in limited hospitals. It takes multiple x-ray pictures of each breast from many angles. The breast is positioned in the same way as conventional mammography but with limited pressure. The x-ray tube moves in an arc around the breast while numerous images are taken within a few seconds. The information is then relayed to a computer, which generates highly focussed 3-D images throughout the breast.\n\nIn 2013, Hologic Inc launched the world's first 3-D breast biopsy option \"Affirm 3D\". The procedure can be of benefit in targeting lesions that cannot be easily detected on two-dimensional (2-D) imaging or when using other modalities. It is claimed to also target lesions faster and reduce patient procedure time.\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nThe breast is made up of fatty tissue and glandular, milk-producing tissues. The ratio of fatty tissue to glandular tissue varies among individuals. In addition, with the onset of menopause (ie, decrease in estrogen levels), the relative amount of fatty tissue increases as the glandular tissue diminishes.\n\nThe base of the breast overlies the pectoralis major muscle between the second and sixth ribs in the nonptotic state. The gland is anchored to the pectoralis major fascia by the suspensory ligaments first described by Astley Cooper in 1840. These ligaments run throughout the breast tissue parenchyma from the deep fascia beneath the breast and attach to the dermis of the skin. Since they are not taut, they allow for the natural motion of the breast.\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Breast Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Burn Resuscitation and Early Management": "\nBackground\n\n\nBurn resuscitation refers to the replacement of fluids in burn patients to combat the hypovolemia and hypoperfusion that can result from the body’s systemic response to burn injury.\n [1] \nThe history of modern burn resuscitation can be traced back to observations made after large urban fires at the Rialto Theatre (New Haven, Conn) in 1921 and the Coconut Grove nightclub (Boston, Mass) in 1942. At the time, physicians noted that some patients with large burns survived the event but died from shock in the observation periods. Underhill and Moore identified the concept of thermal injury–induced intravascular fluid deficits in the 1930s and 1940s, and Evans soon followed with the earliest fluid resuscitation formulas in 1952.\n [2, 3] Up to that point, burns covering as little as 10-20% of total body surface area (TBSA) were associated with high rates of mortality. Through the 1970s, even a 30% TBSA burn was associated with nearly 100% mortality in older patients. See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLund-Browder chart. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\nSee Thermal Injuries: A Matter of Degree, a Critical Images slideshow, to help identify and treat various types and degrees of burn injuries.\n\n\n\n\nOver the next 50 years, advances in resuscitation further expanded these observations and led to numerous strategies to treat burn shock.\n [4] The prognostic burn index (PBI), a crude estimate of mortality involving adding age + TBSA has steadily improved to the point that a PBI score of 90-100 (predicting near certain mortality) now demonstrates mortality rates of 50-70% in adult burns. Nearly 13,000 annual hospital admissions are attributable to burns, and almost a dozen deaths per day result from residential fires. Children younger than 5 years and adults older than 65 years have a mortality from burns that is 6 times the national average.\n [5, 6, 7] \n\n\n\n\nFor patient education resources, see the First Aid and Injuries Center as well as Thermal (Heat or Fire) Burns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Cervical Lymphadenectomy": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nLymphadenectomy is the surgical removal of one or more groups of lymph nodes. It is almost always performed as part of the surgical management of cancer. In the treatment of head and neck cancer, 3 areas must be addressed: the primary site, the neck, and the sites of distant metastasis. Of these, disease in the neck is the least straightforward. Even when there is no clinical or radiologic evidence of disease in the neck, 20-30% of patients may still harbor occult metastasis. In particular, cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis are the most likely sites to have neck disease at presentation. Neck disease reduces survival rates for head and neck cancers by half. Therefore, control of the neck is of utmost importance in the successful management of these cancers.\nThere are 2 major modalities used to address the neck: surgical cervical lymphadenectomy with or without postoperative radiation therapy or radiation therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy. Surgery provides precise pathologic staging of the neck and can also provide definitive treatment.\n [1, 2, 3] \n\n\nTechnical Considerations\nComplications and their prevention are described below.\n\n\n\n\nRecurrence in the neck\n\n\n\n\nFactors negatively influencing the rate of recurrence include extracapsular spread (macroscopic extracapsular spread portends a worse prognosis than microscopic extracapsular spread), the number of lymph nodes involved, the number of lymph node levels involved, and perineural invasion.\n\nAdjuvant radiation therapy improves the rate of control in the neck.\n\nShoulder dysfunction\n\nSacrifice of the spinal accessory nerve results in denervation of the trapezius muscle and sternocleidomastoid as well as destabilization of the scapula. The patient experiences significant shoulder pain, weakness in abduction of the shoulder past 30 degrees­­, shoulder drop, and a winged scapula.\n\nStudies have shown that any type of neck dissection can result in shoulder dysfunction, regardless of whether the spinal accessory nerve is preserved. However, dysfunction is more frequent and severe for patients in whom the spinal accessory nerve is either resected or extensively dissected along its length from the skull base to the trapezius muscles. Shoulder dysfunction is also more likely be temporary in those who have less extensive spinal accessory nerve dissection.\n [4] \n\nInadvertent injury to the spinal accessory nerve can occur in several situations. The spinal accessory nerve can sometimes lie superficial enough in the posterior triangle to be at risk during elevation of skin flaps. Dissection immediately along the anterior border of the trapezius muscle can injure branches of the spinal accessory nerve as they dive toward the deep surface of the muscle. Also, during excisional biopsies of the posterior triangle, the spinal accessory nerve can be found to run directly over the enlarged lymph node.\n\nDuring fine-needle biopsy of the posterior triangle, the use of local anesthesia may eliminate spinal accessory nerve function so that the trapezius muscle does not contract upon penetration, and shoulder dysfunction can go unrecognized for hours until the anesthesia wears off.\n\nHematoma\n\nPronounced postoperative swelling of the neck flaps may indicate a hematoma. If aggressive milking of the drains does not alleviate the problem immediately, then the patient should return to the operating room for a neck exploration, evacuation of the hematoma, and control of possible hemorrhage.\n\nFailure to recognize a hematoma may result in postoperative wound infection and poor wound healing.\n\nChylous fistula\n\nIn order to avoid a chyle leak, it is important to avoid injury to the thoracic duct when dissecting inferomedially in the left neck. In addition, be sure to ligate any potential tributaries to the thoracic duct, and remember that the thoracic duct can be multiple in its course. Keeping a relatively bloodless field can be very helpful in accomplishing these goals. Also, before closing the wound, reinspect the wound bed for a possible leak. Increasing intrathoracic pressure for 20-30 seconds can aid in identifying possible leaks. Remember that chyle is not milky in fasting patients who have received nothing orally for 8-12 hours.\n\nChakedis et al noted the utility of indocyanine green with near infrared imaging in the identification of the thoracic duct in 6 left lateral neck dissection (level II-IV) cases.\n [5] \n\nEven if all precautions are taken, 1-2% of patients undergoing neck dissections will develop a chylous fistula.\n\nHigh-output fistulas (greater than 600 mL chyle per day) require return to the operating room for neck exploration, drainage of chyle, and control of the chyle leak.\n\nLow-output fistulas or those that become apparent only after the patient begins enteral feeding may be managed conservatively at first with drains, pressure dressings, and a low-fat diet. If this fails to alleviate the problem, then parenteral nutrition can be considered prior to returning to the operating room.\n\nFacial/cerebral edema\n\nIf both internal jugular veins are sacrificed, the patient is at risk for facial and/or cerebral edema.\n\nFacial edema may resolve over time as collateral circulation develops. Edema is more common and more severe in patients who have a history of radiation therapy and in those who undergo pharyngectomies. Facial edema can be prevented by preserving at least one external jugular vein.\n\nPatients in whom bilateral radical neck dissections are performed are at risk for cerebral edema and subsequent neurologic dysfunction. Increased intracranial pressure resulting from bilateral internal jugular vein sacrifice may cause a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and subsequent extracellular fluid expansion and hyponatremia, worsening the neurologic effects. Thus, perioperative fluid management in these patients must be cautious and cannot depend on urine output as a sole indicator but must take into consideration central venous pressure, cardiac output, and serum and urine osmolarity.\n\nBlindness\n\nBlindness is a rare but catastrophic event after bilateral neck dissection. It is presumed to be a result of intraoperative hypotension in addition to insufficient venous drainage.\n\nCarotid artery rupture\n\nCarotid artery rupture is more likely to occur in the following settings:\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor planning of skin incisions\n\n\n\n\nFistula formation or flap breakdown\n\n\n\nIncisions should not expose the carotid artery directly, and any trifurcations should be well away from this region.\n\nFistula formation and flap breakdown are more common in the setting of previous radiation, poor nutrition, diabetes, and wound infection. Fistulas tracking over the carotid artery are at high risk of carotid artery rupture. To prevent this complication in patients with risk factors, careful closure of mucosal defects is of utmost importance. The use of free and pedicled vascularized flaps provides skin for closure of these defects and has greatly reduced the incidence of this potentially lethal complication.\n\nShould a pharyngocutaneous fistula form, large defects with high-output fistulas, especially in previously irradiated patients, are unlikely to heal. The patient should be taken to the operating room for a repair of the fistula and coverage of the carotid artery with a vascularized flap.\n\nIf a carotid artery rupture occurs, immediately apply manual pressure. Administer fluids and blood products to maintain hemodynamic stability. Carotid artery stenting can provide a temporizing measure before ligation of the artery. Prior to this, a balloon occlusion test may provide key information as to whether the patient would be able to tolerate a complete ligation. Repair of the ruptured segment is generally futile. Therefore, the definitive management requires ligation of the carotid artery both proximal and distal to the site of rupture.\n\nGreater auricular nerve injury\n\nThe greater auricular nerve provides sensation to the auricle. This nerve can often be preserved in selected neck dissections, but sacrifice is well tolerated, and this nerve is routinely sacrificed by many surgeons.\n\nFacial nerve dysfunction\n\nThe cervical branch of the facial nerve is commonly sacrificed during neck dissections with minimal sequelae. When the skin flaps are being elevated, the mandibular branch of the facial nerve is commonly encountered, and every attempt is made to preserve it. Injury to this nerve will cause weakness of angular depression of the lips along with obvious lower lip and commissural asymmetry.\n\nHypoglossal nerve dysfunction\n\nThe hypoglossal nerve exits near the jugular foramen, passes deep to the internal jugular vein, then passes superficial to the internal and external carotid arteries as it gives off a branch to the ansa cervicalis that lies on the carotid sheath. It then travels across the floor of the submandibular triangle parallel to the submandibular duct and passes deep to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle before entering into the tongue musculature.\n\nThis nerve can be injured during indiscriminate clamping of the venous plexus posterior and inferior to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle or during dissection of the floor of the submandibular triangle. Occasionally, it can be adherent to the submandibular duct due to reactive fibrosis.\n\nBrachial plexus injury\n\nThe brachial plexus is at risk during dissection of the posterior triangle (level V). It can be found exiting between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, deep to the posterior belly of the omohyoid muscle and transverse cervical artery. Injury can cause a combination of upper extremity numbness and weakness.\n\nPhrenic nerve injury\n\nThe phrenic nerve is also at risk during dissection of the posterior triangle (level V). It runs across the superficial surface of the anterior scalene muscle just anterior to the brachial plexus and underneath the transverse cervical artery.\n\nThis nerve can be inadvertently injured during removal of the cervical plexus in radial and modified neck dissections when the dissection is carried too deep in the plane above the scalene muscles. Be sure to keep the plane of the dissection above the fascia of the scalene muscles, dividing the cervical nerves only after they exit the plexus and enter the specimen.\n\nInjury to the phrenic nerve will cause hypoventilation of the affected lung, leading to pulmonary compromise, atelectasis, and a high risk for pulmonary infection.\n\nHorner syndrome\n\nThe sympathetic chain is located in the prevertebral fascia posterior and deep to the carotid sheath. Avoid dissecting deep to the carotid artery, as injury to the sympathetic chain may result in Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nRelevant Anatomy\nRelevant anatomy and clinical significance are presented in the table below.\n\n\n\nTable.

It is enveloped by mucosa and contains glands, sensory organs, and four pairs of extrinsic muscles. The tongue is essential for several important functions, including jaw articulation, taste, manipulation of food, swallowing, and the production of speech. See image below.\n\n\n\n\n\nTongue anatomy in cross-section. The epithelial surfaces comprise the mucosa. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nFrom anterior to posterior, the tongue has 3 surfaces: tip, body, and base. The tip is the highly mobile, pointed anterior portion of the tongue. Posterior to the tip lies the body of the tongue, which has dorsal (superior) and ventral (inferior) surfaces. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Tongue Anatomy.\nInjuries to the tongue are often treated in the emergency department or other acute care settings. A tongue laceration is often the result of a fall, seizure, psychogenic nonepileptic seizure, or other blunt or penetrating force mechanism.\n [1, 2, 3] Piercings, intoxication, and iatrogenic cause are also commonly associated with tongue injury.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] Case studies have also implicated dystonia, self-mutilation, anesthesia, and exploding electronic cigarettes.\n [13, 14, 15, 16] Lacerations secondary to seizures are most often found to the side of the tongue.\n [17, 18] \n\n\n\n\nBecause of the tongue’s generous blood supply, most tongue lacerations do not become infected and many heal well without repair. The tongue hypertrophies to rebulk itself in a period of 6 months, so even loss of lateral tongue and tip often produces no permanent deficit.\n [19] However, repair is required when the injury has certain characteristics (see Indications).\n\n\n\n\nThe goals of laceration repair of the tongue are to attain adequate closure, stop bleeding, minimize complications, preserve mobility, and optimize articulation and deglutition.\n\nWhile uncommon, practitioners should keep in mind that such injuries can be the result of physical abuse.\n [20, 21, 22] Oral and facial trauma occur in 50% of abused children.\n [23] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Dermoscopy": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe widely used acronym ABCDE (asymmetry, irregular borders, multiple colors, diameter >6 mm, enlarging lesion) contains the primary clinical criteria for diagnosing suspected cutaneous malignant melanoma. The early phase of malignant melanoma is difficult to identify because cutaneous malignant melanoma can share many clinical features with an atypical nevus. Several studies have described diagnostic accuracy rates ranging from 50-75%, indicating a need for additional diagnostic tools. The introduction of dermoscopy, also termed epiluminescence microscopy (ELM), has opened a new dimension in the examination of pigmented skin lesions and, especially, in the identification of the early phase of cutaneous malignant melanoma.\nDermoscopy is a noninvasive method that allows the in vivo evaluation of colors and microstructures of the epidermis, the dermoepidermal junction, and the papillary dermis not visible to the naked eye. These structures are specifically correlated to histologic features. The identification of specific diagnostic patterns related to the distribution of colors and dermoscopy structures can better suggest a malignant or benign pigmented skin lesion. The use of this technique provides a valuable aid in diagnosing pigmented skin lesions. Because of the complexity involved, this methodology is reserved for experienced clinicians.\n\n\nVestergaard et al have reported dermoscopy assessment is more accurate than clinical evaluation by naked eye for the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma (odds ratio = 15.6, P = .016). In this study, the mean sensitivity in the diagnosis of melanoma was 74% for the examination by naked eye and 90% for dermoscopy.\nThe equipment; technologic methods; diagnostic features; and primary aspects of melanoma, common nevi, atypical nevi, and other nonmelanocytic pigmented skin lesions are discussed in this article. The technique is also commonly used to assist in the evaluation of nail fold capillaries and features of alopecia.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

These methods involve high-frequency alternating current, which is converted to heat by resistance as it passes through the tissue.\n [1] The result of heat buildup within the tissue is thermal tissue damage. These modalities are commonly used for hemostasis, debulking procedures such as rhinophyma excision, and treatment of benign and malignant skin conditions ranging from acrochordons (skin tags) to basal cell carcinoma (BCC).\n [1] \n\n\nElectrocautery is a form of direct transference of heat to tissue. Instead of passing electrical current through the tissue, the current is used to heat a handheld element, which is then applied to the tissue. This form of electrosurgery is most commonly used for hemostasis and tumor destruction when high-frequency electrosurgery is contraindicated.\nAdditional modalities of electrosurgery include electrolysis, which uses a chemical reaction created by direct current to damage tissue, and coblation, used for facial rejuvenation, which uses an electrical current to ionize a conduction medium such as isotonic saline.

        "Emergency Escharotomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nEscharotomy is the surgical division of the nonviable eschar, the tough, inelastic mass of burnt tissue that results from full-thickness circumferential and near-circumferential skin burns. The eschar, by virtue of its inelasticity, results in the burn-induced compartment syndrome. This is caused by the accumulation of extracellular and extravascular fluid within confined anatomic spaces of the extremities or digits. The excessive fluid causes the intracompartmental pressures to increase, resulting in collapse of the contained vascular and lymphatic structures and, hence, loss of tissue viability. The capillary closure pressure of 30 mm Hg, also measured as the compartment pressure, is accepted as that which requires intervention to prevent tissue death.\nThe circumferential eschar over the torso can lead to significant compromise of chest wall excursions and can hinder ventilation. Abdominal compartment syndrome with visceral hypoperfusion is associated with severe burns of the abdomen and torso. (A literature review by Strang et al found the prevalence of abdominal compartment syndrome in severely burned patients to be 4.1-16.6%, with the mean mortality rate for this condition in these patients to be 74.8%.\n [1] ) Similarly, airway patency and venous return may be compromised by circumferential burns involving the neck.\n\n\nEscharotomy allows the cutaneous envelope to become more compliant. Hence, the underlying tissues have an increased available volume to expand into, preventing further tissue injury or functional compromise (see image below).\n [2] For more information on burn treatment, see the Medscape Drugs & Diseases article Burn Rehabilitation and Reconstruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nEscharotomy to release the chest wall and allow for ventilation of the patient. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscharotomy is considered an emergent procedure in burn treatment protocols.

        "Fasciotomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nFasciotomy is a clinical procedure indicated once the clinical diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made. This article focuses on the treatment of acute compartment syndrome. Also see the article Fasciotomy for Acute Compartment Syndrome.\n\n\nCompartment syndrome results from the combination of increased interstitial tissue pressure and the noncompliant nature of the fascia and osseous structures that make up a fascial compartment.\n [1] Severe complications following compartment syndrome were first described in 1881 by Richard Van Volkmann after he noted that interruption of the blood supply to the flexors in the forearm secondary to supracondylar fractures resulted in paralysis and contracture of the affected muscle group.\n [2] \nA fasciotomy consists of 1 or more fascial incisions and remains the only effective way to treat acute compartment syndrome.\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of timely evaluation and clinical suspicion is based on the sequelae of compartment syndrome. Nerve conduction can be negatively affected after 2 hours of ischemia\n [2] ; however, if compartment syndrome is diagnosed and treated within 6 hours of onset, overall functional impairment is unlikely.\n [2]  One study found only a 8% rate of regained limb function with fasciotomies performed after 12 hours of onset.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\nKey considerations\nFascial compartments are defined by unforgiving connective-tissue septa and osseous structures. Without sufficient compliance of these structures, pressure increases within the closed system, causing microvascular compromise and subsequent muscle and nerve ischemia.\n [1] \n\nCompartments that have the least baseline compliance are those that are most likely to develop compartment syndrome. This is the case for the anterior and deep posterior compartments of the leg. Although it most commonly (40%) occurs in the compartments at the level of the tibia and fibula,\n [2, 4, 5] compartment syndrome is seen anywhere muscle groups are enclosed as described above, including the buttocks and lumbar paraspinous muscles.\n [1, 6] \n\nDiagnosis of compartment syndrome can be made by clinical examination or with more objective measures such as compartment pressures. Although absolute compartmental pressures are often used for fasciotomy decision making, the difference between the compartment pressure and diastolic pressure (Δ p), has been associated with an increased accuracy in diagnosing compartment syndrome and is particularly useful in the multitrauma patient. Multitrauma patients can become hypotensive and therefore create an environment in which the development of compartment syndrome can occur at lower pressures and confound diagnosis of compartment syndrome in these clinical scenarios.\n [7] A high clinical suspicion for compartment syndrome along with serial examinations without the use of compartment pressure measurements is still used in many settings today.\n\nPredictors for fasciotomy after arterial trauma may include male sex, lower extremity injury, Rutherford grade III or higher, and an ischemia duration of greater than 2.5 hours.\n [3, 8]  \n\nIndications\nIndications for surgical intervention in acute compartment syndrome in the alert patient are generally based on clinical impression.\n [9] Four signs and symptoms are commonly referred to as the four Ps, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pain that is out of proportion to clinical findings\n         \n\n\n\n          Pain with passive stretch of involved muscles\n         \n\n\n\n          Pain with palpation of involved compartment\n         \n\n\n\n          Pressure increase within the compartment as measured\n         \n\n\nCertainly, all of these signs do not need to be and are often not present in the setting of acute compartment syndrome. A pulseless extremity more likely reflects large vessel injury as a very late finding in compartment syndrome and may not develop at all despite protracted elevated pressures.\n\nIn a patient who cannot express pain or paresthesias, serial clinical examinations along with monitoring of compartment pressure can play a more important role in the diagnosis.\n\nThe pressure point at which fasciotomy should be considered is not a specific value, although a compartment pressure of 30 mm Hg is a commonly cited value. Masquelet notes that whenever diastolic pressure minus tissue pressure (Δ p) is less than 30 mm Hg, fasciotomy is indicated.\n [10] \n\nContraindications\nFasciotomy is contraindicated when diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made late. Fasciotomy 3-4 days after onset of compartment syndrome can lead to infection and kidney failure in a setting of devascularized and necrotic muscle (see the image below).\n [11]  If a fasciotomy is performed more than 12 hours after onset of compartment syndrome, then reperfusion injury becomes a risk.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyonecrosis. Excised muscle from a patient with a femur fracture and compartment syndrome of the leg that was released more than 10 hours from onset. Patient went on to an above-the-knee amputation. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nEtiology\nMany factors play a role in the development of compartment syndrome, including vascular injuries, soft tissue trauma, and systemic hypotension in the patient with a traumatized extremity.\n\nMost commonly, acute compartment syndrome is secondary to trauma such as fracture, arterial injury, physical compression, or burn.\n [12] However, postoperative hematoma, tight-fitting casts, and infiltration of fluids through an intravenous catheter, as well as a multitude of other issues, have also been described in association with compartment syndrome (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhabdomyolysis: 31-year-old dehydrated and overweight female with sickle cell trait presented with bilateral thigh and leg compartment syndrome after military physical training (PT) test. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nPathophysiology\nInterstitial pressures increase within a compartment, and, as it reaches and exceeds venous pressure, venous outflow is halted, causing further increase in intracompartmental pressures. This results in a shunting of blood flow away from the injury and toward areas of lower vascular resistance. In this environment, muscle cells are unable to adapt to the decreased oxygen tension that is secondary to the increased tissue pressures.\n\nThis cycle propagates itself and cell death–induced metabolic changes contribute to the hypoxia, further increasing pressure. Knowing the pressure at which this cycle is initiated has been the goal of many studies, and although no incontrovertible value has been identified, compartmental pressures measuring 30 mm Hg or more are understood to often require surgical intervention (see the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrush injury to the hand created pressures high enough to result in muscle extrusion from the adductor compartment and tearing of the skin over the palm. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Hair Tourniquet Removal": "\nBackground\n\n\nHair tourniquet syndrome is a rare clinical phenomenon that involves hair, thread, or similar material becoming so tightly wrapped around an appendage that it results in pain, injury, and, sometimes, loss of the appendage.\n [1] Essentially, any appendage may be involved, including a toe, wrist, penis, scrotum, tongue, uvula, vaginal labium, ear lobe, umbilicus, or nipple.\n [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] In a meta-analysis review of 210 cases of hair-thread tourniquet syndrome, 44.2% involved the penis, 40.4% the toes, 8.6% fingers, and another 6.8% represented other sites.\n [7] \nHuman hair is extremely thin and, hence, easily overlooked, especially when a patient presents with a foreign body reaction and local swelling.\n [8] Once constricted over an appendage, reepithelialization may occur if the offending fiber is not removed in a timely fashion. This may further obscure the hair or thread below an overlying skin bridge, making recognition more difficult.\n [9] Hair has high tensile strength and the ability to stretch when wet and contract or tighten as it dries.\n [8] The wrapping of the offending fiber or hair around a digit is thought to be caused by repetitive movement of the appendage in a confined area, such as hands in mittens or feet in pajamas.\n [10] The tissue injury from constricting bands may be caused by ischemic compression of blood vessels and the direct cutting action of the tourniquet.\n [9] In addition to soft-tissue damage, this mechanism is even capable of disrupting bone.\n [7] Complications such as constrictive scarring, flexion deformity, and even urocutaneous fistulae may affect healing post release.\n [11] \n\n\nMost cases of hair wrapping occur in young children. The most often observed age range of reported cases of finger wrapping is in the first days of life up to 19 months, and penile involvement is 4 months to 6 years.\n [12] Labial and clitoral wrapping have been described in an older age group (age 7-13 years).\n [13] Case reports have documented 80- and 84-year-old men with involved extremities.\n [14, 15] Hair tourniquet syndrome can be observed across all ages. The younger age group, especially infants younger than 4 months, is thought to be more at risk because 90% of mothers experience excessive postpartum hair loss, called telogen effluvium.\n [16] Most cases of hair tourniquet syndrome are deemed accidental, but intentional cases consistent with child abuse have been cited in the literature.\n [17] \nAlthough the affected patient can present in several ways, the classic presentation is that of the inconsolable infant. The diagnosis can be made after identification of a swollen and painful appendage with sharp circumferential demarcation from normal tissue proximally. Hair tourniquet syndrome confers an inherent risk of loss of function and autoamputation. However, it is easily treatable and long-term effects are largely preventable with prompt diagnosis. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when confronted with such presentations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Ingrown Toenail Removal": "\nOverview\n\n\nIngrown toenails (onychocryptosis, unguis incarnatus) are frequently encountered in both general practice and specialty clinics, and, thus, a fundamental level of understanding of the development and management of the condition, including knowledge of the nail anatomy, is useful.\nThe nail plate, or the nail proper, consists of the body, which is the exposed portion, and the root, which is the proximal portion covered by a fold of skin called the eponychium. The cuticle is the most distal edge of the eponychium. The nail plate rests on a continuation of the stratum germinativum, called the nail bed. The nail walls are the segments of skin that overhang the lateral edges of the nail, which attach within the sterile matrix. The germinal matrix runs from an area just distal to the lunula to several millimeters proximal and deep to the eponychium. The germinal matrix is likely solely responsible for longitudinal growth of the nail. See Nail Anatomy for more information.\n\n\nThe presence of a lateral projection of nail growing into the periungual soft tissue, commonly believed to be the sole etiology of ingrown toenails, is likely only one of several factors in the development of the condition. Although any toenail can become ingrown, the vast majority occur on the great toe.\n [1] Extrinsic compression on the great toe by footwear places constant pressure directly on the medial nail wall and indirectly on the lateral wall as the toe is pushed against the second toe. In the presence of a nail that is cut inappropriately short along the lateral portion, the nail fold is irritated or penetrated, which allows colonization of bacterial and fungal skin flora. Inflammatory changes, including edema, erythema, and pain, occur as an abscess forms. With the formation of hypertrophic granulation tissue, the toe is increasingly exposed to compression and irritation, creating a vicious cycle.\nSome have suggested that people who are susceptible to onychocryptosis have an excessive amount of tissue along the lateral nail folds. Weight-bearing results in tissue bulging over the sides of the nail, which is theorized to cause pressure necrosis.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nIn the early stages of inflammation, attempts at nonsurgical management may be attempted. Treatment consists of gently dislodging the lateral edge of the nail plate from the inflamed nail fold into which it is embedded, followed by placement of sterile nonabsorbent gauze or cotton under the sharp corner of the nail. The patient should be given a cutout shoe and instructed to replace the gauze daily and perform warm soaks several times daily until the inflammation has subsided. Activity should be modified to minimize pressure on the toe. The patient must also be educated on proper nail care, which includes trimming the nail with squared corners that extend distal to the hyponychium.\n\n\n\n\nIn the subsequent stage of ingrown toenail formation, in which the edematous and erythematous lateral nail fold extends well over the nail plate, abscess formation has likely occurred. Though it is less likely to be effective at this stage, nonsurgical management as described above may be achievable with vigilant care. All compression upon the toe should be removed, including socks or hosiery. Warm water soaks should be performed at least 4-5 times daily. Antibiotics are of unclear value but should be given in the setting of significant cellulitis or to patients who are diabetic or immunocompromised. Wound cultures may be obtained to direct antibiotic choice. Numerous alternative methods of conservative treatment have been described, including splints and commercially-available devices.\n [1, 3] Devices that have shown promise include shape memory alloys (SMAs), either of a Cu-Al-Mn base\n [4] or a Ni-Ti base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Laser Treatment of Scars and Stria Distensae": "\nOverview\n\n\nInjury to the skin initiates a cascade of events that is collectively known as wound healing. Wound healing attempts to restore the barrier function as well the tensile strength to the injured skin. When healing deviates from its orderly pattern, abnormal or hypertrophic scarring can result. Although pigment and vascular alterations are often transient in nature,\n [1] textural changes caused by collagen disruption can be permanent, particularly in the case of keloid scarring.\n [2] \nThe wound-healing process is divided into 3 sequential yet overlapping stages known as inflammation, granulation, and remodeling.\n [3] The initial stage is characterized by a response to cutaneous injury involving inflammatory cells.\n [4] Neutrophils are the first cells present in an injury, and they serve to debride bacteria and necrotic tissue as well as recruit other mediators.\n [4] Subsequently, macrophages arrive and elaborate a variety of cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby creating an environment that promotes granulation tissue formation.\n [3] \n\n\nDuring the proliferative phase, fibroblasts arrive, proliferate, and deposit collagen, which initially consists of type III and later, type I.\n [5] Simultaneously, angiogenic factors released into the wound environment stimulate the formation of new capillaries. Keratinocytes also migrate across the wound, leading to reepithelialization.\n [5] \nDuring remodeling, there is simultaneous collagen formation and degradation, while the presence of myofibroblasts contribute to increasing the tensile strength within the wound.\n [2] Granulation tissue deposition wanes as the cells responsible during this stage undergo apoptosis; failure for this to occur may result in a hypertrophic scar.\n [6] In the case of a hypertrophic scar, an overzealous healing response occurs, in which fibroblasts, small vessels, and collagen fibers are arranged in a nodular pattern.\n [2] Alternatively, collagen can be inadequately replaced and, as a result, can form a pitted appearance resembling the surface of a golf ball.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough scars rarely pose a significant health risk, patients with exaggerated scarring can present with physical and psychosocial distress.\n [6] The physician should aim to minimize scar formation or at least anticipate its severity, considering the patient’s history of hypertrophic/keloid scarring, as well as body site (as certain regions sustain greater tension, leading to an increased risk of scarring).\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this article is to review the strengths and limitations of current laser technology used to improve the appearance and symptomatology of hypertrophic scars, keloids, striae, atrophic scars, and acne scars.\n\nRelated Medscape articles include Keloid and Hypertrophic Scar and Scar Revision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Materials for Wound Closure": "\nWound Healing and Closure\n\n\nWounds can heal by secondary intention, or they can be primarily closed by a variety of methods. Although the skill and technique of the surgeon are important, so is the choice of wound closure materials. The purpose of these materials is to maintain wound closure until a wound is strong enough to withstand daily tensile forces and to enhance wound healing when the wound is most vulnerable.\nIn order to fully appreciate the essentials of a wound closure, it is first important to understand the process of wound healing. Healing occurs in 4 stages—hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.\n\n\nThe stage of hemostasis begins immediately after injury. While some authors consider this process part of the inflammatory stage, it should be recognized that in the process of hemostasis, the formation of fibrin and degranulation of platelets sets the stage for the subsequent stages. The inflammatory stage begins shortly after injury. In this stage, the immune system mobilizes to remove damaged tissue and bacteria from the wound. The proliferative stage is the tissue-formation stage in which reepithelialization, angiogenesis, and fibroblast proliferation and migration predominate. During the final stage, the extracellular matrix, which is composed of fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans, and type III collagen, is deposited and constantly remodeled with the final accumulation of mature type I collagen. This stage may occur for as long as 6-12 months after wounding.\nWound strength gradually increases throughout the healing process, reaching about 20% of the preinjury strength at 3 weeks. Postinjury skin strength ultimately only reaches 70-80% of that of normal skin. The components of the phases wound healing are depicted in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWound healing phases.

        "Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nAfter Cahan's first description of radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy in 1951,\n [1]  complete mediastinal lymph node dissection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remained a controversial procedure. The procedure was found to provide optimal staging for resectable NSCLC, but its therapeutic value continued to be debated. One study reported that only 57.3% of patients had any mediastinal nodes removed at the time of pulmonary resection.\n [2] \nAccurate pretreatment staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in lung cancer is essential to determining prognosis and treatment because patients with involved mediastinal lymph nodes may not benefit from upfront surgical resection. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) lack both sensitivity and specificity for accurate lymph node staging. Transbronchial and esophageal needle aspiration provide specificity, but technical constraints hamper sensitivity.\n\n\nSurgical mediastinoscopy is the pretherapeutic staging maneuver with the highest sensitivity and specificity, but it is dependent on the number of lymph nodes sampled and has technical limitations, especially for left-upper-lobe tumors. Additionally, the lymphatic system of the lungs has substantial anatomic variability, and skip metastasis can be found in 25% of cases.\n [3]  Thus, a significant number of patients who undergo surgical resection of their lung cancer may harbor positive mediastinal lymph nodes.\nA mediastinal lymphadenectomy may be performed to achieve complete staging (possibly to make postoperative treatment decisions), better locoregional control, and improved overall survival. Arguments against the procedure include increased operating time, possible increased morbidity, and lack of conclusive evidence to support an increased survival rate from the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0030 study suggested that complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy does not improve survival for early-stage NSCLC. However, in this trial, complete dissection was compared with rigorous systematic sampling. Thus, surgeons adhering to the highest standards of complete lung cancer staging should continue to perform thorough mediastinal lymph node sampling.\n\n\n\n\nThere is growing acceptance of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in the surgical treatment of early-stage lung cancer. The difficulty in performing a mediastinal lymphadenectomy thoracoscopically may affect the continued use of this procedure. The statement made by Robert Ginsberg in 1997 remains true today: “The addition of mediastinal lymph node dissection produces the best possible surgical and pathologic staging of lymph node disease but has yet to be proven more efficacious as a curative procedure.”\n [4] \n\nComplete mediastinal lymphadenectomy will continue to be performed in medical centers demanding the most comprehensive information. This is justified by previous data demonstrating that the dissection can be performed with minimal time and no increase in morbidity and mortality.\n\nFor centers pursuing minimally invasive techniques, VATS mediastinal lymph node staging and video-assisted mediastinal lymphadenectomy (VAMLA) are clinically feasible procedures with accurately staging and acceptable complication rate. Academic medical centers with the infrastructure and experience will provide the data needed validate the application of noninvasive techniques to optimally stage and ultimately treat patients with NSCLC.\n\nTranscervical extended mediastinal lymphadenectomy (TEMLA) is another approach that has been the subject of increasing interest.\n [5, 6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Modified Radical Mastectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA modified radical mastectomy is a procedure in which the entire breast is removed, including the skin, areola, nipple, and most axillary lymph nodes, but the pectoralis major muscle is spared. Historically, a modified radical mastectomy was the primary method of treatment for breast cancer.\n [1, 2] As the treatment of breast cancer evolved, breast conservation has become more widely used.\n [3, 4] However, mastectomy still remains a viable option for women with breast cancer.\n [5, 6] \n\n\nIndications\nIt currently remains the patient’s choice to undergo breast conservation or mastectomy with or without reconstruction. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 10801 trial found no significant difference in the 20-year overall survival rate between women who underwent breast-conserving surgery and radiation and those who were treated with modified radical mastectomy, for stage 1 or 2 breast cancer. Overall survival at 20 years was 44% in the breast-conserving surgery group and 39% in the modified radical mastectomy group. Time to distant metastasis also did not differ significantly between the two groups, although the study did find that the 10-year locoregional recurrence of cancer was higher in the breast-conserving group than in the mastectomy patients (20% vs 12%, respectively).\n [7] \n\n\n\n\nThere are a few contraindications to breast conservation for which a mastectomy is recommended. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines,\n [8] indications for mastectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior radiation therapy to the breast or chest wall\n\n\n\n\nRadiation therapy contraindicated by pregnancy (except patients in the third trimester who can receive radiation postpartum)\n\n\n\n\nInflammatory breast cancer\n\n\n\n\nDiffuse suspicious or malignant-appearing microcalcifications\n\n\n\n\nWidespread disease that is multicentric, located in more than one quadrant, and cannot be removed through a single incision with negative margins\n\n\n\n\nA positive pathologic margin after repeat re-excision and suboptimal cosmetic outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative indications for mastectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nActive connective tissue disease involving skin (eg, scleroderma, lupus)\n\n\n\n\nTumors greater that 5 cm in diameter\n\n\n\n\nFocally positive margin\n\n\n\nA consensus statement from an international expert panel specified that following maximal disease response to chemotherapy (in HER-2–normal patients) or chemotherapy and dual (pertuzumab and trastuzumab) anti–HER-2 treatment (in HER-2–positive patients), inflammatory breast cancer should be treated with modified radical mastectomy, including skin, breast, and axillary-node resection.\n [9]  A study by Partain et al indicated that modified radical mastectomy and partial/complete chemotherapeutic response by distant disease are independent factors for improved overall survival in de novo stage IV inflammatory breast cancer, with the hazard ratio for the mastectomy procedure being 0.52.\n [10] \n\nA study by Chen et al indicated that in a subset of patients with de novo stage IV inflammatory breast cancer, those who undergo modified radical mastectomy have a greater disease-specific survival (DSS) rate than do patients who do not undergo surgery. Patients in the report were aged 18 years or older with cT4d/pT4d pathology, histology type 8530 and 8533, and distant disease. The modified radical mastectomy (MRM) group included patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy and those whose mastectomy surgery included the removal of at least 10 lymph nodes. The 5-year DSS rates for MRM and nonsurgery patients were 31.4% and 17.7%, respectively, while survival times were 38 months and 27 months, respectively. The investigators noted that the percentages of patients who had only one metastatic site, who underwent chemotherapy, and who were treated with radiation therapy were greater in the MRM group.\n [11] \n\nPatients who are younger than 35 years of age or premenopausal with known BRCA1/2 mutations have an increased risk of local recurrence. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy may be considered for risk reduction.\n\nContraindications\nThere are very few contraindications to a modified radical mastectomy. For patients who present with metastatic disease, the primary mode of treatment remains systemic therapy. Mastectomy is currently not the standard of care for patients with metastatic disease. Additional contraindications involve patients who are unable to receive general anesthesia.\n [12] \n\nTechnical Considerations\nBest Practices\n\nThere has been recent national debate over the indication for axillary lymph node dissection. Current indications for a level I or II axillary dissection in patient undergoing a mastectomy include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nPreoperative diagnosis of positive axillary lymph node metastasis on fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy\n\n\n\n\nPrior inadequate axillary lymph node dissection\n\n\n\n\nPositive intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy\n\n\n\n\nFailed mapping for a sentinel lymph node biopsy\n\n\n\n\nClinically suspicious nodes at the time of surgery\n\n\n\n\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy (outside clinical trials)\n\n\n\n\nAxillary local recurrence\n\n\n\nPatients should be evaluated for an axillary lymph node dissection on a case-by-case basis. Axillary dissection may not benefit patients with favorable tumor characteristics, elderly patients, patients with multiple comorbidities, or patients for whom a full axillary dissection will not influence the recommendation regarding systemic treatment.\n\nProcedure Planning\n\nPatients who undergo a mastectomy have the option for immediate or delayed reconstruction using autologous tissue or implants. Prior to the mastectomy, patients should be referred to a plastic surgeon. The decision for immediate or delayed reconstruction is made based on the need for postmastectomy radiation and surgeon preference.\n [13] \n\nComplication Prevention\n\nComplications associated with a modified radical mastectomy include issues associated with wound healing, such as hematoma, infection, dehiscence, chronic seroma, and skin necrosis. The risk of skin necrosis often involves the superior flap and the wound edges. It is often treated with only local debridement and wound care.\n\nA randomized, controlled trial by Archana et al indicated that compared with electrocautery, the use of the harmonic scalpel in modified radical mastectomy significantly reduces the incidence of seromas found on initial postoperative follow-up (34.3% vs 21.7%, respectively), as well as the mean total seroma drainage volume (937.5 mL vs 470 mL, respectively).\n [14]  A retrospective study by van Bastelaar et al indicated that following either a mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy or a modified radical mastectomy, flap fixation using sutures or ARTISS fibrin sealant lessened the need for postoperative seroma aspiration compared with a drain-only approach.\n [15] \n\nSimilarly, in a study of patients who underwent mastectomy, including modified radical mastectomy, de Rooij et al found that flap fixation using sutures significantly reduced postoperative seroma aspiration compared with conventional wound closure. The investigators reported that 7.3% of suture fixation patients underwent aspiration, compared with 17.5% of those treated with conventional closure.\n [16] \n\nPatients at a higher risk for postoperative complications are those with diabetes, smokers, patients with a history of prior chest wall radiation, and patients with diffuse small vessel disease. After an axillary dissection, along with the normal local healing issues, the alteration of the regional lymphatic system puts patients at an increased risk of complications.\n\nFor patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy prior to axillary dissection, there is a risk of anaphylaxis related to the isosulfan blue contrast agent. The anesthesiologist and patient should be aware of this rare complication, which often resolves intraoperatively.\n [17] \n\nPatients who have undergone a completion axillary dissection have an increased risk of developing lymphedema.\n [18] They also are at increased risk of numbness under the axilla or even hypersensitization and chronic pain in that area. Patients are encouraged to ambulate the arm early with stretching exercises to prevent decreased shoulder function and scarring of the muscle, which can lead to cording and chronic pain syndromes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

A sharp object often goes through the nail and amputates the tip rather than stopping; this causes a clean laceration of nail bed. The middle and distal thirds of the nail bed are the most frequent sites of injury, and 50% of injuries involve fracture of the distal phalanx, tuft, or both.\n\n\n\n\nPrimary assessment includes obtaining a good patient history, including the timing and mechanism of the injury. The physical examination should looks for signs of contamination, exposure of bone, viability of surrounding skin, and evidence of fingertip contusion.

        "Nasal Polypectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nNasal polyps may present in patients who report perennial nasal congestion, obstruction, and anosmia or hyposmia. In contrast to many individuals who have chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps who present with headache and facial pressure and pain, patients with nasal polyposis generally do not report those symptoms unless they have a concurrent infection. Nasal polyps typically are semitranslucent, pale, gray masses in the nasal cavity.\n\n\nNasal polypectomy is a surgical procedure to remove polyps located in the nasal passages. Nasal polyps affect 2-5% of the population\n [1] and may occur in association with chronic rhinosinusitis, cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, Samter triad (asthma, nasal polyposis, and aspirin sensitivity), or as an isolated phenomenon. Children with nasal polyps should be evaluated for cystic fibrosis. Studies suggest both allergies and a family history of nasal polyps are predisposing factors in the growth of nasal polyps.\n [2, 3] The role of environmental exposure to smoking, pollution, and other chemicals remains controversial.\n [4, 5] \nCurrent research in nasal polyposis suggests multiple factors, including thymic stromal lymphopoietin/OX40 ligand axis up-regulation affecting eosinophilic inflammation,\n [6] interleukin (IL)–31 up-regulation of Th2 cytokines expressed by polyp cells promoting growth,\n [7] activity of forms of STAT3 affecting the development of nasal polyps,\n [8] and a multitude of other factors undergoing additional research endeavors.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Staphylococcus aureus exotoxins acting as superantigens may be a risk factor for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and the presence of this superantigen is related to the severity of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis.\n [9] \n\n\n\n\nNasal polyps are correlated with appreciable morbidity, economic costs, and impairment in quality of life.\n [2, 10, 11] Although medical management is possible, often nasal polypectomy is required for patients in whom conservative therapies fail.\n [12, 13] \n\nSee the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRigid endoscopic view of the left nasal cavity, showing the septum on the left.

        "Percutaneous Abscess Drainage": "\nBackground\n\n\nOne definition of an abscess is an infected fluid collection that is drainable. A common dictum is as follows: \"If it will not go through a catheter, it cannot be drained; if it is not infected, it is not an abscess.\"\nDifferentiating a phlegmon from an abscess can be difficult. A phlegmon may be defined as a vascularized infection that still has perfusion. Some nonsuppurative lymphadenitis may not demonstrate enhancement on imaging studies (eg, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or amplitude Doppler ultrasonography [US]), but other collections that do not show central enhancement suggest the presence of an abscess, hematoma, or necrosis.\n\n\nA phlegmon is an undrainable infection. A viscous abscess without significant debris may be difficult to aspirate through a needle but should be drainable through catheters of appropriate caliber. Irrigation with saline or fibrinolytic agents may be necessary for successful drainage of an abscess with significant debris, blood, or viscous elements.\n [1] \nPercutaneous abscess drainage (PAD),\n [2]  once revolutionary, has evolved into a routine procedure, replacing open surgical abscess drainage in all but the most difficult or inaccessible cases.\n [3, 4] It was originally believed that only patients with simple fluid collections were candidates for PAD; however, researchers subsequently demonstrated that both septated and viscous fluid collections could be successfully treated percutaneously, particularly with the adjunctive use of lytic agents. (As an example, the mucolytic agent acetylcysteine has been used for multiloculated liver abscesses.\n [5] ) In general, the simpler the abscess, the more likely it is that PAD will be rapidly successful.\n\n\n\n\nAn aggressive practical approach with relatively simple devices and techniques may yield a high success rate with few complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pilonidal Cystectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nPilonidal cystectomy is the surgical removal of a pilonidal cyst or tracts extending from a sinus. It may range from a simple procedure that involves excision of a small amount of tissue to a very complex procedure that may include allowing the wound to heal secondarily or rotating adjacent tissues into the defect after excision.\nRisk factors that have been attributed to developing a pilonidal cyst include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Increased friction or abrasion in the area\n         \n\n\n\n          Increased hair\n         \n\n\n\n          Deep natal cleft\n         \n\n\n\nA pilonidal cyst is believed to be an acquired condition caused by the presence of hair in involuted epithelial tissue in the natal cleft. Some clinicians have theorized that this condition is a congenital one, but it is more generally accepted that the presence of hair in the natal cleft causes a foreign body–like reaction that leads to inflammation and possibly infection.\n\n\n\n\nMedical management may reduce the severity of disease. Proper hygiene is paramount. Local hair control by laser epilation has been shown to be an effective therapy that decreases recurrence.\n [1, 2, 3]  Lifestyle changes to reduce repetitive trauma or friction to the area have also been encouraged. Rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in the pilonidal sinuses, which are similar to carcinomas arising in chronically inflamed areas.\n [4]  Thus, pilonidal cysts that are not amenable to medical management should lead to surgical referral for further evaluation.\n [5, 6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Scar Revision": "\nOverview\n\n\nAnnually, 200 million incisions are performed worldwide and approximately 170,000 scar revisions are performed in the United States.\n [1] The treatment of aesthetically unappealing scars can be challenging at times, although it is not without several options. The available options are vary widely, extending from invasive options such as scar excision to less invasive options such as topical silicone therapy. The varied choices for the patients should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis by a qualified plastic surgeon. \nPatients often present to a plastic surgeon after having exhausted other means of disguising their troublesome scars through the use of cosmetics, clothing, and hairstyle modifications. While various treatments exist, none is perfect, and the cornerstone of any scar revision is a thorough understanding of the patients' dissatisfaction, functional limitations as a result of such scar and their expectations following treatment. Patients must understand that the best result may require multiple treatments and that initially, little improvement may be noticeable relative to the preexisting deformity.\n\n\nOther considerations of paramount importance when considering scar revision include (1) anatomical location, (2) functional impairment from current scars such as in burn patients, and (3) the likelihood of functional impairment after scar revision (eg, increased tension and decreased range of motion). Prior to any intervention, the quality and skin type, as well as availability of surrounding tissue, must be assessed.\n [2, 3] Oftentimes, no treatment may be the best management if expectations cannot be met or if the resultant scar may not be reasonably improved.\nAn overview of scar revision and management is presented in this article. Operative and nonoperative alternatives are reviewed. This overview addresses the complex preoperative considerations, basic plastic surgical techniques, wound healing biochemistry and biomechanics, preferred revision techniques based on anatomic site, and technical considerations in revisional wound closure. Topical choices, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and steroid therapy for scar treatment are examined.\n\n\n\n\nMore aesthetically pleasing scars match the surrounding skin in color, texture, distensibility, elevation and are therefore less noticeable and desirable. For example, scars often have fewer dermal appendages or lack them altogether. In areas of hair-bearing skin, a scar's lack of hair follicles is particularly noticeable. In other areas with sparse hair follicles, this is a desirable attribute of scars.\n\n\n\n\nPatient characteristics also play a large factor in scarring, as do the quality of closure and cleanliness of the wound. Although many authors claim that patients at the extremes of age often scar to a greater degree, no indisputable evidence in the literature supports this claim.\n [4] Individuals with connective-tissue disease, on long-term steroid therapy, with diabetes mellitus, or with vitamin deficiencies or those who prematurely return to activity, smoke, have a predisposition to keloid formation, or subject themselves to harmful UV light exposure may experience healing complications that result in greater final scarring.\n\nTechnical details of the wound and approximation play an important role in eventual scar formation. Wounds that are excessively traumatized during closure may develop wound dehiscence or undergo skin-edge necrosis, thus leaving unsightly scars. Likewise, wounds that are unevenly or improperly repaired, become infected, or undergo foreign body reactions to sutures more frequently yield poor cosmetic results. Traumatic wounds traditionally yield poorer eventual scars. Common etiologies of widened or dehisced scars include wounds closed under tension, repairs not formed parallel to relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs), or wounds located on the trunk or extremities Proper screening of patients prior to surgery, proper nutrition, good technique, and appropriate wound care favor faster wound healing and more aesthetic results.\n\nRevision of unsightly scars is a frequent concern to surgical patients. Although residual scars can be aesthetically displeasing, form and function should be taken into consideration and should not be compromised at the cost of cosmesis. As with other cosmetic procedures, the main goal is to make the patient more comfortable with his or her appearance, even though the deformity may not be completely alleviated. A thorough understanding of the patient's expectations is warranted prior to modification. Teamwork between the physician and patient helps ensure the optimal result in scar revision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Squamous Cell Carcinoma": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn the head and neck, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) encompasses 2 distinct clinical entities: aerodigestive tract SCC (commonly referred to as head and neck SCC; HNSCC) and cutaneous SCC (cSCC). It is a malignant tumor of keratinizing epidermal cells. For both HNSCC and cSCC, the most common route of metastasis is lymphatic. However, both the investigation and the treatment of a patient with a clinically N0 nodal basin remain controversial. Particularly in oral cavity SCC, up to 30% of patients have subclinical (not found on examination or imaging) metastases in the neck, and knowledge of lymph node disease alters surgical and postoperative management.\n [1, 2, 3] \nThe sentinel lymph node\nThe sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node to drain a metastatic tumor cell that drains via the lymphatic route. The concept of the SLN is based on the orderly progression of tumor cells within the lymphatic system. Mapping of the lymph flow from the tumor site to the regional lymphatic drainage area can be used to identify the primary draining lymph node (ie, SLN). If the SLN can be identified and examined for the presence of tumor metastases, an elective lymph node dissection for staging may not need to be performed.\n\n\nThe concept of the SLN originated in 1977 when Cabanas described mapping of the first lymph node–draining penile carcinoma. In 1977, Robinson et al described the use of cutaneous lymphoscintigraphy in the nodal basin for truncal melanomas using colloidal gold scanning. The development of lymphatic mapping at the end of the 1980s was a breakthrough in making the sentinel node concept applicable to various types of malignancies, particularly breast cancer and melanoma. In 1993, Alex et al introduced the use of technetium-99m sulfur colloid, a radioactive tracer, which is injected intradermally around a primary melanoma site, followed by an imaging study and subsequent intraoperative use of a gamma probe to localize the sentinel node.\n [4] This technique is now commonly practiced for early-stage melanoma without clinically evident nodal metastasis. Alex and Krag performed the first successful SLN biopsy (SNLB) of the head and neck on a patient with a supraglottic carcinoma.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nRelevance of SLNB in SCC\nApproximately 3.3 million patients are diagnosed with 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte skin cancer (cSCC or basal cell carcinoma) in the United States each year. Approximately 80% of ultraviolet light–induced SCCs develop on the arms, head, or neck. The frequency of cSCC, as with all nonmelanoma skin cancers, is increasing. Recent projections suggest 300,000-400,000 new cases of cSCC per year.\n\n\n\n\ncSCC is the second leading cause of skin cancer death after melanoma, and it is the second most common type of nonmelanoma skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma. Most cSCCs occur on the sun-exposed areas of the head and the neck. Nodal metastasis is relatively uncommon, only occurring approximately 3% of the time, and it is even less likely in early-stage disease (T1-T2).\n [6] While it is uncommon, patients with aggressive disease have a high risk of development of nodal metastasis that may be subclinical at initial presentation.\n [7] \n\nBy 2017 estimates (American Cancer Society Facts and Figures),\n [8] approximately 70,000 cases of HNSCC are diagnosed in the United States each year. SCC can occur in any mucosal area of the head and neck, including the nasal cavity and sinuses, nasopharynx, oral cavity (including lower lip), oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx. Smoking and alcohol use are historically the primary risk factors for HNSCC, but the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)–related cancers of the oropharynx is rising rapidly. The latter rarely present without nodal disease, so SLNB is unlikely to have a role in the management of HPV-related tumors of the oropharynx. SLNB has primarily been investigated in lesions of the oral cavity, given the historically high rates of nodal metastasis noted above and the accessibility of these tumors for radiotracer injection. It can have a significant impact on the need for lymph node dissection.\n\nPositron-emission tomography (PET-CT), contrasted CT, and MRI are commonly used to classify tumors and nodal or distant metastases of SCC. Definitive staging of lymph node disease can only be achieved by performing a staging lymph node dissection. For mucosal disease in its early stages (T1-T3, N0), clinicians have to balance the benefit of performing an elective (prophylactic) lymph node dissection against the associated morbidity. For cSCC, elective neck dissection is uncommon.\n\nFor more information, see Head and Neck Cancer and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.\n\nEtiology\nAny of the following may cause SCC:\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure to sunlight\n\n\n\n\nChemical carcinogens, such as arsenic and hydrocarbons\n\n\n\n\nHPV\n\n\n\n\nIonizing radiation\n\n\n\n\nCigarette smoke\n\n\n\n\nChronic irritation or ulceration\n\n\n\n\nAlcohol\n\n\n\nIn addition, immunocompromised patients have a much higher risk of developing SCC. Two genes, PATCHED and TP53, have been identified that usually prevent cancers but are inactivated in patients with SCC; TP53 is mutated in more than 90% of patients with SCC.\n\nClinical manifestations\ncSCCs typically manifest on the head, neck, or arms. They usually have elevated and rolled edges with central ulceration. Well-differentiated SCCs are likely to manifest as firm erythematous nodules of varying sizes, sometimes with an area of central hyperkeratosis. The tumor is usually firm, although tumors in more advanced cases can be soft and friable. Erosion and ulceration are more common with SCCs. Poorly differentiated SCCs are more apt to manifest as faintly erythematous nodules or plaques that are not well defined; ulceration is also common.\n\nSee the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge, sun-induced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the forehead/temple. Image courtesy of Glenn Goldman, MD. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nHNSCC typically manifests as an irregular, at times ulcerated, friable mass of the oral, oropharyngeal, laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or sinonasal mucosa. Lesions appearing in the oral cavity are subclassified according to anatomic location; the lower lip can exhibit HNSCC on the mucosal surface or cSCC on the skin surface. Oral cavity HNSCC is most amenable to SLNB because of the generally easy accessibility of the primary lesions.\n\nSuccessful SLNB\nDefining a successful SLNB accurately is critical. Although some studies have examined the impact of an individual surgeon's experience on the SLN identification rate, SLN identification is clearly not an appropriate endpoint; many studies have documented excellent SLN identification rates with unacceptably high false-negative rates, typically defined as a negative SLNB when there is either a metastatic lymph node at the time of surgery or recurrence in the nodal basin where the SLN was identified.\n [9] The more important issue is the experience required to achieve an acceptably low false-negative rate. Such rates are typically identified through prospective studies in which the neck is dissected after an SLNB to provide a point of comparison. In cases in which the pathology results from the scintigram are unclear or are negative, a formal elective neck dissection should be considered for staging purposes.\n\nThis procedure is multidisciplinary. As such, surgeons must ensure that experienced nuclear medicine specialists, radiologists, and pathologists are involved. The learning curve for individual surgeons is undoubtedly associated with the experience levels of specialists within the multidisciplinary team. The implications of the SLN procedure must be effectively communicated to radiation oncologists and medical oncologists. The coordination of effort among the various specialists in each discipline is an essential component of the learning process.\n\nThe role of the SLNB in the management of SCC of the head and the neck will evolve as more centers actively perform the technique.\n [10, 11, 12] \n\nPatient education\nFor patient education information, see the Cancer and Tumors Center, as well as Skin Cancer, Skin Biopsy, and Cancer of the Mouth and Throat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Melanoma": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe incidence of melanoma has risen in the last three decades, with an estimated 106,110 new diagnoses and 7,180 deaths in 2021.\n [1] Survival rates are profoundly affected by the stage at time of diagnosis, which is determined by nodal involvement. Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs)—the first lymph nodes involved in lymphatic spread—can predict the potential for cancer in the local nodal basin or beyond. The histology of the sentinel node reflects the histology of the remaining lymphatic basin. Lymphatic mapping with SLN biopsy (SLNB) (see the image below) is associated with significantly fewer complications than regional lymphadenectomy and is recommended for patients at risk for metastasis. SLNB provides important information for both prognostic and treatment purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntraoperative left axillary sentinel lymph node seen after uptake with blue dye. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nTechnical expertise is necessary for adequate identification of the sentinel node. Indications (see below) for SNLB should be evaluated individually, and a thorough discussion regarding the risks and benefits of performing SLNB should be undertaken with the patient.\nIndications for SLNB\nSLNB is designated for patients with significant risk of metastasis. Risk of metastasis is directly related to tumor thickness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLNB should not be offered for melanoma in situ, where cancer cells are confined to the epidermis.\n\nSLNB should not be recommended routinely for thin melanomas that are T1a (nonulcerated lesions < 0.8 mm Breslow thickness), as the probability of positivity is less than 5%. However, if adverse features such as mitotic index greater than 2 mm2 (especially in younger patients) or lymphovascular invasion are present, the probability is increased to 5-10%, and SLNB may be considered.\n\nSLNB should be considered for thin melanomas that are T1b (0.8 to 1 mm thickness or < 0.8 mm with ulceration).\n\nSLNB should be recommended to patients with a clinically negative nodal basin and intermediate thickness primary melanomas (T2 or T3; >1 mm to 4 mm).\n\nSLNB should be considered for thick melanomas (T4; >4 mm) and clinically negative nodes.\n\nSLNB may be considered for melanoma that exhibits regression (controversial).\n\nPotential contraindications for SLNB\nSLNB is unnecessary if systemic disease is present.\n\nSLNB may not be reliable if there has been previous extensive surgery in the targeted lymph node basin.\n\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy of the node is preferable to SLNB as a first step when a clinically evident node is present.\n\nThere is debate about SLNB following a wide local excision; however, it may be acceptable if extensive reconstruction has not been performed.\n\nSome suggest that repeat SLNB following a prior SLNB is inadvisable; however, no definitive recommendations exist in the melanoma literature. The authors do not consider prior SLNB a contraindication for repeat biopsy.\n\nFor patients who are deemed nonsurgical candidates owing to health conditions, or for patients who will not follow postbiopsy recommendations, an SNLB may be avoided.\n\nCurrently available genetic expression profiling testing should not be used to determine SLNB candidacy.\n\nStaging\nClinical staging is based on physical examination and lesion biopsy. Clinical staging commonly involves the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system as developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) in collaboration with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). This system incorporates the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). Tumor thickness (T) is recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm.

        "Simple Mastectomy": "\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\nA simple mastectomy involves removing the breast along with an ellipse of skin that encompasses the nipple-areola complex. Unlike a radical mastectomy, it does not involve removal of the underlying muscles and uninvolved lymph nodes (see the images below).\n\n\nThe surgical principles underlying simple mastectomy have a long history. First defined in ancient Egyptian literature, mastectomy was systematically detailed in 1882 by Halsted, who advocated a radical extensive procedure that involved excision not only of the breast but also of the underlying pectoral muscles and axillary lymph nodes.\n [1] This operation was associated with poor cosmesis and significant impairment of shoulder movements.\nFor decades, this operation was the only treatment of breast cancer. Gradually, it became clear that an extensive local procedure did not necessarily translate into a marked improvement in patient survival. Accordingly, surgeons began experimenting with less radical procedures, and various modifications of the radical mastectomy were developed. A National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project study from 1977 showed that the cure rate for the Halsted operation was no higher than that for a simple mastectomy.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostmastectomy scar. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMastectomy scar 10 days after operation. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nAs medical knowledge of tumor biology has grown, surgeons have come to realize that combining surgical treatment with adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy allows better control of the cancer and results in higher disease-free survival and local recurrence rates. Breast-conserving surgery, the safety of which has been proven in randomized controlled trials, is another surgical option for selected patients.\n\nA study by Al-Himdani et al comparing patient characteristics and outcomes between individuals who underwent skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) and those treated with simple mastectomy found that the 8-year local breast cancer recurrence rates for SSM versus simple mastectomy were 7.9% and 5%, respectively. With regard to SSM, the investigators also found that patients were younger on average and that lymph nodes were less often involved (22% vs 44%), while the frequency of ductal carcinoma in situ was greater (79% vs 53%). SSM patients also more often had involved margins (29% vs 15%). The study included 577 patients, 80% of whom underwent simple mastectomy and 20% of whom were treated with SSM.\n [3] \n\nIn another study comparing different types of mastectomy, Son et al found that among 300 patients who underwent SSM (17.3%), total SSM (39.7%), or simple mastectomy (43%), for invasive lobular carcinoma, time to local recurrence and positive margin rates did not differ by surgical method.\n [4] \n\nA retrospective study by Hotton et al of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ who were treated with simple mastectomy found a low rate of positive sentinel lymph node biopsies in persons without microinvasion. According to the investigators, this suggested that such biopsy is less appropriate in patients with pure ductal carcinoma in situ than it is in those with microinvasion.\n [5] \n\nIndications\nIndications for a simple mastectomy without an axillary procedure are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk-reducing mastectomy\n [6, 7] \n\n\n\n\nLocal recurrence in a previously treated breast cancer\n\n\n\n\nMalignant phyllodes tumor\n [8] \n\n\n\nIndications for a simple mastectomy with a concomitant axillary procedure, which may be either a sentinel node biopsy or an axillary clearance, are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nLocally advanced breast cancer\n\n\n\n\nMultifocal breast cancer\n\n\n\n\nLarge tumor relative to the size of the breast, excision of which may compromise final cosmesis\n\n\n\n\nExtensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\n\n\n\n\nPatient unsuitability for breast-conserving approaches as a result of contraindications for radiation therapy - Such contraindications include a previous history of chest wall irradiation, either after previous breast-conserving therapy or in mantle field radiation therapy for lymphoma; severe skin disorders, such as scleroderma and psoriasis; and severe pulmonary dysfunction\n\n\n\n\nPatient preference for mastectomy - A patient who is a suitable candidate for breast conservation may opt for a mastectomy instead\n\n\n\nContraindications\nA mastectomy is contraindicated in patients who have locally advanced breast cancer that is inoperable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Skin Adnexectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nRemoving the skin adnexa, or adnexectomy, is a procedure that attempts to remove the skin appendages, such as sweat glands, for conditions such as excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), malodor (bromhidrosis or osmidrosis), or hidradenitis suppurativa. The goal of the surgery is to reduce these problems long term while minimizing unwanted side effects and complications.

Thus, hyperhidrosis can be a debilitating diagnosis that can impair social and occupational activities.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\nNo ethnic predilection for hyperhidrosis has been reported; however, multiple studies have described axillary osmidrosis as a significant issue in Far Eastern populations.\n [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Axillary osmidrosis or bromhidrosis is unpleasant odor arising from the axilla, which can cause significant personal discomfort and social impairment, especially in Asian societies. In Western countries, people tend to be primarily concerned with axillary hyperhidrosis, whereas in Asian countries, people seek out treatment for osmidrosis.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nIndividuals with hyperhidrosis may frequently have a family history positive for the diagnosis.\n\nEtiology\nExcessive axillary sweating, termed hyperhidrosis, is defined by excessive perspiration greater than the normal physiologic response for the body for thermoregulation.\n [10] Under normal physiologic conditions, sweat glands are stimulated when body temperature elevates, which then produce moisture at the skin surface that may cool the body through the process of evaporation. Sweating may occur episodically, continuously, or seasonally and may be exacerbated by emotions, such as anxiety or nervousness.\n [10] Hyperhidrosis can be divided into primary or secondary. Primary hyperhidrosis has recognizable cause, but many causes of secondary hyperhidrosis have been described, including fevers, metabolic or endocrine disorders, medications, or various physiologic states (eg, menopause, exercise).\n [11] \n\nPathophysiology\nTwo main types of sweat glands are recognized: eccrine sweat glands and apocrine sweat glands (see image below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth apocrine and eccrine sweat glands are present in the skin of the axilla. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nEccrine sweat glands are the primary producers of sweat and are located diffusely throughout the skin of the body, with the highest concentrations of glands found in the axilla, palms, and soles of the feet. Eccrine sweat glands secrete sweat through pores located on epidermal ridges and empty directly to the skin surface. Apocrine sweat glands are a subset of glands located in the axilla and genital regions that become active during puberty, under the influence of androgen hormones.\n [4] Apocrine glands secrete sweat into the follicular canal of their associated hair follicles. These glands secrete fluid that is thought to cause offensive odor, which is termed osmidrosis or bromhidrosis when excessive.\n\nIn white patients, either all or nearly all eccrine and apocrine sweat glands are not found in the dermis layer in the skin itself but rather within the subcutaneous tissue itself or at the interface of the subcutaneous tissue and the dermis.\n [12] The anatomic location of the sweat glands themselves provides the basis for the various surgical procedures available for the treatment of hyperhidrosis and osmidrosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Skin and Soft Tissue Infections - Incision, Drainage, and Debridement": "\nBackground\n\n\nSkin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), which include infections of skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle, encompass a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from simple cellulitis to rapidly progressive necrotizing fasciitis. Diagnosing the exact extent of the disease is critical for successful management of a patient of soft-tissue infection.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \nThe various types of SSTIs, listed according to clinical presentation and anatomic location, include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nImpetigo\n\n\n\n\nFolliculitis\n\n\n\n\nFuruncles\n\n\n\n\nCarbuncles\n\n\n\n\nErysipelas\n\n\n\n\nCellulitis\n\n\n\n\nNecrotizing fasciitis, also known as hemolytic streptococcal gangrene, Meleney ulcer, synergistic gangrene, and Fournier gangrene (when localized to the scrotum and perineal area)\n\n\n\n\nPyomyositis\n\n\n\n\nSSTIs may be caused by any of a formidable number of pathogenic microorganisms, and they may be either monomicrobial or polymicrobial. The following are the most important pathogens:\n\n\n\n\n\nStaphylococcus aureus (the most common pathogen)\n\n\n\n\nStreptococcus pyogenes\n\n\n\n\nSite-specific infections - Indigenous organisms (eg, gram-negative bacilli in perianal abscesses)\n\n\n\n\nImmunocompromised hosts and complicated SSTIs - Multiple organisms or uncommon organisms (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Enterococcus)\n\n\n\n\nPolymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis - Mixed infection with both aerobes (eg, streptococci, staphylococci, or aerobic gram-negative bacilli) and anaerobes (eg, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, or Clostridium)\n\n\n\n\nMonomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis: S pyogenes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification of SSTIs\nFor the purposes of this article, SSTI may be divided into the following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomplicated SSTI\n\n\n\n\nNonnecrotizing complicated SSTI\n\n\n\n\nNecrotizing fasciitis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomplicated SSTIs include superficial cellulitis, folliculitis, furunculosis, simple abscesses, and minor wound infections. These infections respond well to either source control management (ie, drainage or debridement) or a simple course of antibiotics. These infections pose little risk to life and limb.\n\nComplicated SSTIs involve the invasion of deeper tissues and typically require significant surgical intervention. The response to therapy is often complicated by underlying disease states. Complicated SSTIs include complicated abscesses, infected burn wounds, infected ulcers, infections in diabetics, and deep-space wound infections. They are often limb- or life-threatening.\n\nNecrotizing fasciitis is a progressive, rapidly spreading, inflammatory infection that is located in the deep fascia and is associated with secondary necrosis of the subcutaneous tissues. The inflammation of the deep fascia causes thrombosis of the dermal vessels, and it is this thrombosis that is responsible for the secondary necrosis of the overlying subcutaneous tissue and skin.\n\nIt is imperative to distinguish necrotizing infections from nonnecrotizing infections. Early diagnosis and intervention may save a life; delayed diagnosis and treatment may lead to loss of a limb or a life.\n\nPredisposing factors\nFactors predisposing to the development of SSTIs include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nBreach in the epidermis\n\n\n\n\nDry and irritated skin\n\n\n\n\nImmunocompromised status - Malnutrition, hypoproteinemia, burns, diabetes mellitus, AIDS\n\n\n\n\nChronic venous insufficiency\n\n\n\n\nChronic lymphatic insufficiency\n\n\n\n\nChronic neuropathy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Skin Biopsy": "\nBackground\n\n\nSkin biopsy is performed in order to obtain tissue for further examination in the laboratory, typically through microscopy or tissue culture. Because of the relatively low risk of skin biopsy as compared with biopsy of other organs, and the ability to obtain a sample under simple local anesthesia, a skin biopsy can be safely and routinely performed in an outpatient or ambulatory setting, as well as an inpatient setting. The usual intent of skin biopsy is to further characterize the nature of a skin growth or eruption and assist in diagnosis by allowing histopathologic evaluation of a tissue sample.\nAfter local anesthetic is administered, the tissue is removed and placed in a specimen container with an appropriate fixative, usually 10% formalin for permanent section diagnosis or Michel’s solution for immunofluorescence. The specimen is then sent to a pathology laboratory, where, after tissue fixation, slide preparation, and staining, a pathologist, dermatologist, or dermatopathologist can examine the specimen under a microscope. Alternatively, the tissue is placed in normal saline rather than a fixative for viral or bacterial laboratory cultures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Subungual Hematoma Drainage": "\nOverview\n\n\nSubungual hematomas are common nail bed injuries caused by blunt or sharp trauma to the fingers or toes.\n [1, 2] Bleeding from the rich vascular nail bed results in increased pressure under the nail and can cause significant discomfort.\n [3] Subungual hematoma drainage, also known as nail bed trephination, can be performed to relieve this discomfort.\n [4] \nFor information on various nail pathologies, see Medscape article Nail Pathology.\n\n\nAnatomy\nThe perionychium is the tissue on each side of the nail, and the eponychium is the skin immediately proximal to the nail. Beneath the eponychium lies the germinal matrix; its distal portion, or lunula, is visible under the proximal nail. The germinal matrix generates most of the nail, while the more distal sterile matrix adheres the nail to the nail bed and assists with nail migration. Injury to the germinal matrix may lead to permanent nail loss.\n [5, 6] Nail bed anatomy is depicted in the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNail bed anatomy figure 1. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNail bed anatomy figure 2. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nFor more information about the relevant anatomy, see Nail Anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Suturing Techniques": "\nBackground\n\n\nAs a method for closing cutaneous wounds, the technique of suturing is thousands of years old. Although suture materials and aspects of the technique have changed, the primary goals remain the same, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing dead space\n\n\n\n\nSupporting and strengthening wounds until healing increases their tensile strength\n\n\n\n\nApproximating skin edges for an aesthetically pleasing and functional result\n\n\n\n\nMinimizing the risks of bleeding and infection\n\n\n\n\nThe postoperative appearance of a beautifully designed closure or flap can be compromised if an incorrect suture technique is chosen or if the execution is poor. Conversely, meticulous suturing technique cannot fully compensate for improper surgical technique. Poor incision placement with respect to relaxed skin tension lines, excessive removal of tissue, or inadequate undermining may limit the surgeon’s options in wound closure and suture placement. Gentle handling of the tissue is also important to optimize wound healing.\nThe choice of suture technique depends on the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nType and anatomic location of the wound\n\n\n\n\nThickness of the skin\n\n\n\n\nDegree of tension\n\n\n\n\nDesired cosmetic result\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProper placement of sutures enhances the precise approximation of the wound edges, which helps minimize and redistribute skin tension. Wound eversion is essential to maximize the likelihood of good epidermal approximation. Eversion is desirable to minimize the risk of scar depression secondary to tissue contraction during healing. Usually, inversion is not desirable, and it probably does not decrease the risk of hypertrophic scarring in an individual with a propensity for hypertrophic scars.\n\nThe elimination of dead space, the restoration of natural anatomic contours, and the minimization of suture marks are also important to optimize the cosmetic and functional results.\n\nIn this article, the techniques of suture placement for various types of stitch are described, the rationale for choosing one suture technique over another is reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each suture technique are discussed. Frequently, more than one suture technique is needed for optimal closure of a wound. After reading this article, the reader should have an understanding of how and why particular sutures are chosen and an appreciation of the basic methods of placing each type of suture.\n [1, 2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Tendon Transfer Principles and Mechanics": "\nGeneral Principles of Tendon Transfer\n\n\nCertain key elements play crucial roles in tendon transfer operations.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] The following three important principles should be emphasized\n [7] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          The transfer should not significantly decrease the remaining function of the hand\n         \n\n\n\n          The transfer should not create a deformity if significant return of function occurs following a nerve repair\n         \n\n\n\n          The transfer should be phasic or capable of phase conservation\n         \n\n\n\nFor more information on tendon transfer in the hand, see Hand Tendon Transfers.\nFundamental principles of muscle-tendon units include the following.\n\n\n\n\nCorrection of contracture\nIn any patient with peripheral nerve palsy, all joints must be kept supple because soft-tissue contracture is far easier to prevent than it is to correct. Maximum passive motion of all joints must be present before a tendon transfer because no tendon transfer can move a stiff joint.\n\n\n\n\nAdequate strength\nThe tendon chosen as a donor for transfer must be strong enough to perform its new function in its altered position. Selecting an appropriate motor is important because a muscle will lose one grade of strength following transfer. It is vital not to transfer muscle that has been reinnervated or muscle that was paralyzed and has returned to function.\n\nAmplitude of motion\nThe amplitude of tendon excursion must be considered for each muscle. A wrist flexor with an excursion of 33 mm cannot substitute fully for a finger extensor with an amplitude of 50 mm. Although the true amplitude of a tendon cannot be increased, its effective amplitude can be augmented in either of the following two ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n          The natural tenodesis effect can be used by converting a muscle from monoarticular to biarticular or multiarticular\n         \n\n\n\n          Extensively dissecting a muscle from its surrounding fascial attachments can increase amplitude\n         \n\n\nStraight line of pull\nIn the most effective transfer, the muscle passes in a direct line from its origin to the insertion of the tendon being substituted. Although not always possible, this configuration is desirable.\n\nOne tendon, one function\nA single tendon cannot be expected to simultaneously perform diametrically opposing actions (eg, flexing and extending the same joint). If a muscle is inserted into two tendons with separate functions, the force of amplitude of the donor tendon is dissipated and less effective than that of a muscle motored by a single tendon.\n\nSynergism\nThe use of synergistic muscles (eg, finger flexors acting in concert with wrist extensors and finger extensors with wrist flexors) has been advocated for transfer. Muscle function is easier to retain after synergistic muscle transfer.\n\nExpendable donor\nThe removal of a tendon for transfer must not result in an unacceptable loss of function. Sufficient muscle must remain to substitute for the donor muscle.\n\nTiming of tendon transfer\nNo transfer should be performed until the local tissues are in optimal condition. The term often used to describe this is tissue equilibrium. Tissue is in equilibrium when soft-tissue induration has resolved, when any reaction in the wound is absent, when joints are supple, and when the scars are as soft as they are likely to become.\n\nTendon transfers function best when passed between subcutaneous fat and the deep fascial layer; they are not likely to be functional if placed in the pathway of a scar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

        "Wound Closure Technique": "\nOverview\n\n\nWound closure techniques have evolved from the earliest development of suturing materials to comprise resources that include synthetic sutures, absorbables, staples, tapes, and adhesive compounds. The engineering of sutures in synthetic material along with standardization of traditional materials (eg, catgut, silk) has made for superior aesthetic results. Similarly, the creation of topical skin adhesives (the monomer 2-octyl cyanoacrylate), surgical staples, and tapes to substitute for sutures has supplemented the armamentarium of wound closure techniques. Aesthetic closure of a wound, whether traumatic or surgically induced, is based on knowledge of healing mechanisms and skin anatomy (see the image below), as well as an appreciation of suture material and closure technique. Choosing the proper materials and wound closure technique ensures optimal healing.\n [1] \n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the skin. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nWound healing \n [2, 3] \nFour phases of wound healing have been identified and studied on the cellular and molecular level. As the field of molecular biology and genetics continues to broaden, the understanding of how wounds heal continues to improve dramatically. These four distinct phases are (1) hemostasis, (2) inflammatory phase, (3) proliferative (\"rebuilding\") phase, and (4) maturation phase. By understanding the phases of wound healing, the provider becomes more knowledgeable about the initial and subsequent care of wounds as well as how better to care for poorly healing wounds.\n\n\n\n\nThe initial injury leads to blood vessel disruption. Assuming normal thrombotic ability (ie, the patient is not taking medications that inhibit the clotting cascade, or has a preexisting genetic coagulopathy), once the collagen lining the vessels is exposed to blood, hemostasis ensues. This step involves the very complex intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways (discussed elsewhere). Clot formation occurs in minutes. Chemoattractants released by cells within the clot and injured vessel cause neutrophils and macrophages to be drawn to the site of injury. The inflammatory response in the wound happens within minutes to hours of development of the wound, and, as with all of the phases of wound healing, this phase overlaps with the next phase. Migration of epithelial cells has been shown to occur within the first 12-24 hours, but further new tissue formation occurs over the next 10-14 days.\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of the inflammatory cells (neutrophils and macrophages) and the local tissue mediators cannot be overstated. In order to preserve these cells and mediators, a wound should be minimally manipulated. Vigorous scrubbing and/or the use of cytotoxic fluids to irrigate a wound can impair and lengthen healing time. Products such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, diluted or otherwise), hydrogen peroxide, betadine, and alcohol should not be placed directly into a wound. These are all cytotoxic and will destroy inflammatory cells. Simple wound care with sterile water or saline should be used. If necessary, a syringe and intravenous catheter can be used to pressure wash contaminants from dirty wounds.\n\nEpithelialization and neovascularization (occurring within the overlap of proliferation and maturation phases) result from the increase in cellular activity. Stromal elements in the form of extracellular matrix materials are secreted and organized. This new tissue, called granulation tissue, depends on specific growth factors for further organization to occur in the completion of the healing process. This physiologic process occurs over several weeks to months in a healthy individual.\n\nFinally, tissue remodeling, in which wound contraction and tensile strength is achieved, occurs in the next 6-12 months. Systemic illness and local factors can affect wound healing. Traditionally, two types of wound healing have been described—primary intention and secondary intention.\n\nIn the primary intention method, surgical wound closure facilitates the biological event of healing by joining the wound edges. Surgical wound closure directly apposes the tissue layers, which serves to minimize new tissue formation within the wound. However, remodeling of the wound does occur, and tensile strength is achieved between the newly apposed edges. Closure can serve both functional and aesthetic purposes. These purposes include elimination of dead space by approximating the subcutaneous tissues, minimization of scar formation by careful epidermal and dermal alignment, and avoidance of a depressed scar by precise eversion of skin edges. If dead space is limited with opposed wound edges, then new tissue has limited room for growth. Correspondingly, atraumatic handling of tissues combined with avoidance of tight closures and undue tension contribute to a better result.\n\nThe secondary intention method (spontaneous healing) is ancient and well established. It can be used in lieu of complicated reconstruction for certain surgical defects. This method also depends on the four stages of wound healing to achieve the ultimate result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Wound Foreign Body Removal": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nPatients with skin and soft tissue wounds commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation and treatment. Essential in the evaluation of these wounds is a careful assessment for retained foreign bodies (FB), as they are frequently missed on initial evaluation.\n [1, 2] Identification of a foreign body can be difficult, depending on the type and location of the wound and the timing and mechanism of injury. Soft tissue foreign bodies most commonly occur secondary to penetrating or abrasive trauma, and they can result in patient discomfort, deformity, delayed wound healing, localized and systemic infection, and further trauma during attempts at removal.\n [1, 3, 4] See images below for examples of foreign body presentations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 3-mm hole in patient forearm (entrance).

Wound care is the subject of 5-20% of lawsuit claims against emergency medicine (EM) physicians, resulting in 3-11% of monetary awards.\n [5] \n\nHistory\nAssessment of a patient with a suspected foreign body begins with a careful history and physical examination. Patients who present with a wound or localized pain following trauma should be questioned regarding the specific timing and nature of the injury, the level of wound contamination, and any materials involved in the injury (eg, wood splinters, shattered glass, shredded metal). Foreign bodies detected in the ED are most commonly composed of wood, glass, or metal.\n [6] A careful assessment of the patient’s current symptoms should be made, including the location, quality, severity, and radiation of pain; the presence of a foreign body sensation; swelling, warmth, or redness to the wound; and any neurologic symptoms (including motor or sensory deficits).\n [4] Injuries involving the hands mandate asking about hand dominance, patient occupation, and previous hand injuries.\n\nAdditional historical information regarding tetanus immunization status, allergies (particularly to local anesthetics, antibiotics, and latex), preexisting medical conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, HIV/AIDS, chronic renal failure, connective tissue disorders), and medications (eg, steroids) that may influence rates of infection and wound healing should also be noted.\n [1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] \n\nIn most cases, foreign bodies are the result of accidental trauma directly to the skin and soft tissue; these events are usually readily recounted by the patient. However, if the injury resulted from other mechanisms, such as syncope, seizures, potential child or elder abuse, assault, or self-inflicted wounds, further investigation is required.\n [12, 13] Cases that involve solid, formed metallic objects obvious on examination (eg, nails, staples, needles) may require a less detailed history than an individual who presents with localized pain and foreign body sensation but is unaware of the timing and exact mechanism of injury (eg, resulting from syncope, seizure, or assault).\n [14] \n\nPhysical examination\nAs with any clinical scenario in emergency medicine, complete evaluation of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) is most important.\n\nPrior to wound examination, maximize lighting and patient positioning. Physical examination of the affected area should adequately assess for nerve, tendon, vessel, and joint involvement. Perform a vascular assessment focusing on color, capillary refill, and palpation of distal pulses. A neurologic examination should include testing of the surrounding and distally distributed nerves and assessing 2-point discrimination. Evaluate functional status, concentrating on potentially involved muscles, tendons, and joints.\n [1, 4] A functional assessment of movement helps to refine the potential musculoskeletal damage that may have occurred during injury and FB deposition. A complete physical examination should be performed to avoid missing any other injuries.\n\nProviding local anesthetic (ie, digital block) prior to wound inspection and irrigation is essential for patient comfort and in obtaining a more comprehensive examination. Local anesthetics should not be applied prior to careful evaluation and documentation of neurovascular status of the affected area. Foreign bodies such as a nail protruding through a foot may be obvious; however, foreign bodies are more often subtle, such as a small shred of metal imbedded in a fingertip during the opening of a can. If no wound is present, a close visual inspection of the area of localized pain is the first step in determining whether a foreign body is visible. Levine et al demonstrated that 78% of foreign bodies were discovered after physical examination and exploration alone, without the use of imaging.\n [6] \n\nTo achieve adequate visualization, a hemostatic field of the wound should be established using either direct pressure, a properly placed tourniquet proximal to the wound, or application of newer hemostatic agents such as Gelfoam or QuickClot (Z-Medica Corp, Wallingford, Conn).\n [15, 16, 17] Note and document wound characteristics, including location, size, color, level of contamination, signs of inflammation (edema, erythema), and presence and type of visible foreign bodies. Obvious skin punctures should not distract the examiner from less obvious areas potentially harboring retained foreign bodies, such as areas where skin may be tenting, edematous, or otherwise normal in appearance. Carefully palpate for a foreign body or a point of maximal tenderness. Palpation of a foreign body may also yield information regarding its exact location, positioning, and orientation, as well as its flexibility and mobility.\n [18] \n\nDelayed presentation\nForeign bodies are frequently missed during the initial evaluation, and not all patients present immediately following an injury. In one retrospective study, nearly 38% of patients had foreign bodies that were missed on initial wound inspection.\n [2] Another study found that only 75% of soft tissue foreign bodies were presented within 48 hours, while patients with the remaining 25% presented weeks, months, and even years later.\n [6] Additional reports have demonstrated subcutaneous soft tissue foreign bodies from splinters to bullet fragments found years after the traumatic event (eg, gunshot wound).\n [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] Delayed foreign bodies can present as localized cellulitis, abscess, or regional inflammatory response. A history of recurrent localized infections should prompt a search for an occult foreign body and should include a discussion of recent or remote trauma that could have resulted in a foreign body.\n [18, 20, 21, 27] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Wound Healing and Growth Factors": "\nOverview\n\n\nTremendous advancements have been made in understanding the processes of wound healing. The cell types and the order in which they appear in the wound have been established; many growth factors and their functions have been elucidated.\n [1] Despite the advances in understanding the science of wound healing, many more steps have yet to be discovered and elucidated. The frontier of this field includes the prevention of hypertrophic and keloid scar formation and, ultimately, any visual remnant of the wound.\nAn incision created by a scalpel, trauma resulting from a bullet, or tissue death caused by a myocardial infarction all undergo a similar and predictable reparative process. Understanding how the body repairs damaged tissue and what factors influence the wound healing process helps the surgeon ensure an acceptable outcome from surgery.\n\n\nTissue injury is common thread to every medical specialty. Wound healing in any tissue follows a predictable sequence of events. A broad understanding of the sequence of events, cells involved, relative time table, and molecular signaling can allow for maximum optimization of this important patient care issue.\nAlthough seemingly basic in concept, advances in molecular science have allowed modern medicine to gain a true appreciation of the complex interplay between the cells involved in the phases of wound healing. As greater understanding of the growth factors involved in wound healing emerges, future patient care may include scarless wound healing and transplant of tissues engineered from stem cell progenitors.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Wound Irrigation": "\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\nWound irrigation is the steady flow of a solution across an open wound surface to achieve wound hydration, to remove deeper debris, and to assist with the visual examination. The irrigation solution is meant to remove cellular debris and surface pathogens contained in wound exudates or residue from topically applied wound care products. Compared to swabbing or bathing, wound irrigation is considered to be the most consistently effective method of wound cleansing.\n [1] \n\n\nNormal wound healing is characterized by 3 interrelated phases: inflammatory, proliferative or fibroplastic, and remodeling. In normal wound healing, infectious microorganisms, foreign debris, and necrotic tissue are removed from the wound during the inflammatory phase due to vascular and cellular responses to trauma. However, weaknesses in the body’s inflammatory response can cause deficits in its ability to overpower surface microorganisms. This can lead to delayed angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation, as well as infection. Contaminating microorganisms can upset collagen synthesis and modify matrix metalloproteinases, leading to anoxia and impeding neutrophil and macrophage function.\nCombined with debridement, irrigation is a critical step in facilitating progression from the inflammatory to proliferative phase of wound healing by removing debris that can impede the healing process. When performed properly, wound irrigation can aid in wound healing from the inside tissue layers outward to the skin surface. It may also help prevent premature surface healing over an abscess pocket or infected tract.\n [2] The goal of irrigation is to clean the wound while avoiding trauma to wound bed and minimizing risk of driving bacteria further into the wound bed.\n\n\n\n\nKey considerations - Selecting an irrigation solution\nChoosing an appropriate solution is a critical step in wound irrigation. Solutions intended for topical use include topical cleansers, antibiotics, antifungals, antiseptics and anesthetics. Ideally, an irrigant should be isotonic, nonhemolytic, nontoxic, transparent, easy to sterilize, and inexpensive. Unfortunately, such a solution does not yet exist. Current literature generally favors use of normal saline. Many antiseptics and antibiotics have been employed, but the ideal additive is the subject of debate. Cytotoxicity of the solution should certainly be considered. In particular, antiseptic solutions, such as povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and hydrogen peroxide, may be toxic to tissues and may negatively influence acute wound healing. Some conventional topical irrigants are discussed below.\n\n\n\n\nNormal saline\n\nNormal saline is isotonic and the most commonly used wound irrigation solution due to safety (lowest toxicity) and physiologic factors. A disadvantage is that it does not cleanse dirty, necrotic wounds as effectively as other solutions. Similar wound infection rates have been reported with potable tap water versus saline in adult and pediatric populations.\n [3, 4, 5] It is important to note the date of opening a saline container, as bacterial growth in saline may be present within 24 hours of opening the container.\n\nSterile water\n\nPrepared by distillation, sterile water is nonpyrogenic and contains no antimicrobial or bacteriostatic agents or added buffers. It is often used in irrigation, particularly in developing countries, as a less expensive alternative to isotonic saline. Sterile water is hypotonic and may cause hemolysis and will be readily absorbed by the tissues during surgical procedures; therefore, its use under such conditions is not recommended. Water toxicity may result when excess volumes are used.\n\nPotable water\n\nPotable water is recommended in the event that normal saline or sterile water are not available. Its use is particularly attractive in austere environments. In fact, a few studies have shown potable water to be as effective at reducing bacterial counts as normal saline.\n\nCommercial wound cleansers\n\nCommercial wound cleansers are increasingly used in irrigation. Detergent irrigation is meant to remove, rather than kill, bacteria and has seen promising results in animal models of the complex contaminated musculoskeletal wound.\n [6] Due to the surfactant content in cleansers, less force is required to remove bacteria and cellular debris. Thus, cleansers may be best suited for wounds with adherent cellular debris or in dirty, necrotic wounds. Trigger sprays can help direct the cleanser more effectively and safely. Cleansers typically contain preservatives to slow growth of bacteria, molds, and fungi, and extend product shelf life.\n\nPovidone iodine\n\nPovidone iodine is a broad spectrum antimicrobial solution effective against a variety of pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus. However, similar wound infection rates have been reported in adult and pediatric populations with saline irrigation versus 1% povidone-iodine.\n [3, 4, 7, 8] A disadvantage is its cytotoxicity to healthy cells and granulating tissues. The solution dries and tends to discolor skin. It may also cause local irritation to the periwound skin.\n\nHydrogen peroxide\n\nA 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide is a commonly used wound antiseptic. However, few studies report on its efficacy in wound healing and as an antiseptic, and its use remains controversial. While some studies have shown hydrogen peroxide to be cytotoxic to healthy cells and granulating tissues, other animal and human studies have shown no negative effect on wound healing.\n [9, 10, 11] Several studies have also shown hydrogen peroxide to be ineffective in reducing bacterial count.\n [10] The American Medical Association summarized that the effervescing cleansing action of hydrogen peroxide may act as a chemical debriding agent to help lift debris and necrotic tissue from the wound surface when used at full strength.\n [12] If used, irrigation with normal saline after full-strength hydrogen peroxide use is recommended. Use of hydrogen peroxide is not recommended in wounds with sinus tracts.\n\nSodium hypochlorite\n\nSodium hypochlorite (ie, Dakin’s solution) has been classically used in pressure ulcers with necrotic tissue to help control infection. Sodium hypochlorite is known to have a bactericidal effect against most organisms commonly found in open wounds. It is occasionally used over cancerous growths to control bacteria and minimize odor. However, the solution is known to be cytotoxic to healthy cells and granulating tissues, and its use is not recommended for periods longer than 7-10 days.\n\nKey considerations - Selecting method of solution delivery to the wound\nThe ideal irrigation technique and pressure required for optimal outcome are still undetermined in the literature.\n [13] Equipment used for irrigation includes bulb syringes, piston syringes, pressure canisters, whirlpool agitator, whirlpool hose sprayer, irrigation fluid in plastic containers with a pour cap or nozzle, and pulsed lavage (eg, jet lavage, mechanical lavage, pulsatile lavage, mechanical irrigation, high-pressure irrigation).\n\nContinuous irrigation is the uninterrupted stream of irrigant to the wound’s surface. Pulsed irrigation is the intermittent or interrupted pressurized delivery of an irrigant, typically measured by the number of pulses per second. Power-pulsed lavage is a wound irrigation system that uses an electrically powered pump system to deliver a high volume of irrigation solution under pressure. Outcomes of pulsed versus continuous pressure appear to be similar.\n\nAdvantages of pressurized canisters compared to traditional methods of irrigation include speed, simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Semirigid ampoules and pressurized canisters also allow practitioners to irrigate wounds without the risk of needle-stick injuries. Disadvantages include the reliability of canisters and difficulties in warming contents to consistent ambient temperature.\n\nKey considerations - Choosing a sufficient pressure\nThe amount of pressure used in wound irrigation appears to be a determining factor in successful wound cleansing, yet a paucity of well-supported literature exists regarding optimal irrigant pressure. High pressure is often used to describe acute wound irrigation; however, pressure parameters have varied within this definition. For the purposes of this discussion, high-pressure lavage, usually performed using syringes and needles, is 35-70 pounds per square inch (psi), and low-pressure irrigation is 1-15 psi, as defined by the American College of Surgeons.\n [14] \n\nSeminal studies of high-pressure pulsating jet lavage (70 psi) indicated it is more effective in reducing bacterial populations and removing necrotic tissue and foreign particles versus bulb syringe and other low-pressure systems.\n [15, 16] However, especially in chronic wounds, high pressure irrigation systems have been shown to damage granulation and epithelial tissue or cause discomfort to the patient. In all wounds, high pressure may also drive bacteria into deeper compartments, causing increased risk of infection, particularly in highly vascularized areas such as the scalp and face.\n\nComplications of high-pressure irrigation in acute bone and joint surgery include visibly damaged bone, intramedullary seeding of bacteria, and delayed healing of the fracture by lavage of the fracture zone.\n [17] With high-pressure lavage, a possibility exists of pushing surface contaminants into the mucosal epithelium.\n\nOriginal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guidelines describe safe and effective irrigation pressures as being 4-15 psi, based on a series of different studies.\n [16, 18, 19] Pressures greater than 15 psi may cause wound trauma and drive bacteria further into wounds. These authors recommend using a 35-mL piston syringe with an 18-gauge or 19-gauge tip for irrigation. A syringe with an attached 19-gauge needle typically delivers an output pressure range of 11-31 psi; however, the end pressure that reaches the wound could be as low as 8 psi.\n [20, 21] \n\nStudies suggest that pressures of 8-12 psi are strong enough to overcome adhesive forces of bacteria;\n [3, 21] however, maintaining consistent pressure across the tissue beds has long been challenging to control. Owens et al concluded from a controlled animal study that use of a low-pressure device and saline solution to irrigate wounds is the best choice in maintaining bacteria clearance longer than 48 hours.\n [22] Earlier versus later (3 hours versus 12 hours) irrigation in a contaminated wound model has also been reported to result in superior bacterial removal.\n [23] \n\nAlthough current evidence appears to support greater advantages with low-pressure wound irrigation, pressures lower than 4 psi have been found to be insufficient in removing surface pathogens and debris. Needle and syringe-generated pressures of 13 psi have been found to be more effective in reducing inflammation and infection when compared to a bulb syringe.\n [21] Manually squeezing punctured containers of irrigation fluid is inadequate for pressure irrigation. In general, wound soaking without suction is not effective in cleaning contaminated wounds and may increase wound bacterial counts.\n\nIn summary, the benefits of higher pressures in reducing bacterial count, dirt, and tissue debris in heavily contaminated wounds may outweigh the risk of tissue injury. In relatively clean wounds, the potential damage of tissue resulting from high-pressure irrigation may outweigh the benefits.\n [13] \n\nKey considerations - Using sufficient volume\nIncreased volume improves wound cleansing to a point, but optimal volume in wound irrigation remains largely understudied. Volumes of 50-100 mL per centimeter of laceration length or per square centimeter of a wound are commonly reported in the literature.\n [3, 24] \n\nImportantly, irrigation volume should be determined according to wound characteristics and degree of contamination. In the case of more contaminated wounds, the wounds should be irrigated until all visible debris is removed. Copious amounts of potable tap water or saline should be used for irrigation and decontamination of chemical burns.\n [25] \n\nKey considerations - Precautions and protection against splashback\nIrrigation, particularly high pressure, can splash and spread bacteria to surrounding areas and people. The use of a plastic shield at the end of the irrigating syringe reduces this hazard. Where needed, a face shield, mask, and protection over scrubs is advised. IV sites and other open areas should be protected from splashing.\n\nIndications\nMost wounds should be irrigated initially and at each dressing change. All wound surfaces should be irrigated, which may require opening wound edges and flaps for exposure. Wounds should be irrigated again upon re-examination.\n\nPrecautions and contraindications\nPulsed lavage should not be performed over exposed blood vessels, nerves, tendons, or bone.\n\nPulsed lavage should not be performed in the presence of active, profuse bleeding (precautionary measures for patients on anticoagulation medication).\n\nImproper technique may harm the wound bed.\n\nPatients with sensory impairment are unable to provide accurate feedback needed to guide the clinician if improper technique is used.\n\nHydrodebridement\nHydrodebridement is the synchronous application of an irrigant in tandem with debridement. Particularly in the presence of thick exudate, slough, or necrotic tissue, hydrodebridement may aid in cleansing and mechanical debridement. Both low-pressure and high-pressure methods of hydrodebridement have been used to optimize the effects of debridement, reduce bioburden, and manage exudate—all integral parts of wound bed preparation.\n\nAn emerging application of low-pressure hydrodebridement is in tandem with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Some NPWT systems are equipped with technology that allows automatic instillation of topical solutions to be delivered and removed from the wound site during NPWT. This technology is indicated for patients who would benefit from vacuum-assisted drainage and controlled delivery of topical wound treatment solutions and suspensions over the wound bed. NPWT can be used with a range of solutions intended for topical use, including cleansers, antibiotics, antifungals, antiseptics, and anesthetics. Regular instillation of topical solutions during NPWT can assist with wound cleansing, irrigation, pain, and removal of infectious material.\n [25]  See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWound receiving negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and solution instillation. \n\n\nInstilling solutions with NPWT increases the viscosity of the wound fluid and allows more efficient removal through the reticulated open-cell foam dressing and into the canister. Solutions are delivered continuously or at timed intervals, and are gravity fed, or intermittently pumped into the wound, depending upon the NPWT system. Wounds with significant debris and bacterial contamination can be irrigated when needed at increased pressures (fluid delivered at 8-12 psi such as with a 35 mL syringe and a 19-gauge angiocatheter) during NPWT dressing changes.\n\nNPWT with solution instillation has been advocated in cases of diffuse or extensively treated osteomyelitis, large areas of postdebrided exposed bone or joint, and in cases of critical bacterial colonization levels as an alternative to antibiotic-impregnated beads when appropriate.\n [26] Anecdotal evidence suggests topical solution instillation may enhance the efficacy of NPWT in cases of high levels of exudate and slough content, as well as acute traumatic wounds or wounds acutely debrided due to infected hardware or soft tissue.\n [27, 28] However, large controlled studies are needed to substantiate the effects of solution instillation with NPWT.\n\nAlthough topical antibiotics are commonly used in wound infection prophylaxis and treatment, well-controlled research supporting optimal topical antibiotic treatment regimens is lacking. In addition, risk of antibiotic resistance is an ongoing concern in the practice of topical antibiotic use. The overall effectiveness of topical antibiotics is a subject of hot debate that is beyond the scope of this article. The authors support short-term use of appropriate topical antibiotic solutions, such as vancomycin, bacitracin, and silver-based solutions (silver nitrate) with NPWT in wounds that require antimicrobial therapy for management. Continuous hydrocleansing has been reported to impede formation of biofilms that allows bacteria to adhere to wound surfaces.\n [29] Evidence suggests these biofilms gain resistance to antimicrobial treatments over time and that selected topical antibiotics may be most effective within 24 hours of sharp debridement.\n [30] \n\nSolutions that contain hydrogen peroxide or alcohol should not be used with NPWT reticulated open-cell foam. Also, according to manufacturer’s guidelines, instillation of fluids into thoracic or abdominal cavities is not recommended due to the potential risk of altered core body temperature and fluid retention within the cavity. In addition, topical wound solutions should not be infused into wounds with unexplored tunnels or undermining because the solutions may enter into unintended cavities.\n\nHigh-pressure hydrodebridement, or hydrosurgery, combines lavage and sharp debridement instrumentation. This technology is used to soften and mechanically debride devitalized tissue, often prior to reconstruction. Modern hydrosurgical devices project a high-velocity, razor-thin saline jet stream, capable of cutting tissue, across an operating window into an evacuation canister, creating a localized vacuum. The saline beam is aimed parallel to the wound so that the cutting mechanism is a highly selective form of tangential excision. Suction allows the surgeon to hold and cut targeted tissue while aspirating debris from the site. In this way, selective debridement of necrotic and damaged tissues is facilitated, and viable and peripheral tissue is spared.\n\nAdvantages of hydrosurgical tools are ease of use, precision, speed and safety in wound cleansing. Excision of contoured areas, web spaces, and facial structures may be improved with the technology. Hydrosurgery is most beneficial when the tissue to be removed is softer than the tissue that should remain intact. For example, debriding desiccated eschar in pressure sores covered with dry eschar is not effective.\n [31] Results of one study showed a significant increase in bacterial air contamination following debridement with a hydrosurgery tool; appropriate precautions should be taken.\n [32] Further controlled studies are required to investigate the cost-effectiveness of high pressure hydrodebridement in wound management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n"

        "Donor Nephrectomy": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nSince 1988, over 517,246 kidney transplants have been performed in the United States. During 2021, a record number of kidney transplants were performed in the US, including 24,669 kidney-alone and 820 kidney plus at least one additional organ. Of those transplants, 5970 were identified as originating from living-donors (24.2%) and 19,519 (76.5%) from deceased-donors.\n [1] In 2019, more than 244,000 patients were alive and with a functioning transplanted kidney; currently, more than 100,000 adult patients are waiting for kidney transplants.\n [2] \nDonor nephrectomy is done via either a laparoscopic or an open surgical approach. This article describes the 2 most common approaches: transperitoneal laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) and microinvasive open donor nephrectomy (MDN). Laparoscopic surgery takes longer than open nephrectomy but provides a more rapid recovery for the donor. The vast majority of living-donor nephrectomies are now performed laparoscopically, with donors discharged from the hospital about 48 hours following the surgery. The left kidney is preferred for living-donor nephrectomy because the renal vein is longer on the left. However, when vascular, urological or other abnormalities are present, the right kidney may be procured.\n [3] \n\n\nLDN can be transperitoneal or retroperitoneal  and the kidney is usually removed by enlarging the umbilical port incision. MDN, an open approach to donor nephrectomy, is commonly performed through a small flank incision, without rib resection. \nThe subsequent advance in LDN was the laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) procedure. In this operation, a single access port (eg, GelPOINT) is inserted into the abdomen through a 5-cm incision, and the laparoscopic instruments are triangulated through the gel-covered port. More recent techniques use a 2-port or mini-laparoscopic approach.\n [4, 5, 6]   The feasibility of the LESS procedure may be limited by the patient's body habitus (eg, high body mass index or previous abdominal surgical procedures), the ability of the surgeon to triangulate the instruments effectively, and the presence of multiple renal arteries. Thus, the 2-port laparoscopic procedure allows better triangulation while maintaining cosmesis without differences in perioperative patient outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical guidelines (2019) recommend “mini-open” laparoscopy or hand-assisted laparoscopy by trained surgeons as the optimal approaches for living-donor nephrectomy.  In select circumstances, such as donors with extensive previous surgery or adhesions, and at centers where laparoscopy is not routinely performed, open nephrectomy (flank or laparotomy) may be acceptable. Robotic, single-port, and natural orifice transluminal nephrectomy are not recommended for donor nephrectomy.\n [3]   \n\n\n\n\nHowever, in 2021 Garden and colleagues reported successful robotic single-port donor nephrectomy in a seriers of 7 patients using the da Vinci SP® Surgical System, with no Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ III complications within 90 days. Pain scores at 48 hours postoperatively averaged 1.7/10. The da Vinci SP® Surgical System is approved for use in urologic procedures and uses a single, 25 mm multichannel trocar containing a high-definition, 3D robotic camera, and three instrument slots that deploy intracorporeally.\n [7] \n\nTransvaginal nephrectomy has also been attempted but has not gained widespread acceptance. A few studies have evaluated LDN with vaginal extraction. Incisions made through the natural orifice of the vagina are thought to yield better cosmesis and less postoperative pain. An endoscopic specimen retrieval bag (eg, EndoCatch) is used to retrieve the kidney, and an episiotomy is made to facilitate this removal.\n [8]  The main points of debate concerning this procedure have to do with the infectious complications of transvaginal removal, the issues involved in removing large kidneys, and the use of nulliparous donors.\n\nAdditional information can be obtained from the following sources:\n\n\n\n\n\nUNOS\n\n\n\n\nOrgan Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)\n         \n\n\n\nLiving Organ Donor Network (LODN)\n         \n\n\n\n          US Department of Health and Human Services: \n          Organ Donation Information\n\n\n\n\nScientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR)\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",

Proper execution of these steps can culminate in an extremely satisfying outcome for both the physician and patient.\n [6] \n\nCandidates for cardiac transplantation generally present with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III (moderate) symptoms or class IV (severe) symptoms.\n [7] Evaluation demonstrates ejection fractions of less than 25%.

        "Intestinal and Multivisceral Transplantation": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nParenteral nutrition remains the standard of care for most patients with intestinal failure. Currently, only limited numbers of intestinal transplants are performed in pediatric patients, as a result of advancements in intestinal rehabilitation programs and stagnant long-term outcomes of intestinal transplantation.\n [1] Similarly, in adults, advances in the medical and surgical treatment of intestinal failure have reduced the need for transplantation, and no significant improvement in survival has been seen in transplant recipients since 2005.\n [2] Nevertheless, intestinal transplants can be lifesaving in patients with severe complications from parenteral nutrition.

At first, all patients on TPN required continuous hospitalization.\n [3, 4] Currently, TPN is safely used in outpatient management. Pooled data from the North American Home Parenteral and Enteral Patient Registry showed 1- and 4-year survival rates for patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who received TPN at home to be 94% and 80%, respectively. Only 5-11% of deaths were directly attributed to TPN, with the vast majority of deaths related to progression of the underlying primary disease.\n [5] \nThe success of TPN supplanted the then-urgent need to find solutions for the problems with intestinal transplantation, and TPN became the standard of care. Subsequently, intestinal transplantation has been offered to that minority of the patients on long-term TPN who have severe and life-threatening complications related to this therapy.\n [6, 7] These TPN-related complications include the following\n [8] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Impending or overt liver failure related to TPN (parenteral nutrition–associated liver disease [PNALD)\n         \n\n\n\n          Impending loss of vascular access for TPN administration\n         \n\n\n\n          Multiple episodes of catheter-related sepsis\n         \n\n\n\n          A single episode of life-threatening catheter-related sepsis\n         \n\n\n\n          Frequent episodes of significant dehydration despite supplemental fluid administration \n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements in surgical technique, the monitoring and diagnosis of rejection, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis and the development of improved immunosuppression have paved the way for signiicant improvements in patient and graft survival rates.

Marked improvements in early graft survival and long-term graft function have made kidney transplantation a more cost-effective alternative to dialysis.\nSince 1988, over 515,000 kidney transplants have been performed in the United States.\n [1]  During 2019, a record 24,502 kidney transplants were performed in the US, 6915 from living donors and 17,586 from deceased-donors.\n [2] In 2019, 244,000 patients (pediatric and adult) were alive and with a functioning transplanted kidney; at the end of 2019, 101,337 adult patients were waiting for kidney transplants.\n [3] Although the spring 2020 wave of the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted kidney transplantation, rates subsequently recovered; however, kidney transplant recipients have experienced excess mortality through the pandemic, possibly due to lower vaccine efficacy in this population.\n [4, 5, 6] \n\n\nBefore the advent of immunosuppression, kidney transplantation was limited to identical twins and was not applicable to the vast majority of patients with ESRD. The introduction of combined azathioprine-steroid therapy in 1963 produced encouraging results and became the mainstay of immunosuppression. Although this therapy improved the results of transplantation, acute rejection and complications associated with steroid therapy persisted.\nThe introduction of cyclosporine in 1983 significantly improved the outcomes of all solid-organ transplants by reducing the risk of rejection. Further innovations, including anti–T cell antibodies (both monoclonal and polyclonal preparations), as well as other maintenance immunosuppressants (eg, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, sirolimus), have made a significant impact on both patient and graft survival. Currently, 1-year patient and graft survival rates exceed 90% in most transplant centers.\n\n\n\n\nFor patient education information, see Kidney Transplant and the Mayo Clinic's kidney transplant information Web page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Kidney-Pancreas Transplantation": "\nOverview\n\n\nThe main goal of pancreas transplantation is to ameliorate insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) and produce complete independence from injected insulin.\n [1] Simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation (see the image below) is the primary option if the patient also has diabetic nephropathy and qualifies for listing for a kidney transplant. The first successful human pancreas transplant along with a kidney transplant was performed in 1966 at the University of Minnesota by Dr. William Kelly and Dr. Richard Lillehei. In 2020, 872 pancreas-kidney transplants were performed in the United States.\n [2]  \n\n\n\n\n\nKidney-pancreas allograft placement\n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 34.2 million people—10.5% of the total United States population—have diabetes mellitus. However, 21.4% of all US adults who met laboratory criteria for diabetes were not aware of or did not report having diabetes. Of the estimated 88 million US adults with prediabetes, only 15.3% are aware of their condition; however, awareness of prediabetes doubled between 2005–2008 and 2013-2016. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the US, and each year, over 58,000 people develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with diabetes as the primary cause.\n [3] \nThis article focuses on SPK transplantation. For complete discussion of kidney transplantation, see Pediatric Kidney Transplantation and Kidney Transplantation.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) implemented a new system for matching kidney and pancreas transplant candidates with organs from deceased donors. Instead of distribution based on donation service area and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) region, the new system uses the distance between the donor and transplant hospitals for each candidate. Kidney-pancreas transplants will be offered first to candidates listed at transplant hospitals within 250 nautical miles of the donor hospital. Offers not accepted for any of these candidates will then be made for candidates beyond the 250 nautical-mile distance.\n [4] \n\n\n\n\nForms of pancreas transplantation\nA donor pancreas may be used for endocrine replacement therapy in one of the following ways:\n\n1. Pancreas transplant alone (PTA): Indicated for patients with type 1 diabetes who have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia with or without unawareness, impaired quality of life, or other issues with insulin therapy tolerance. These patients have adequate kidney function and kidney transplantation is not indicated.\n\n2. SPK transplant: The organs are from the same donor. The primary use has been in patients with type 1 diabetes who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 or are on renal replacement therapy, but patients with type 2 diabetes make up an increasing percentage of SPK transplant recipients. \n\n3. Pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK): Deceased donor pancreas transplantation after a previous kidney transplant; indications are similar to those for PTA\n [5] \n\n4. Pancreatic islet cell transplantation: Offers lower morbidity but inferior long-term results compared with solid organ (pancreas) transplantation.\n\nAbout 86% of pancreas transplantations are performed as an SPK transplantation.\n [2]  Approximately 10% of pancreas transplantations are performed as a PAK transplant after a previously successful kidney transplantation from a living or deceased donor. The remaining cases are performed as PTA.\n [6, 7, 8, 9] \n\nPancreas and islet transplantation can be considered complementary transplant options and undergoing one or the other is not mutually exclusive. In an analysis of 40 pancreas transplantations (50% PTA, 27.5% SPK, 22.5% PAK) after islet cell transplantation graft failure, overall survival rates  (97% at 1 year and 83% at 5 years) were not adversely affected.\n [10]  \n\nTransplantation assessment testing\nIn evaluating a patient for SPK transplantation eligibility, the quantification of daily insulin requirement is used to determine the type of diabetes present, the severity of insulin resistance, and the possible benefit of pancreas transplantation. A highly insulin-resistant patient will have a high insulin requirement (> 1-1.5 units/kg) and a high fasting C-peptide level (> 4 ng/mL).  These patients might remain insulin dependent despite a pancreas transplant.\n\nHowever, these values must be considered within the overall clinical picture. For example, a patient on peritoneal dialysis with dextrose-containing dialysate will have greater insulin requirements that will decrease once kidney transplantation eliminates the need for dialysis. C-peptide is not an exact marker in patients with chronic kidney disase, as it has varying clearance in these patients. In addition, in a patient who is taking insulin, the C-peptide level will be falsely low if the sample is drawn when the patient is hypoglycemic; thus, the C-peptide result must be interpreted in light of a concomitant glucose measurement.\n\nHemoglobin A1C should be measured, to assess the severity of the patient's diabetes. \n\nIf the patient has a type 1 diabetes, consider baseline assessment of autoimmune markers, including antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase. A rise in the antibody level after pancreas transplantation would suggest possible pancreas graft dysfunction and hyperglycemia due to an autoimmune reaction as opposed to rejection.\n [11] \n\nIndications and contraindications\nThe number of pancreas transplants has decreased every year since 2004, when approximately 1500 were performed; 135 pancreas transplants were performed in 2020. The most common multi-organ transplantation is kidney-pancreas, with nearly 23,000 performed between 1988 and 2017.\n [12]  In 2020, 827 SPK transplantations were performed.\n [13] Patients with type 2 diabetes make up an increasing proportion of SPK transplantations, accounting for 17% of cases in 2019.\n [2] \n\nin July 2019, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) and the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) made a proposal to change the allocation system and waiting time criteria for kidney-pancreas transplant candidates. The OPTN/UNOS proposal suggested removing body mass index (BMI) and C-peptide level from the waiting time criteria.\n [14]  The rationale behind these changes was that BMI is confusing and undermines transparency and that it was too restrictive for certain candidates with a high BMI. It was also concluded that the existing criteria were limiting access to transplantation for suitable candidates, particularly those from minority populations. \n\nAs per the OPTN/UNOS guidelines,\n [14]  if a kidney-pancreas candidate is 18 years or older on the date the candidate is registered for a kidney-pancreas, then the candidate begins to accrue waiting time once the candidate has met all of the following conditions:\n\n\n\nThe candidate is registered for a kidney-pancreas\n\nThe candidate qualifies for kidney waiting time\n\nThe candidate is on insulin \n\n\nThe following are the criteria for the specific type of pancreas transplant:\n\n\n\n\n\n          PTA - Frequent, acute metabolic complications, including hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis; inability to tolerate exogenous insulin therapy; and persistence of acute complications despite insulin-based management\n         \n\n\n\n          SPK - ESKD and eligibility for pancreas transplant\n         \n\n\n\n          PAK - Pancreas transplant eligibility and a previous successful kidney transplant\n         \n\n\nThe eligible patient will also have to undergo appropriate medical evaluation, in particular for cardiovascular risk stratification and peripheral vascular disease. They will also have to show a history of medical adherence.\n [15] The historical age limit for pancreas transplantation, which some centers have continued to employ, is 55 years. However, the number of pancreas transplant recipients older than 55 years has steadily increased. In 2019, 24.9% of all pancreas transplant recipients were older than 50 years (PTA: 33.3%, SPK: 24.5%, PAK: 22.8%).\n [2]  Patient survival is comparable for younger and older pancreas transplant recipients but older recipients have had more frequent cardiovascular events.\n [16] ​ \n\nAbsolute contraindications, as follows, are similar to those for other solid organ transplantation:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Excessive cardiovascular risk\n         \n\n\n\n          Active malignancy or infection that would have to be treated and cleared prior to transplant\n         \n\n\n\n          High social risk factors such as medication non-adherence, lack of insurance, and illicit drug use\n         \n\n\nRelative contraindications include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          BMI > 30-35 kg/m\n          2\n\n\n\n\n          Insulin requirement of >1.5 U/kg per day\n         \n\n\n\n          Cerebrovascular, aortic/iliac, cardiovascular, or peripheral vascular disease\n         \n\n\nBenefits of pancreas transplantation\nThe microvascular complications of diabetes are directly related to glucose concentration. Thus, normalizing glucose through successful pancreas transplantation might be expected to stabilize or reverse microvascular complications. The resulting benefits of pancreas and kidney transplantation are discussed below.\n\nDiabetic retinopathy\n\nMost pancreas transplantation candidates have had diabetes for 20-25 years on average prior to consideration for transplantation and consequently, many of them have had laser surgery for retinopathy. This was a common peritransplantation finding in most studies. The severity of these ophthalmologic changes may obviate a clear salutary effect of PTA or SPK transplantation on retinopathy.\n\nStudies suggest, however, that retinopathy may improve 3 years after SPK and that the need for further laser surgery is less after SPK than kidney transplantation alone (KTA). It is thought that pancreas transplantation and maintaining a euglycemic state at minimum stabilizes diabetic retinopathy. Prospective trials are needed to compare the two groups, because most studies have lacked sufficient control groups.\n [17, 18, 19] \n\nDiabetic nephropathy\n\nSignificant numbers of pancreas transplantation candidates have advanced renal disease. The most common scenario for pancreas transplantation is in combination with a kidney transplant to treat patients with diabetic uremia. SPK would help to prevent the deleterious effects of diabetes on the new kidney transplant. \n\nStudies comparing kidney function in SPK transplantation recipients versus diabetic KTA recipients did not demonstrate significant differences during the early posttransplant period. However, recurrent diabetic nephropathy is observed as early as 2 years after KTA in a diabetic recipient or upon failure of the pancreas graft after SPK but has never been reported with a functioning SPK transplant.\n [20]   Patients with a pancreas transplant have been shown to have delayed progresssion or reversal of diabetic nephropathy.\n [21] \n\nDiabetic neuropathy\n\nNeuropathy improves after both kidney and pancreas transplantation, suggesting that kidney failure and diabetes contribute to the sensory neuropathy commonly observed at the time of transplantation. Autonomic neuropathies such as gastroparesis takes years to develop and can be difficult to quantitate. However, objective improvement in autonomic neuropathic findings has been reported 4 years following SPK and is noted to be greater after SPK than after KTA.\n [22, 23, 24, 25, 26] \n\nCardiovascular disease\n\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes with renal failure.  Few prospective studies have examined the relationship between the establishment of normoglycemia in patients with long-term diabetes and a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In one cross-sectional study, left ventricular ejection fraction was higher, peak filling rate to peak ejection rate ratio was greater, and endothelium-dependent dilatation of the brachial artery was improved in SPK recipients compared with type 1 diabetes patients who received KTA.\n [27, 28, 29]  Other evidence shows that SPK transplantation reduces cardiovascular death rates with concomitant reduction in blood pressure.\n [19]  \n\nAnother study observed a greater decrease in left ventricular mass and greater normalization of diastolic dysfunction in SPK recipients than in those who underwent KTA. In this report, 2-dimensional (2-D) and M-mode echocardiography was performed before and 1 year after transplantation in SPK and KTA recipients.\n [30]  A large, retrospective study suggested an association with reductions in the incidence of myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary edema, and hypertension in SPK versus KTA recipients.\n [31] \n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most important comorbidity to consider in patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Patients with diabetes and ESKD are estimated to carry an estimated 50-fold greater risk for cardiovascular events than the general population. The prevalence of significant CAD (>50% stenosis) in patients with diabetes who are starting treatment for ESKD is estimated to be 45-55%.\n [28, 32]  Because of diabetic neuropathy, patients may not experience angina during episodes of myocardial ischemia.\n\nStroke and transient ischemic attack\n\nPatients with ESKD and diabetes have an increased rate of strokes and transient ischemic attacks. Deaths related to cerebral vascular disease in patients with ESKD are approximately twice as common in those with diabetes as in those without diabetes. Strokes occur more frequently and at a younger age in patients with diabetes than in age- and gender-matched nondiabetic patients.\n\nPeripheral vascular disease\n\nLower-extremity peripheral vascular disease is significant in patients with diabetes. Patients with ESKD are at risk for amputation of a lower extremity. These problems typically begin with a foot ulcer associated with advanced somatosensory neuropathy.\n\nAutonomic neuropathy\n\nAutonomic neuropathy is prevalent and may manifest as gastropathy, cystopathy, and orthostatic hypotension. The extent of diabetic autonomic neuropathy is often underestimated.\n\nImpaired gastric emptying (gastroparesis) is an important consideration because of its significant implications for the posttransplant course. Patients with severe gastroparesis may have difficulty tolerating oral immunosuppressive medications that are essential to prevent rejection of the transplanted organs. Episodes of volume depletion with associated azotemia frequently occur in patients with SPK transplants. Gastrointestinal morbidity is a common indication for readmission following pancreas transplantation.\n\nNeurogenic bladder dysfunction is an important consideration in patients undergoing bladder-drained pancreas-alone transplantation or SPK transplantation. Inability to sense bladder fullness and empty the bladder predisposes to high postvoid residuals and the possibility of vesicoureteral reflux. This may affect renal allograft function adversely, increase the incidence of bladder infections and pyelonephritis, and predispose to graft pancreatitis.\n\nThe combination of orthostatic hypotension and recumbent hypertension results from dysregulation of vascular tone. This has implications for blood pressure control following transplantation, especially in patients with bladder-drained pancreas transplants who are predisposed to volume depletion. Therefore, careful reassessment of the posttransplantation antihypertensive medication requirement is important.\n [27] \n\nSensory and motor neuropathies\n\nThese conditions are common in patients with longstanding diabetes. This may have implications for rehabilitation after transplantation. Peripheral neuropathy is also an indicator for increased risk of injury to the feet and subsequent diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nMental or emotional illnesses\n\nMental illnesses, including neurosis and depression, are common in the insulin-dependent diabetic population. Diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these illnesses prior to obtaining a pancreas transplantation can significantly enhance medical compliance.\n\nOutcomes\nAssessment of pancreas graft outcome rates has been hampered by lack of uniformity in the criteria for graft failure. Some programs do not report a failed graft if C-peptide production continues, whereas others report a graft failure if the recipient is no longer insulin independent. The OPTN/UNOS Pancreas Transplantation Committee has proposed the following more precise definitions for pancreas graft failure, which are currently pending implementation\n [13, 33] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          Removal of the transplanted pancreas\n         \n\n\n\n          Re-registration for a pancreas transplant\n         \n\n\n\n          Registration for an islet transplant after receiving a pancreas transplant\n         \n\n\n\n          Insulin use of ≥0.5 units/kg/day for a consecutive 90 days\n         \n\n\n\n          Death of the recipient \n         \n\n\nThe number of recipients alive with a functioning pancreas allograft has contin­ued to rise over the past decade and exceeded 19,000 in 2019. Mortality has decreased consistently among all pancreas transplant groups as a result of safer and more effective immunosuppressive regimens. One-year mortality for PTA declined from 4.6% in 2012-2013 to 0.8% for transplants performed in 2014-2015. For SPK, the 5-year patient survival rates were similiar in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (90.5% and 91.5% respectively), despite the older age and comorbidity associated with type 2 diabetes. This is likely due to selection of candidates with type 2 diabetes whose cardiovascular status can tolerate the high operative risks.\n [2]  \n\nThe greatest risk of graft loss is within the first year post-transplant and in particular the first 3 months, regardless of type of pancreas transplant.  The International Pancreas Transplant Registry data analyses have used independence from insulin as the main criteria for graft survival. The best SPK transplant pancreas graft survival rates have been 86% at one year and 73% at 5 years. SPK outcomes are superior to those with PAK and PTA transplantation.  An advantage of SPK transplantation is that acute rejection can be detected more easily, because serum creatinine can be used as a marker.\n\nIn PAK transplantation, 1-year and 5-year pancreas graft survival rates are 80% and 58%, respectively. For PTA, the comparable rates are 77% and 56%.\n\nAcute rejection rates are similar for SPK and PAK at about 4% for each. The estimated half-life of grafts has improved over the years, with SPK lasting about 14 years, PAK 7 years, and PTA 7 years.\n [5, 19] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n",
        "Liver Transplantation": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nThe liver is the second most commonly transplanted major organ, after the kidney. In 2021, 9236 patients received a liver transplant and 12,800 patients were added to the waiting list for a liver transplant.\n [1] As of June 30, 2020, 98,989 liver transplant recipients were alive with a functioning graft.\n [2]  \nA liver transplant may involve the whole liver, a reduced liver, or a liver segment. Most transplants involve the whole organ, but segmental transplants are being performed with increasing frequency. Segmental transplantation allows two recipients to receive allografts from one cadaveric donor or allows for living-donor liver donation. Domino donation occurs when an individuals undergoes liver transplantation as treatment for a medical problem (eg, familial amyloidosis) but the liver is suitable for transplant to another candidate.\n\n\nThe vast majority (95%) of liver transplants are from deceased donors.\n [1] In 2020, 491 living-donor liver transplants were performed, compared with 8416 deceased-donor transplants; right lobe transplants accounted for 76.2%.\n [2] \nThe incidence of graft failure at 1 year is 7.9% for recipients of deceased-donor livers transplanted in 2019. For most adult living-donor liver recipients, the 5‐year survival rate was approximately 80%; however, for transplant recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the 5-year survival rate was 70.1%.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nWaitlist registrations and transplants for candidates with hepatitis C virus (HCV) have decreased sharply with the development of highly effective antiviral therapies and the declining prevalence of HCV infection in people aged 18‐50 years. In 2020, waitlist candidates with a primary diagnosis of HCV infection made up 12.0% of the waitlist, compared with 30.9% in 2010. In adults, the percentage of candidates with alcohol-associated liver disease rose from 22.2% in 2010 to 32.1% in 2020, making it the predominant indication for liver transplantation.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common etiology of chronic liver disease in developed countries and is on trajectory to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States.\n [3, 4] A dynamic Markov model predicts that the total NAFLD population will increase from an estimated 83.1 million cases (30.0% prevalence among people age 15 or older, 25.8% prevalence among all ages) in 2015 to 100.9 million cases (33.5% and 28.4%, respectively) by 2030. The prevalence of decompensated cirrhosis is predicted to increase by 180% (to 376,100 cases), resulting in an estimated increase of 59% in liver transplant cases (reaching 7,610 by 2030).\n [4] \n\nThe major constraint to meeting the demand for transplants is the availability of donated (cadaver) organs.\n [5]  Several steps have been taken, nationally and locally, to alleviate the organ shortage. National required-request laws mandate that families of every medically suitable potential donor be offered the option to donate organs and tissues. In addition, the National Organ Donation Collaborative efforts, currently ongoing, and laws that require all deaths to be reported to organ procurement organizations have resulted in increased organ donations. Rising public awareness about organ transplantation should continue to reduce the organ shortage.\n\nEffective antiviral drugs have made more HCV-positive organs available. As of 2016, HCV‐positive organs were no more frequently discarded than HCV‐negative organs (9.0% and 8.9%, respectively). In addition, the number of adults willing to accept transplants from HCV-positive donors  increased nearly three-fold from 2015 to 2020, from 21.0% to 60.2%.\n [2]  Aggressive usage of extended donors and reduced-size, split, and living-related liver transplantation continues to expand the organ donor pool, though these efforts still fail to meet the need for organs.\n\nIn terms of procurement and distribution, major improvements are being made nationally to optimize distribution and to ensure good matches. Criteria for inclusion on the waiting list are being standardized with the recent development of listing criteria for all degrees of sickness.\n\nThe United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) maintains a computerized registry of all patients waiting for organ transplants. All organs procured within a region are shared first within the region; if an appropriate recipient cannot be found within the region, UNOS personnel direct the organ to the recipient with the greatest need in another region. Organ recovery coordinators are on call 24 hours a day and arrange for serologic testing, removal, preservation, and distribution; additionally, they educate the public regarding organ donation.\n\nCOVID-19\nThe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) has issued consensus guidelines for liver transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Key recommendations include the following\n [6] :\n\n\n\n\n\n          All potential recipients with an acceptable organ offer should be screened for COVID-19 infection prior to arrival for transplantation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Test all donar and recipients for COVID -19 infection before transplantation.\n         \n\n\n\n          Patients with active COVID-19 infection should not undergo transplantation, except in cases of extreme need \n         \n\n\n\n          Repeat testing 14 or more days after diagnosis (or 21 days for those hospitalized for COVID-19 or immunocompromised individuals) is reasonable, and active transplantaton listing can be considered if repeat testing is negative and symptoms have resolved.\n         \n\n\n\n          COVID-19  vaccination should be strongly encouraged for all potential donors, recipients, and their close contacts prior to listing.\n         \n\n\n\n          The finding of incidental COVID-19 infection is not a contraindication to donation. Liver donation from potential donors with incidental findings of COVID-19 can be considered with recipient consent. \n         \n\n\n\n          Urgency of recipient need for transplantation may also be factored into the decision to accept an organ from a COVID-19 positive donor\n         \n\n\n\n          Donors dying because of COVID-19 should be evaluated as to organ quality\n         \n\n\nPatient education\nFor patient education information, see the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nInfections Center\n\n\n\n\nDigestive Disorders Center\n\n\n\n\nLiver Transplant\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis B\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis C\n\n\n\n\nCirrhosis.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Living Donor Hepatectomy": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe history of liver surgery stretches back to ancient times, when battle surgeons introduced debridement of damaged liver segments from open wounds. However, formal entry into the abdominal cavity to treat a liver tumor or to drain an abscess began with the advent of general anesthesia and antisepsis in the late 1800s.\nWith a better understanding of hepatic anatomy and the segmental structure of the liver, surgeons started performing partial liver resections. The first successful resection of a liver tumor was performed in 1887 in Germany by Langenbuch, the same surgeon who performed the first successful cholecystectomy 5 years earlier.\n\n\nThe lessons learned during World War II concerning liver trauma, blood supply to the liver, and bleeding control spurred the confidence of liver surgeons and marked the beginning of the modern era of liver operations.\n [1] Two landmarks of paramount importance have marked this period. The first was Cuinaud’s detailed description of the segmental anatomy of the liver based on blood supply (see image below).\n [2] The second, and probably brightest landmark of this period, was the first whole-liver transplantation by Thomas Starzl in 1963.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\nCouinaud's segmental liver anatomy. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs experience with liver resections increased dramatically while the supply of cadaveric liver grafts became increasingly inadequate to meet the needs for liver transplants, the concept of resecting a healthy person’s liver to use for support of another person’s life was raised.\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) emerged originally for pediatric patients because of the high mortality rate among children awaiting a cadaveric graft\n [4] and the fact that a child needs only a small allograft, so an adult donor would not need to undergo major hepatectomy.\n [5] \n\nRaia et al from Brazil described the first attempt of LDLT a child, in 1989.\n [6] Although the recipient did not survive, other centers followed, and the first successful pediatric LDLT, from a mother to her son, was performed by Strong in Australia that same year.\n [7] \n\nIn the United States, the first successful LDLT from a parent to a child was performed the same year at the University of Chicago.\n [8] Before this first procedure, the physicians involved published a manuscript describing the protocol for donor and recipient selection, risks and benefits, and the use of the donor advocacy panel.\n [9] A few years later, reports first showed that the introduction of LDLT dramatically decreased the mortality of children on the waiting list.\n [10] \n\nWith the success of the LDLT in the pediatric population, transplant centers started to embrace the idea of using LDLT in adult recipients. The first successful cases were reported in Japan, where cadaveric grafts are extremely scarce owing to cultural constrains to organ donation.\n [11]  Japanese transplant teams reported excellent results with the use of left- and right-lobe grafts.\n [12] \n\nThe initial results from the LDLT experience in the United States were not as encouraging,\n [13] so the first decade of adult-to-adult LDLT developed very slowly, with only 34 such procedures performed between 1991 and 1998.\n [8] Many of the failures resulted from the underappreciated importance of donor graft size to recipient size. In the pediatric population, this issue was absent, since the size of the recipient was always much smaller than that of the donor. In adult patients, the graft was often too small, the posttransplant function was poor, and, in some cases, there was primary nonfunction.\n [14, 15] \n\nAfter surgeons realized this concept and avoided smaller grafts for larger recipients, the success of adult-to-adult LDLT increased, along with the number of such transplantations performed. Thus, from 1988-2021, 8370 LDLT were performed in the United States.\n [16] Enthusiasm for adult-to-adult LDLT in the United States peaked in 2000, with 49 centers performing this operation. However, the enthusiasm fell sharply after a donor death in 2001, which changed the climate for living donation.\n [17]  \n\nThe donor death resulted in numerous position papers, conferences, and review boards.\n [18] New York State created a review committee and document that mandated guidelines for transplant centers and physicians performing LDLT.\n [19, 20] Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a multicenter prospective study of adult-to-adult LDLT, which includes 9 centers in the United States. The Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL) has published outcomes and suggestions concerning LDLT in adult patients,\n [21, 22] \n\nFrom 2001-2006, the number of centers performing adult LDLT decreased, and the number of operations performed declined and then stabilized at around 250 cases per year, or 5% of the total number of liver transplantations in adults, approximately half of the peak in 2001.\n [19]  However, since 2015, these numbers have been steadily, increasing reaching a record 563 LDLT performed in 2021.\n [16] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Lung Transplantation": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nLung transplantation is an accepted modality of treatment for advanced stage lung disease. Since 1988, over 46,000 lung transplants and over 1400 heart/lung transplantations have been performed in the Unites States, representing approximately 5% of all organ transplants.\n [1]  \nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in the United States concluded that \"lung transplantation has evolved as a clinical procedure achieving a favorable risk-benefit ratio and acceptable 1- and 2-year survival rates.\"\n [2] The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation continues to monitor lung transplantation and has an ongoing registry, which is reported annually.\n [3] \n\n\nHighly sophisticated and extraordinary therapies, such as lung transplantation, are performed at a great cost to society. Presently, active research is being conducted on enhancing the patient's quality of life following lung transplantation. Several studies have reported a significant improvement in different quality-of-life domains, tested pretransplant and posttransplant. Other studies comparing candidates and lung transplant recipients have demonstrated significant improvements in energy levels, physical functioning, mobility, and symptoms such as dyspnea and anxiety. The recipients have expressed greater satisfaction with their lives and their health following lung transplantation.\nAttempts to compute the costs of lung transplantation to general society and to determine the cost effectiveness of this therapy have been made. Cost evaluations should take into account both the actual cost and the improved quality of life provided by this therapy compared to standard care. The cost is expressed in units of QALY (quality-adjusted life-year), which reflects the real or anticipated survival time and health-related quality of life.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1995, the University of Washington Medical Center estimated that lung transplantation costs $176,817 per QALY compared with traditional therapy.\n [4]  A study of 3000 Medicare patients who received lung transplantations between 2005-2011 found that the average cost of lung transplantation was $135,622. However, high-volume transplant centers (35 or more lung transplantations annually) had a mean transplantation cost of $131,352. In addition, median length of stay in the intensive care unit fell significantly with increasing lung transplantation volume, from 14 days in low-volume centers to 11 days in intermediate centers and 10 days in high-volume centers.\n [5] \n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, after adjusting for recipient health risk, low-volume centers had an 11.66% greater transplant admission cost (P = 0.040), a 41% greater risk for in-hospital mortality (P = 0.015), and a 14% greater risk for early hospital readmission (P = 0.033) compared with high-volume centers. There was no significant difference in transplant cost, in-hospital mortality, or early hospital readmission between intermediate- and high-volume centers.\n [5] \n\nLiving donor transplantation\nTransplantation of lobes from living donors involves bilateral implantation of the lower lobes from two blood group–compatible living donors. Donation of a lobe decreases the donor's lung volume by an average of approximately 15% and, consequently, is not associated with long-term functional limitation.\n\nLiving-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT) has been used as an option for patients who are considered too ill to await cadaveric transplantation.\n [6] The procedure was initially performed in patients with cystic fibrosis, although the indications were subsequently broadened. The functional and survival outcomes with LDLLT are similar to those achieved with conventional transplantation of cadaveric lungs. \n\nThere have been a total of 253 LDLLT in the United States since 1990; however, no LDLLT has been performed in the US since 2013.\n [1]  \n\nDespite fairly extensive experience, no donor mortality has been reported. In a study of 369 live lung donors serious complications occurred in 18% of donors; 2.2% underwent reoperation and 6.5% had an early rehospitalization. No deaths occurred and no donors underwent lung transplantation during 4000+ person-years of follow-up (death: minimum 4, maximum 17 years; transplant: minimum 5, maximum 19). Live lung donation remains a potential option for recipients when using deceased donor lungs lacks feasibility. However, in the United States the use of two live donors for each recipient and the risk of morbidity associated with live lung donation do not justify this approach when deceased lung donors remain available.\n [7] \n\nIn recent years, most of the reports on LDLLT have been from Japan, where the average waiting time for a cadaveric lung is exceeding 800 days. LDLLT has been performed both for adult and pediatric patients suffering from various end-stage lung diseases including restrictive, obstructive, vascular, and infectious conditions.\n [8] \n\nCompared with bilateral cadaveric lung transplants, long-term studies have shown that the relatively smaller-sized lobes can provide similar pulmonary function and exercise capacity. Living lobar lung transplantation should be considered in a patient with a clinically deteriorating condition. Although no deaths have been reported in the donor cohort, a risk of death between 0.5% and 1% should be quoted, pending further data. A case series of 128 living lobar lung transplantations performed in 123 patients between 1993 and 2003 was published.\n [9]  The actuarial survival among the living lobar recipients was 70%, 54%, and 45%, at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.\n [9] \n\nFor patient education information, see Lung Disease and Respiratory Health Center, as well as Heart and Lung Transplant and Bronchoscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pancreas Transplantation": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nPancreas transplantation is principally performed to ameliorate type 1 diabetes mellitus and produce complete independence from injected insulin. In addition, pancreas transplantation in patients with type 2 diabetes has increased steadily in recent years.\n [1] The pancreas is usually procured from a deceased organ donor, although select cases of living-donor pancreas transplantations have been performed. \nThe number of pancreas transplants in the United States decreased from 2004 (when approximately 1500 were performed) to 2015. Subsequently, pancreas transplants have risen, mainly because of increased simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplants, while pancreas transplant alone (PTA) continued on a downward trend.\n [1] In 2020, 135 PTAs were performed in the US, compared with 827 SPK transplantations. In the US, SPK transplantations are the most common multi-organ transplant; over 26,000 SPK transplantations were performed from 1988 through 2021.\n [1, 2] See the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation with enteric drainage.

PAK represented less than 10% of pancreas transplants in 2019.\n [1] The remaining cases are performed as PTA in nonuremic patients with labile and problematic diabetes.  \n\n\n\n\nAn alternative therapy that may also ameliorate diabetes is islet cell transplantation. Pancreas and islet cell transplantation can be considered complementary transplant options and undergoing one or the other is not mutually exclusive. In an analysis of 40 pancreas transplantations (50% PTA, 27.5% SPK, 22.5% PAK) after islet cell transplantation graft failure, overall survival rates (97% at 1 year and 83% at 5 years) were not adversely affected.\n [3] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Pediatric Heart Transplantation": "\nBackground\n\n\nHuman orthotopic heart transplantation began on December 3, 1967 when Drs. Chistiaan and Marius Barnard transplanted the heart of a 15-year-old trauma victim into a 55-year-old recipient in Capetown, South Africa.\n [4] Three days later, on December 6, 1967, Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz performed the first orthotopic heart transplantation in a neonate in New York.\n [5] The infant died of a cardiac arrest 6.5 hours after receiving the transplant.\n\nThe transplantation of infants would cease for 16 years before being attempted again.\n [6] Over those 16 years, adult heart transplantation became routine and the lower age limit of recipients declined. By 1984, the medical field was again ready for infant transplantation. For the next 10 years, orthotopic heart transplantation became an option for primary therapy in neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\n [7]  A shift toward palliation of complex congenital heart disease took place at this time, due to the limited number of infant donors.\n\nAt the same time, cardiac xenotransplantation in animal models was improving. On October 26, 1984, the first human cardiac xenotransplant took place, performed by Dr. Leonard L. Bailey at Loma Linda University in California.\n [8] A baboon heart was transplanted into a 12-day old neonate with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. She died after 20 days.

        "Replantation in Emergency Medicine": "\nPractice Essentials\n\n\nReplantation aims to restore the amputated part to its anatomical site, preserving function and appearance. Outcome depends on factors intrinsic to the patient and to the nature of the injury. Young patients who have distal, cleanly amputated extremities have the best return of function; multiple levels of injury, crush, or avulsing injuries have less. Patients must be fully informed about the commitment to rehabilitation and the possibility of multiple surgeries for best results.\nAs replantation techniques advance, and success rates increase regardless of adverse factors, the focus is shifting from merely achieving anatomic survival through adequate tissue perfusion, to reconstruction of a functional limb. In some instances, a hand with a well-formed stump may be more functional than one with a functionless digit. The goal of replantation should not be the indiscriminate replantation of all severed fingers but the preservation of quality of life through regained function and appearance. This being said, most experts believe thumbs should be reattached regardless of mechanism of injury due to their representation of almost half of hand function.\n\n\nFor additional information, see Hand Amputations and Replantation, Digital Amputations, and Thumb Reconstruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n"

        "Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) Measurement": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a noninvasive, simple, reproducible, and cost-effective diagnostic test that compares blood pressures in the upper and lower limbs to determine the presence of resistance to blood flow in the lower extremities, typically caused by narrowing of the arterial lumen resulting from atherosclerosis.\n [1, 2, 3] The simplicity and low cost of ABI measurement make it a convenient diagnostic test for early detection of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or acute arterial injury.\nIn patients with clinically suspected significant PAD, an ABI lower than 0.90 has been reported to have a sensitivity of 79-95% and a specificity exceeding 95%.\n [4, 5, 6] In diabetic patients with neuropathy or ulcers, however, the accuracy of the ABI in early detection of PAD is much more variable, with a sensitivity of 29-100% and a specificity of 58-97% as compared with imaging methods (angiography or color duplex ultrasonography [CDUS]).\n [7] Thus, in diabetics with signs of neuropathy or foot ulcers, a normal ABI result should be interpreted with caution, and further testing may be warranted in order to institute guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT).\n [8] \n\n\nGDMT for PAD includes interventions to alleviate symptoms from PAD (claudication), to prevent progression to critical limb ischemia (CLI), and to avert major acute cardiovascular events (MACEs); the presence of PAD is a well-established risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD).\nIn the acute trauma setting, the ABI can facilitate identification and risk stratification for those at risk for lower-extremity arterial injury.\n [9, 10, 11] In the setting of potential arterial injury after acute blunt or penetrating injury to the lower extremity in stable patients, an ABI lower than 0.90 has been shown to have a sensitivity exceeding 87% and a specificity exceeding 97% for identifying lower-extremity arterial injury.\n [10] Furthermore, the ABI can aid in the assessment of postoperative wound healing and ulcer management.\n [12] \n\n\n\n\nFurther information on the use of the ABI is available in the PAD management guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) and in a prior scientific statement from the same organization.\n [8, 13] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Although unilateral reconstruction of the iliac vessels used to be common, aortobifemoral bypass is currently preferred. The contralateral disease usually progresses, and a bilateral femoral bypass eliminates future revision of a unilateral bypass.\n [3, 4, 5] \n\n\n\n\nThe aortic bifemoral bypass is considered to be the most durable of all bypasses for the peripheral system. It is an ideal procedure for patients with aortoiliac disease, aortic aneurysms extending into the iliac arteries, or aortic atherosclerosis.\n [6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Arterial Blood Gas Sampling": "\nBackground\n\n\nArteries are the large vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. The distribution of the systemic arteries is like a ramified tree, the common trunk of which, formed by the aorta, commences at the left ventricle, while the smallest ramifications extend to the peripheral parts of the body and the contained organs. For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Arterial Supply Anatomy.\nArterial blood gas (ABG) sampling by direct vascular puncture is a procedure often practiced in the hospital setting. The relatively low incidence of major complications,\n [1] its ability to be performed at the patient’s bedside, and its rapid analysis make it an important tool used by physicians to direct and redirect the treatment of their patients, especially in patients who are critically ill, to determine gas exchange levels in the blood related to respiratory, metabolic, and renal function.\n\n\nABG sampling provides valuable information on the acid-base balance at a specific point in the course of a patient's illness. It is the only reliable determination of ventilation success as evidenced by CO2 content. It constitutes a more precise measure of successful gas exchange and oxygenation. ABG sampling is the only way of accurately determining the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (see the A-a Gradient calculator).\nBecause the results of ABG sampling only reflect the physiologic state of the patient at the time of the sampling, it is important that they be carefully correlated with the evolving clinical scenario and with any changes in the patient’s treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

More than 7 million such procedures are performed worldwide every year.\nDespite the growing popularity of radial access, the vast majority of these procedures are still performed through the common femoral artery in the groin.\n [1] \n\n\nManual compression was once traditionally used to close the common femoral artery at the conclusion of the procedure. This method required that the patient avoid ambulation for at least 6 hours. Because of the increasing sophistication of the anticoagulant agents used in percutaneous interventions, prompt and successful hemostasis without complications became necessary.\nVascular closure devices (VCDs) were developed as a solution to this problem.\n [2] Percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) such as Impella\n [3] and the percutaneous aortic/mitral valve replacement procedures require large access sites. Manual compression is not an ideal option in these situations, and an appropriate closure device can obviate the need for surgical closure of the access site.\n\n\n\n\nThe use of closure devices is bound to increase, both because of increasing awareness and comfort levels among operators and because of improvements made to the devices themselves.\n\n\n\n\nMany devices on the market are designed to achieve access closure and hemostasis.\n [4] This article focuses on two commonly used arterial active closure devices: Angio-Seal (a collagen plug–based device) and Perclose ProGlide (a suture-based device).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Intra-arterial blood pressure (BP) measurement is more accurate than measurement of BP by noninvasive means, especially in the critically ill.\n [1] Intra-arterial BP management allows rapid recognition of BP changes, which is especially vital for patients receiving continuous infusions of vasoactive drugs. Arterial cannulation allows repeated arterial blood gas samples to be drawn.\nArterial line placement is a safe procedure. Major complications occur in fewer than 1% of placements.\n [2]  Risks can be minimized with appropriate knowledge of the anatomy and procedural skills. Arterial lines can be placed in the radial, ulnar, brachial, axillary, posterior tibial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis arteries.\n\n\nIn both adults and children, the most common site of cannulation is the radial artery.\n [2, 3, 4] The superficial and consistent anatomic location of the radial artery affords easier access, facilitates care, and yields fewer complications.\n [4]  \nThe femoral artery is the second most common site for arterial cannulation. One advantage of femoral artery cannulation is that the vessel is larger than the radial artery and has stronger pulsation. Additional advantages include decreased risks of thrombosis and of accidental catheter dislodgment.\n [5]  \n\n\n\n\nThere has been debate over whether radial or femoral arterial line placement more accurately measures BP and mean arterial pressure (MAP); however, both sites provide reliable data.\n [6, 7, 8]  The arterial cannulation site is patient-specific and is determined on the basis of the anatomy, the risks and benefits, and the indication for the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Because the upper-body approaches are generally deemed to be cleaner than femoral approaches (ie, upper-body sites are less likely to be contaminated), cardiologists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists alike have long favored them. The axillary, cephalic, and subclavian veins, as well the internal and external jugular veins, have all been used to gain central access for placement of pacemaker or defibrillator leads or central venous lines.\nThis article reviews the techniques for gaining access to the axillary venous system for the purposes of lead placement as well as adapting those techniques for central venous line placement. To learn about other techniques for central venous line placement, see Central Venous Access via Subclavian Approach to Subclavian Vein and Central Venous Access via Supraclavicular Approach to Subclavian Vein.\n\n\nThe axillary vein has become the favored conduit for the placement of pacing and defibrillation leads for several reasons.\n [1] Unlike the cephalic and external jugular veins, the axillary vein is almost always large enough to accommodate multiple pacing leads. In comparison with the subclavian vein, the properly accessed axillary vein affords a less acute course. This potentially decreases mechanical stress on the implanted leads or catheters and, hence, results in a lower incidence of mechanical lead failure or catheter occlusion.\n [2] Compelling evidence has implicated the infraclavicular musculotendinous complex in mechanical lead failure and occlusion of subclavian catheters.\n [3, 4] \nAdditionally, subclavian access comes with the risk of inadvertently accessing the noncompressible subclavian artery and the potential for increased mechanical stress on the lead or indwelling catheter from crossing the subclavius muscle and the clavipectoral fascia. Finally, use of the axillary system, unlike use of the jugular system, does not require tunneling of the leads over or under the clavicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

This extra-anatomic reconstructive method is one of the options for managing patients presenting with infected aortic grafts or aortoenteric fistulae.\n [2, 3, 4] \nBypass patency rates have been estimated to be in the range of 40-80% at 5 years.\n [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  A study by Samson et al cited a slightly higher figure of 83.7% overall (85.5% for unilateral bypass, 81.8% for bilateral bypass).\n [10] Patency rates are influenced by the characteristics of the patients; claudicants generally have better patency than patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI).

Its advantages include consistent landmarks, increased patient comfort, and lower potential for infection or arterial injury compared with other sites of access.\n\n\n\n\nThe advent of bedside ultrasonography (US) has changed the overall technique of the placement of central venous catheters in both the internal jugular vein and the femoral vein. However, the use of this modality for subclavian routes has been infrequently studied, though there are some reports suggesting that it is feasible and safe.\n\nBecause of the anatomy of the subclavian approach, there is little room to effectively position the transducer while manipulating the needle. With the advent of newer transducers, however, reports are emerging of effective US-guided techniques.\n [9]  Compared with the studies evaluating the internal jugular approach, the studies evaluating US-guided approaches to the subclavian vein have been fewer in number and lower in quality; nevertheless, their results have been encouraging with respect to patient safety and quality.\n [10, 11, 12] \n\nThe physician’s experience and comfort level with the procedure, however, are the main determinants as to the success of the line placement in cases with no other patient-related factors that may increase the incidence of complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Central Venous Access via Posterior Approach to Internal Jugular Vein": "\nBackground\n\n\nIn caring for patients who are critically ill, access to the central venous circulation is important. Central venous access allows the placement of various types of intravenous (IV) lines to facilitate the infusion of fluids, blood products, and drugs and to obtain blood for laboratory analysis. It is also an essential procedure in patients in whom placement of a line in a peripheral vein is impossible. A central line may be the only means of venous access in such cases.\nSubclavian and internal jugular lines can allow the measurement of central venous pressure (CVP), an important parameter for gauging whether a patient has been given an adequate amount of fluids.\n\n\nThree central veins are typically used for venous access:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Internal jugular vein (IJV)\n         \n\n\n\nSubclavian vein\n\n\n\n\nFemoral vein\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe capacity to place a line in the IJV is an important skill; this is the preferred vein for placement of a transvenous pacemaker because it is a straight line down the vein to the right side of the heart.\n [1]  Given that it can be compressed, the IJV can be used for central venous access in patients who have impaired blood clotting. However, in such patients, the femoral vein is most often used.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three traditional approaches to the IJV:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnterior\n\n\n\n\n          Posterior\n         \n\n\n\n          Central\n         \n\n\nThe central and posterior approaches are most commonly used and are less likely to result in puncture of the carotid artery.

It offers several advantages over the infraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein.\n [9] At the insertion site, the subclavian vein is closer to the skin, and the right-side approach offers a straighter path into the subclavian vein. In addition, this site is often more accessible during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and during active surgical cases. Finally, in patients who are obese, this anatomic area is less distorted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Central Venous Access via Tunneled Anterior Approach to Internal Jugular Vein": "\nBackground\n\n\nCentral venous access is essential in providing quality medical care to many patients for whom intensive therapy is required. In many situations, a semipermanent tunneled central line is preferred (see Indications). An anterior approach to the internal jugular vein (IJV) is the best option in this situation because it offers the easiest route with a low risk of complications.\nIn this procedure, a tunneled catheter is surgically inserted into a vein in the neck or chest and passed under the skin. Only the end of the catheter is brought through the skin. Medicines and intravenous (IV) fluid can be administered through this catheter; other tasks, such as blood sampling, can also be performed. Passing the catheter under the skin helps secure the catheter, reduces the rate of infection, and permits free movement of the catheter port. Placement of a tunneled catheter should be carried out by practitioners with specific experience in the procedure.\n\n\nCompared with femoral site access, IJV or subclavian vein access was associated with a lower risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in some studies; however, subsequent studies found no significant differences in CRBSI rates between these three sites.\n [1]  Overall, the IJV is a more suitable site, especially in children, though other factors (eg, interindividual variations in vein size) must be kept in mind.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Esophagogastric Devascularization": "\nBackground\n\n\nEsophagogastric devascularization procedures are performed to control bleeding from varices in the esophagogastric region. They are not intended as treatment of the underlying disease, and they do not control bleeding from ectopic varices. Splenectomy is commonly performed as part of esophagogastric devascualrization.\nPortal hypertension (PH), defined as portal pressure greater than 5 mm Hg, is a main consequence of cirrhosis. Clinically significant PH typically involves a portal pressure of 10 mm Hg or higher and is associated with an increased risk that gastroesophageal varices (GEVs) will develop. GEVs are found in approximately 50% of cirrhotic patients and contribute to the elevated morbidity and mortality among patients with PH. The reported 6-week mortality following each episode of variceal bleeding is in the range of 15-20%.\n [1, 2] \n\n\nNonoperative therapies are the mainstay of treatment for acute and prophylactic variceal hemorrhage (VH). These therapies include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Medications - Beta blockers, vasopressin and its analogues, somatostatin and its analogues\n         \n\n\n\n          Endoscopic procedures - Endoscopic variceal ligation, sclerotherapy, glue injection\n         \n\n\n\n          Interventional radiologic procedures - Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), \n          transjugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgical management of VH includes shunting and nonshunting operations. Nonshunting operations include esophagogastric devascularization, esophageal transection, and splenectomy.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\nIn PH, there is abnormal upward and increased flow through the portal system, creating large dilated venous varices. Specifically, serial section of the venous drainage of the esophagus in PH has shown that large vessels in the lamina propria communicate directly with engorged intraepithelial channels via epithelial papillae. Ideally, esophagogastric devascularization procedures control bleeding varices by permanently obliterating the vessels in the lower periesophageal vessels and dilated intraepithelial vessels.\n\nThe idea of transthoracic ligation of esophageal varices was first proposed by Crile (1950), with many modifications of the procedure following its initial conception. Boerema (1949) and Vosschulte (1957) used the button technique for transabdominal esophageal transection; however, this procedure was associated with major stricture formation. Walker (1964) and Tanner (1961) proposed a vertical incision of the muscle layers of esophagus, with transverse division of mucosa and submucosa and subcardiac portoazygos disconnection with gastric transection, respectively.\n\nIn 1967, Hassab introduced a method of gastroesophageal decongestion and splenectomy (GEDS) for management of bleeding varices secondary to schistosomiasis, which yielded a remarkably low rate of rebleeding. In 1973, Sugiura and Futagawa formulated the Sugiura procedure, which included extensive transthoracic paraesophageal devascularization, esophageal transection combined with an abdominal component consisting of splenectomy, devascularization of the upper stomach, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty.\n [3]  \n\nSeveral modifications of the Hassab and Sugiura procedures were subsequently developed. Vankemmel (1974) was the first to report the use of a circular stapling gun for esophageal transection. Inokuchi (1985) modified the Sugiura procedure with a singular abdominal approach. Hashizume et al (1998) were the first to use a laparoscopic technique to perform the Hassab procedure and splenectomy. Johnson et al (2006) proposed a transabdominal modified devascularization procedure without esophageal stapler transection.\n [3, 4]  \n\nBoth procedures continue to be modified in subtle ways by a multitude of surgeons.\n [5, 6]  The goal of all of these procedures is to treat variceal bleeding while maintaining portal perfusion and long-term hepatic and systemic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis, thereby reducing the incidence of postoperative encephalopathy. The specific approach chosen should be based on the experience and comfort level of the operating surgeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

It has been validated in randomized and nonrandomized prospective studies as a safe and effective surgical treatment for carotid stenosis. The efficacy of surgical treatment of atherosclerotic carotid stenosis in the prevention of stroke is well documented.\nWorldwide, stroke is a leading cause of mortality; cerebrovascular disease accounted for approximately 7 million deaths in 2020.\n [1]  In the United States, the annual incidences of stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are approximately 795,000 and 300,000 cases, respectively, and stroke was responsible for approximately 150,000 US deaths in 2019.\n [1] \n\n\nStroke is an important cause of long-term disability.\n [2]  Only 29% of patients with nonfatal stroke recover with normal neurologic function.\n [3] In the Framingham study, which prospectively followed 5184 men and women from the general population for 26 years, Sacco et al reported a very high incidence of recurrent cerebrovascular infarctions (9% per year) in patients who survived an initial stroke. In the same study, the cumulative 5-year recurrent stroke rate was 42% for men and 24% for women.\n [4] \nIn addition to high rates of death, recurrence, and long-term disability, management of stroke imposes a substantial economic burden on society.

Therefore, the ability to gain rapid and accurate vascular access has become a skill that it is imperative for critical and emergency care physicians to possess.\n [1] \nPeripheral veins can be used to gain access to the central venous system.\n [2] However, this requires the placement of long catheters via superficial veins that may be difficult to locate in emergency situations. The predictable anatomic locations of the internal jugular, subclavian, and femoral veins make them easy to cannulate in patients who are critically ill.\n\n\nAll routes of central venous access are associated with complications and possible failure. The less than ideal conditions under which such access is established also contribute to the incidence of complications. Compared with femoral site access, internal jugular or subclavian access was associated with a lower risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in earlier studies; however, subsequent studies (2008-2010) indicated that there were no differences among these three sites with regard to the rate of CRBSIs.\n [3] \nOne of the most common methods for gaining central venous access in emergency situations is via femoral vein cannulation.

The technique is dependent upon a patent iliac arterial system without hemodynamically significant disease to supply adequate inflow of blood to both lower extremities. It is a commonly used means of extra-anatomic vascular reconstruction for patients with disabling claudication or critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) in whom underlying anatomic constraints rule out endovascular means of restoring in-line flow and those who do not qualify for anatomic reconstruction because of comorbidities that preclude a more invasive open approach.\nFemorofemoral bypass may also be used as a component of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs),\n [1] whereupon one aortoiliac system is occluded on an emergency or elective basis to ensure exclusion of the aortic aneurysm. Primary patency rates of femorofemoral bypasses are estimated to be in the range of 65-70% at 5 years.\n [2, 3, 4]  The bypass patency rates, however, are inferior to in-line reconstruction benchmarks set by the aortofemoral and iliofemoral bypass operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Thermal ablation currently competes successfully with foam for treatment of saphenous veins in the United States, and ambulatory phlebectomy competes with foam for treatment of tributary veins and localized varicosities, especially when these are large.\nSclerotherapy is the chemical ablation of abnormal veins. The modern goal of therapy is irreversible fibrotic occlusion, followed by reabsorption of the target vessel. Absence of endothelium and subendothelial edema are seen within 2 minutes of foam injection. At 15 minutes, necrosis of the vein wall into the tunica media is seen.\n [1] \n\n\nSclerotherapy is an old technique that was revolutionized by technologic advances.\n [2, 3] Foaming detergent sclerosants offered increased potency and could be visualized by means of ultrasonography (US). US guidance allowed better anatomic visualization, greater hemodynamic understanding, more precise foam targeting and delivery, and monitoring for unwanted foam passage into deep veins.\n [4, 5] With these advances, sclerotherapy became a competitive treatment for any type or size of vein.\nSclerotherapy’s development has been limited somewhat by the wide range of techniques available. This practice variation has yielded varying results and has made generalizing about the procedure more difficult. The differences between techniques have now begun to be tested, however, and the resulting knowledge has improved overall results.

Arterial supply (inflow) sites therefore include the common femoral, deep femoral (profunda femoris), superficial femoral, and popliteal arteries. Occasionally, a tibial artery may become the inflow vessel.\nThe primary indication for infrapopliteal bypass is critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This method of surgical arterial reconstruction can be applied to patients with nonatherosclerotic conditions such as aneurysmal disease and traumatic arterial injuries. The bypass conduit should usually be composed of autogenous vein, but prosthetic material can be used in the absence of suitable autogenous conduit.\n [1] \n\n\nWith regard to conduit type, vein grafts are superior to all prosthetic conduits for infrapopliteal bypass, regardless of target vessel.\n [2, 3, 4] The great saphenous vein (GSV; also referred to as the long or greater saphenous vein) is the most commonly utilized autogenous conduit; however, the small saphenous vein (SSV; also referred to as the short or lesser saphenous vein), the superficial femoral vein,\n [5] and spliced vein grafts from the arm can also be used.\n [6, 7] \nNumerous varieties of prosthetic conduits are available; options include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Dacron\n         \n\n\n\n          Heparin-bonded Dacron\n         \n\n\n\n          Human umbilical vein\n         \n\n\n\n          Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)\n         \n\n\n\n          Heparin-bonded PTFE\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf these, PTFE is the most commonly used material.

With the development of intravenous (IV) catheters, this method was abandoned until the 1980s, when intraosseous access was reintroduced, particularly for rapid fluid infusion during resuscitation.\n [2] \nOn the basis of previous guidelines, intraosseous access was suggested for children aged 6 years or younger,\n [3]  though subsequent studies showed that it is safe in older children and adults.\n [4, 5, 6, 7]  Successful infusions in newborns further suggested that access via the intraosseous route is faster than access via umbilical veins.\n [8, 9] \n\n\nThe Emergency Cardiovascular Care Guidelines of 2000 recommended intraosseous access in all children after two failed attempts at IV access or during circulatory collapse. In 2010, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended intraosseous access if IV access cannot be quickly and reliably established.\n [10]  This position was largely retained in subsequent updates to the AHA guidelines.\n [11, 12, 13] \nIntraosseous access may be easily established by users with little training and is more rapidly achieved than IV access.\n [14]  Manual insertion with force had previously been the primary method for intraosseous insertion, but automated intraosseous insertion devices such as the Arrow EZ-IO (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC)\n [15]  have been growing in popularity.\n [16]  Studies suggested that these automated devices are safe and highly successful on first attempts in both children and adults.\n [17, 18, 19, 20] \n\n\n\n\nSeveral articles have described the use of intraosseous access in military and rescue scenarios, where rapid access may be crucial, peripheral venous access may be hard to obtain, and first responders may have limited experience or technical capacity.\n [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] \n\n\n\n\nBlood obtained through intraosseous access may be used to obtain most laboratory values, including pH level, carbon dioxide tension (PCO2), and ABO and Rh typing.\n [26]  The results of these standard laboratory tests may differ slightly from results obtained with venous blood samples because of low flow and stasis in the bone marrow. More study is needed on the comparability of values from intraosseous samples and those from arterial or venous samples.\n [27] \n\nAll medications and blood products can be safely administered through the intraosseous line, and the onset of action and peak drug levels are comparable to those of IV administration.\n\nIntraosseous access has also been employed for injection of contrast media in computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA).\n [28] \n\nIntraosseous needles left in the marrow for longer than 72 hours are at a higher risk of local infection; thus, needles should be removed as soon as permanent venous access is established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Intravenous Cannulation": "\nBackground\n\n\nIntravenous (IV) cannulation is a technique in which a cannula is placed inside a vein to provide venous access. Venous access allows sampling of blood, as well as administration of fluids, medications, parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, and blood products.\n [1] \nVeins have a three-layered wall composed of an internal endothelium surrounded by a thin layer of muscle fibers that is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue. Venous valves encourage unidirectional flow of blood and prevent pooling of blood in the dependent portions of the extremities; they also can impede the passage of a catheter through and into a vein. Venous valves are more numerous just distal to the points where tributaries join larger veins and in the lower extremities.\n [2] \n\n\nThis topic describes placement of an over-the-needle IV catheter, in which the catheter is mounted on the needle (see the first image below). Such devices are available in various gauges (16-24 gauge), lengths (25-44 mm), compositions, and designs (see the second image below).\n\n\n\n\n\nOver-the-needle IV catheter. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious sizes of over-the-needle IV catheters. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, it is advisable to select the smallest gauge of catheter that can still be effectively used to deliver the prescribed therapy; this will minimize the risk of damage to the vessel intima and ensure adequate blood flow around the catheter, which reduces the risk of phlebitis.\n [3]  However, if the situation is an emergency or if the patient is expected to require large volumes infused over a short period of time, the largest-gauge and shortest catheter that is likely to fit the chosen vein should be used.\n\nVeins with high internal pressure become engorged and are easier to access. The use of venous tourniquets, dependent positioning, “pumping” via muscle contraction, and the local application of heat or nitroglycerin ointment can contribute to venous engorgement.\n [2] \n\nThe superficial veins of the upper extremities are preferred to those of the lower extremities for peripheral venous access because cannulation of upper-extremity veins interferes less with patient mobility and poses a lower risk for phlebitis.\n [4]  It is easier to insert a venous catheter where two tributaries merge into a Y-shaped form. It is recommended to choose a straight portion of a vein to minimize the chance of hitting valves.\n\nThis article describes the placement of an IV catheter in an upper extremity.

That is, most devices use the apex of the left ventricle (LV) as the inflow site to the pump, which subsequently gives off an outflow graft to the aorta, thus bypassing the ailing LV.\nThis article describes some of the issues related to implantation of LVADs. Although many types of devices are currently available, they do not differ significantly with regard to general implantation technique.

        "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)": "\nBackground\n\n\nSince the first human percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure was performed in 1977, the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased dramatically; it is now one of the most commonly performed medical interventions. Originally developed in Switzerland by Andreas Gruentzig, PCI has transformed the practice of revascularization for coronary artery disease (CAD).\n\nCoronary angioplasty, initially used in the treatment of patients with stable angina and discrete lesions in a single coronary artery, currently has multiple indications, including unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and multivessel CAD. With the combination of sophisticated equipment, experienced operators, and modern drug therapy, PCI has evolved into an effective nonsurgical modality for treating patients with CAD. Ongoing technical advances are allowing more patients with chronic total occlusions (CTOs) to be successfully treated percutaneously.\n\nImprovements in catheter technique and the development of new devices and medications have paralleled our growing understanding of cardiovascular physiology, the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the response to vascular injury. Intracoronary stents and atherectomy devices have been developed to increase the success and decrease the complications of conventional balloon dilation, as well as to expand the indications for revascularization. Interventionalists now can safely treat more complex coronary lesions and restenosis.\n\nThe development of drug-eluting stents (DESs) has substantially reduced the problem of restenosis seen with bare-metal stents (BMSs). At the same time, advances in intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fractional flow reserve (FFR) evaluation have improved the understanding of coronary plaque morphology, plaque vulnerability, and coronary physiology.\n\nFurthermore, many of these technologies are able to help identify patients who will benefit most from PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or medical therapy. Adjunctive pharmacologic therapies aimed at preventing acute reocclusion have also improved the safety and efficacy of PCI.\n\nThe growth of PCI has been remarkable. Stents are now used in more than 80% of PCI cases in the United States. This prominent use of stents will be sustained they result in improved outcomes. Over the past two decades, innovations in PCI have been paralleled by dramatic reductions in 30-day death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target-vessel revascularization rates.

After applying a venous tourniquet, the physician should inspect and palpate potential sites, starting with the nondominant extremity. On palpation, the vein should be soft and bouncy, it should refill after being depressed, and it ideally should be well supported by the surrounding tissue.\n\n\nPhlebotomy is commonly performed with either an evacuated tube system (eg, Vacutainer; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or a syringe and needle or winged butterfly needle device (see Technique).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Examples of secondary membrane plasma fractionation include cascade filtration,\n [6] thermofiltration, cryofiltration,\n [7] and low-density lipoprotein pheresis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Principles of Microsurgery": "\nBackground\n\n\nMicrosurgery uses the operating room microscope or high-powered loupe magnification to facilitate the microvascular surgical techniques employed in anastomosing small vessels and nerves.\n [1]  Microsurgical reconstruction is applied to complex reconstructive surgery problems when other options (eg, primary closure, healing by secondary intention, skin grafting, and local or regional flap transfer) are not adequate.\nThe field of microsurgery began with the introduction of the operating microscope, when Jacobson and Suarez described the anastomosis of blood vessels. In the 1960s, as microsurgical techniques were perfected, increasing success was seen with digital artery repairs and finger replantation. This laid the foundation for microsurgical composite tissue transfer, which became popular in the 1970s.\n [2] \n\n\nIn the 1980s, an emphasis was placed on improved function with autologous tissue transplantation, which is exemplified by mandibular reconstructions for cancer. Composite grafts consisting of soft tissue and bone aided in stabilizing the mandible, assisted with mastication, and allowed reliable coverage during the postoperative period, when radiation usually was required. Today, microsurgical techniques have become an integral part of the armamentarium for plastic surgeons, allowing for soft-tissue coverage and function after trauma or oncologic resections.\nMicrosurgery may not be the best solution for all reconstructive dilemmas and usually is not the first choice in the reconstructive ladder. However, it can offer the reconstructive surgeon an important tool for achieving complex reconstruction by proceeding with free tissue transfer from distant sites.\n [3] Free tissue transfer includes flaps such as the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Isolated transfers\n         \n\n\n\n          Composite tissue transfers\n         \n\n\n\n          Functioning free muscle transfers\n         \n\n\n\n          Vascularized \n          bone grafts\n\n\n\n\n          Toe transplantation\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, specific tissue transfers such as neural grafts or vein grafts are also considered examples of free tissue transfer. In specific cases, such as large defects of the face after tumor resection, free tissue transfer may be the best option for closure of the defect.\n\nReconstructive microsurgery has entered a stage where, because of continued developments in technology and a better understanding of the anatomy, anastomosis of very small vessels (0.3 mm) is possible. These highly challenging procedures are referred to in the literature as supermicrosurgery.\n [4] They allow anastomosis of perforator flaps such as the medial plantar flap to perforator recipient vessels.\n [5]  Additional applications include complex digit reimplantation and lymphatic anastomosis.\n\nNewer optical and robotic systems are being developed for microsurgery and supermicrosurgery; further study is required.\n [6, 7] \n\nAlthough microsurgery continues to develop, the basic principles of microsurgery remain the same:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Select patients carefully\n         \n\n\n\n          Develop a careful preoperative plan and a backup plan\n         \n\n\n\n          Use a well-defined workhorse flap\n         \n\n\n\n          Obtain full patient consent\n         \n\n\n\n          Pay attention to intraoperative details\n         \n\n\n\n          Employ meticulous microsurgical technique\n         \n\n\n\n          Remain vigilant during postoperative care\n         \n\n\nThis article outlines the basics of microsurgery, preoperative planning, specific operative techniques, and postoperative care.

If hemorrhage continues, the other likely sources of bleeding include the retrohepatic vena cava and hepatic veins.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Radial Artery Sheath Insertion": "\nBackground\n\n\nThe radial artery access sheath is used to gain arterial access and facilitate the insertion of catheters or other equipment for diagnostic and vascular interventions.\n [1]  Compared with procedures performed via the commonly used femoral artery access route, procedures performed via the radial artery route allow shorter recovery time, earlier ambulation, earlier discharge, and lower incidences of access-site complications, as well as being advantageous for patients with occlusive aortoiliac disease or peripheral vascular disease.\nHowever, specific challenges exist in using radial artery sheath access. The radial artery is smaller than the femoral artery, and thus, more finesse and experience are required to access this vessel. In addition, a smaller sheath precludes the use of larger catheters and equipment, which may be needed for major operations. Finally, radial artery spasm is a risk, necessitating routine use of antispasmodic medications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Renal Artery Angioplasty": "\nBackground\n\n\nPercutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the renal artery has become an increasingly widespread peripheral vascular intervention for the treatment of renovascular hypertension (HTN). Catheter-based procedures began in 1964 when Charles Dotter initially developed PTA for treating peripheral vascular atherosclerosis. Andreas Grüntzig revolutionized the technique in 1974 when he developed a soft, flexible, double-lumen balloon catheter for use in coronary arteries.\nPTA has since rapidly evolved into a widely used, versatile, and dependable vascular interventional technique. Excellent results may be achieved in the renal arteries if patients are well selected and if experienced clinicians perform the procedure.

It is associated with increased morbidity because patients with severe HTN who have renovascular HTN are at increased risk for renal insufficiency.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional therapeutic modalities that include drug therapy and surgical revascularization have too many shortcomings. Medicines frequently fail to adequately control the patient's blood pressure (BP) adequately despite polypharmacy, and they may cause undesirable adverse effects. Patients may be noncompliant with pharmacotherapy. Moreover, lowering BP in the presence of severe renal stenosis may lead to ischemic renal atrophy.\n\nSurgery imparts considerable morbidity, and results vary. The associated need for general anesthesia may cause complications in patients, who are often poor candidates because of diffuse atherosclerosis or renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, the correction of renal stenosis is considered the treatment of choice whenever feasible.\n\nSince its introduction in 1978, percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) has emerged as a highly effective technique for the correction of renal artery stenosis (RAS). Renal angioplasty has notable physiologic, psychological, and economic advantages over other treatment modalities, and it should be considered the therapy of choice for renovascular HTN.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] \n\nAlone or in combination with stent implantation, PTRA is increasingly used as an alternative to surgical revascularization for the treatment of RAS, which may cause HTN or jeopardize renal function. Technical success is usually achieved in more than 85% of cases; the failure rate is 10%.\n\nPTRA-related complications occur in 7% of patients (see Technique). An overall benefit on BP control is observed in 20-40% of patients with atherosclerotic RAS (ARAS) and 60-70% of those with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD; see Outcomes). Independent of etiology, PTRA appears to be technically effective in correcting RAS. However, its position with respect to medical or surgical treatment must be better defined through randomized controlled studies aimed at comparing the clinical efficacies of these approaches.\n [12, 13, 14] \n\nEtiology of renal artery stenosis\nRAS has multiple causes, but most lesions are the result of atherosclerosis. FMD is the second most common etiology.\n [15] (See the image below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenal artery stenosis in patient with medically refractory renovascular hypertension. \n\nView Media Gallery\n\n\n\nThe incidence of RAS in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n          RAS occurs in 62% of patients with \n          peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and HTN\n          \n [16] \n\n\n\n\n          RAS is found in 33% of patients with \n          coronary artery disease (CAD)\n         \n\n\n\n          About 18% of patients with CAD have stenoses of greater than 50%\n          \n [17] \n\n\n\n\n          Both CAD and renal insufficiency are independent predictors for RAS\n         \n\n\n\n          The incidence of bilateral RAS is approximately 46%\n          \n [18] \n\n\n\nRegarding asymptomatic RAS, as many as 50% of patients with RAS do not have HTN. The incidence of progression of RAS is variable, but progression occurs in most patients. The overall progression rate is 49%, with 14% of patients developing total occlusion. Serum creatinine values do not adequately mirror progressive anatomic disease, and control of HTN does not thwart progression of RAS. The absence of HTN after PTRA does not preclude restenosis.\n\nRAS is frequently underdiagnosed.\n\nARAS is a common condition that is often but not necessarily associated with HTN. Because of its progressive nature, ARAS is becoming one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Indeed, ARAS is reported to progress within 5 years in 51% of patients, and renal atrophy develops in 21% of patients in whom ARAS is initially greater than 60% of the caliber of the vessel.\n\nRAS may occur in the setting of a transplant (transplant RAS, or TRAS) and is often treated with endovascular techniques.\n [19, 20, 21] A study by Chen et al found stenting to be superior to angioplasty alone for treating TRAS.\n [22] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

Moreover, in the midst of resuscitation,\n [11, 12, 13] this vein's location distant from the primary resuscitative efforts centered on the head, neck, and torso affords unhindered access to the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

For more information, see Vascular Access in Children.\nPlacing an IV line into a peripheral vein in a small child or infant can be a difficult task, for many reasons. Small children and infants have smaller peripheral veins, they may have more subcutaneous fat, they are prone to vasoconstriction, and they are much less likely to remain motionless and cooperative during a painful procedure than adults. The scalp veins provide a secondary option for peripheral intravascular access in small children and infants by virtue of the minimal subcutaneous fat, the reduced movement, and the lack of a flexible joint; these factors reduce the likelihood of catheter dislodgment, which is common with IV catheters placed in the arms or legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",

        "Transvenous Cardiac Pacing": "\nBackground\n\n\nThis article describes transvenous cardiac pacing. In a healthy heart, electrical impulses are generated in the sinoatrial (SA) node (sinus node), which is near the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right atrium (RA). The specialized cells of the SA node generate electrical impulses faster than other parts of the conduction system and with automaticity; therefore, these cells are usually the dominant natural pacemakers of the heart. The impulse is then conducted through the RA and left atrium (LA) and reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node.\nThe AV junction, which is at the base of the interatrial septum and extends into the interventricular septum, has two main parts: the AV node in the upper part, and the bundle of His in the lower part. In a healthy heart, the AV node is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. The inherent delay in transmitting the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles provides the appropriate diastolic duration to enable ventricular filling.\n\n\nThe His bundle divides into the left and right bundle branches and then into the Purkinje fibers, which conduct the impulse rapidly through the ventricles to produce rapid and simultaneous ventricular contractions. In general, symptomatic abnormalities of the conduction system are the main indications for cardiac pacing, a method by which a small pulsed electrical current is artificially delivered to the heart.\nOf the several methods for temporary pacing of the heart (transcutaneous, transvenous, transesophageal, transthoracic, and epicardial), transvenous and transcutaneous cardiac pacing are the most commonly used. The main factor that dictates the use of one approach instead of another is the urgency of the need for pacing.\n\n\n\n\nIn an emergency where a patient is experiencing cardiac symptoms or asystole, transcutaneous pacing is the method of choice. Nevertheless, transvenous pacing has the following advantages over the transcutaneous method:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Enhanced patient comfort\n         \n\n\n\n          Greater reliability\n         \n\n\n\n          Ability to pace the atrium\n         \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, because transvenous pacing requires central venous access, it cannot be initiated as fast as transcutaneous pacing can, and it is associated with several complications that result from obtaining venous access.\n\nA common scenario is one in which transcutaneous pacing is employed first in an emergency, followed by transvenous placement of a lead that will enable a longer period of pacing and evaluation in patients who may require permanent pacing later during their hospitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Umbilical Artery Catheterization": "\nBackground\n\n\nUmbilical artery catheterization is a common procedure in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and has become the standard of care for arterial access in neonates.\n [1] The umbilical artery can be used for arterial access during the first 5-7 days of life, but it is rarely used beyond 7-10 days. Placement of an umbilical artery catheter is easy in principle but often challenging in practice.\nUmbilical artery catheterization affords direct access to the arterial blood supply and allows accurate measurement of arterial blood pressure, serves as a source of arterial blood sampling, and provides intravascular access for fluids and medications.\n [2] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n",
        "Umbilical Vein Catheterization": "\nBackground\n\n\nUmbilical vein catheterization may be a life-saving procedure in neonates who require vascular access and resuscitation. The umbilical vein remains patent and viable for cannulation until approximately 1 week after birth. After proper placement of the umbilical line, intravenous (IV) fluids and medication may be administered to critically ill neonates.\n [1] \nWhen critically ill newborns present to the emergency department, peripheral access is preferred. If this is impossible, umbilical vein catheterization may be attempted.\n\n\nIntraosseous access is another option that can be used in neonates. Evidence suggests that intraosseous access may be obtained more rapidly than umbilical vein access would be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next: \n       \n\n\n\n"
