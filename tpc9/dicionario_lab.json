Confirmation that the inhibitory activity is phospholipid-dependent by relative correction of the abnormal clotting time when the concentration of phospholipid is increased in the screening test(s) that yielded abnormal results; this step confirms that the cause of abnormal mixing study is LAC (phospholipid-dependent inhibitor), not a specific factor inhibitor; knowing the clinical history helps in diagnosis—thrombosis in case of LAC or hemorrhage in the case of factor deficiency\n\n\n\n\n4.

Viral tests (nucleic acid or antigen detection tests) are used to assess acute infection, whereas antibody tests provide evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. (The US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] has not authorized the use of antibody tests for the diagnosis of acute infection.)\n\n\nCell culture isolation of SARS-CoV-2 is possible, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinical laboratories not attempt this unless it is performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3)–certified laboratory.\nWith any type of laboratory test, the clinical accuracy or reliability depends on performance characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity, as well as the pretest probability that a person has SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prevalence of COVID-19 in the local community.

The mechanism of action of progesterone-containing contraceptives is to suppress GnRH.\nProgesterone decreases endometrial proliferation and develops secretory endometrium. The abrupt decline in progesterone toward the end of the cycle causes the onset of menstruation. The effect of estrogen causing endometrial hyperplasia is necessary prior to the effect of progesterone on the endometrium for the normal menstrual pattern. Progesterone causes the endocervical glands to secrete a scant viscid material that decreases penetration of the cervix by sperm.

        "Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing": "Overview\n\n\nBackground\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by normal prostate cells. This enzyme participates in the dissolution of the seminal fluid coagulum and plays an important role in fertility. The highest amounts of PSA are found in the seminal fluid, although some PSA escapes the prostate and can be found in the serum.\n [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  PSA was originally identified by scientists in Japan. The government had requested that a means be found to identify semen in rape victims. The protein the researchers identified was called semenogelin. \n\n\nIn the United States, Richard Ablin and his associates independently identified this protein, which they called prostate-specific antigen. They were also looking for an identification method for semen in rape victims but were unaware of the Japanese research, since the journal in which that work had been published was not readily available to them.\nBecause the protein has since been found in other parts of the body and is also present in small amounts in women, the term prostate-specific antigen is a bit of a misnomer.\n\n\n\n\nPSA is not a true diagnostic test for prostate cancer, but rapidly rising values of PSA in the serum may be associated with prostate cancer.\n [7] The PSA level also tends to rise in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and usually increases as the prostate grows. PSA levels are also typically elevated in men with acute bacterial prostatitis. Even though \"normal\" PSA values are listed, each male has his own PSA value, and changes may reflect a number of events. \n\n\n\n\nSince 1986, when tests for measuring PSA levels in serum were introduced into clinical practice, early diagnosis and management of prostate cancer has been revolutionized, and much has been learned about the strengths and weaknesses of these assays. PSA testing not only helps identify men in whom a prostate biopsy would be appropriate but also assists in assessing the response to therapy, determining tumor progression, and, in its most controversial role, screening for prostate cancer.\n [8, 9, 10] \n\nStudies have indicated that a PSA of less than 1 confers a 1.5% probability of developing an active cancer. A PSA of greater than 4 increases the probability to 29.5%. \n\nThe prostate begins growing around age 40 years and never stops. It may be walnut sized in young men, but in men over age 40 years the gland can attain a much greater size. As stated above, the PSA tends to increase as the prostate becomes larger.\n\nThe image below depicts the anatomy of the prostate gland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProstate is small gland, about size and shape of walnut, that is part of male reproductive system. It sits low in pelvis, below bladder and just in front of rectum. Prostate helps make semen, which carries sperm from testicles through penis during ejaculation. It surrounds part of urethra, which carries urine out of bladder and through penis.

Studies have found that  PSA screening makes a real difference in the detection of this disease and subsequent patient survival.\n\nBefore the PSA era, an abnormality in the prostate had to be palpably evident before a biopsy would be performed, and nearly 70% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer already had extraprostatic or metastatic disease. Since the advent of PSA evaluation, fewer than 3% of men have metastases at the time of diagnosis, and 75% of men have nonpalpable cancer, with the cancer being detected from a biopsy performed because of a rapidly rising or markedly elevated PSA level.\n\nDespite the apparent survival advantage conferred by PSA screening, in 2008 the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against screening for prostate cancer in men aged 75 years or older, and in 2012 the task force recommended against screening regardless of age.\n [49] The USPSTF has since modified this position and currently supports a dialogue between the patient and the doctor. There is no specific age restriction for obtaining and tracking PSA. Men with a family history of prostate cancer can begin screening at age 40 years. The initial PSA sets the baseline.\n [11] \n\nConsistent with the USPSTF’s recommendations against prostate cancer screening, the detected incidence of prostate cancer dropped between 2007 and 2014, falling by approximately 40%. However, between 2014 and 2019, the incidence rose by 3% annually, this increase having resulted from an annual rise of about 4.5% in diagnoses of regional- and distant-stage prostate cancer. The increased incidence of advanced-stage disease actually started as early as 2011.\n [49, 50] \n\nThe 2010 update of the American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline for early detection of prostate cancer stresses the importance of involving patients in deciding whether or not to test for prostate cancer. The ACS notes that PSA testing may reduce the likelihood of dying from prostate cancer but that there may be risks associated with the treatment of prostate cancer that would not have developed if the disease had been left undetected.\n [12]  Of course, there may also be risks if a cancer is not detected.\n\nMost clinicians determine which men should undergo PSA testing on the basis of age, symptoms, family history, expected longevity, general medical condition, physical examination findings, and, often, the patient’s request for the test. Urologists obtain PSA measurements for most of their male patients in the appropriate age group because they believe that they have an obligation to detect any prostate cancer at the earliest possible stage of its development.\n\nThe leading cause of malpractice claims against urologists is the failure to diagnose prostate cancer in a timely manner. Primary care physicians and internists also are increasingly being held liable for failure to obtain PSA testing for their patients and for failure to refer those with elevated PSA levels to a urologist.\n\nPhysicians have an obligation to discuss the risks and benefits of PSA testing with their patients. Ample information about PSA testing is also available from the American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association. Unfortunately, the Internet contains a lot of misinformation on the subject. \n\nThe current strategy before performing a prostate biopsy is to obtain a prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This imaging study can indicate the location of sites within the prostate that are suspicious for cancer. On a scale of 1-5, a 1/5 or a 2/5 indicates a low probability for a cancer being present. A 4/5 or a 5/5 indicates a high probability, 70-90%, for the presence of cancer cells. A 3/5 indicates a 30-50% probability of cancer. By denoting abnormal sites within the prostate, MRI allows \"targeted\" biopsies to be done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next:",
